0.809500	I am always worried about the outside chance that I may develop a serious condition, like heart disease.

0.761900	I am transgendered and I have been treated hideously by many medical professiols because of it. Add this to the fact that I believe very little of what doctors say and you probably get the idea.

0.785700	The possibility that I will have a serious health problem. Also there is the possibility of embarrassment.

0.547600	The unknowing of how they will treat my condition. I have gone through a lot of medications and it can be tough on me.

0.547600	Waiting for the doctor and fear of judgement.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried, because I'm not a worrier.  Maybe about how much it will cost....
0.476200	I usually go to the doctor only when I have a health issue. Sometimes I get worried that I might have a serious condition or am getting worse
0.285700	I do not feel any of this
0.357100	It's uncomfortable to be that vulnerable.
0.619000	Generally I don't go to the doctor unless I know something is wrong, so it's the wondering what the problem is

0.261900	I don't really get anxious or worried, I just get bored with the long wait and the hassle of it.  The only time I've felt anxious at a doctor's office was when I was getting my cheek biopsy because they were thinking it was skin cancer (it was). And then the surgery and reconstructive surgeries made me feel anxious because I was worried about scarring.
0.452400	if I go in and have no clue what's going on. A completely new thing never experienced before and cant ID it well

0.619000	Mostly relatively minor phobias about things like needles.
0.500000	I feel anxious about telling the doctor what is wrong.  I'm afraid he won't take my symptoms seriously.

0.381000	Just the uncertainty if I have a major illness that is going to kill me
0.595200	I'm afraid that they will try to force me to get a procedure that I don't want.

0.904800	They will hurt me in the examination process or will be unkind to me and not believe me when I explain issues I have with my health.
0.214300	In general I think it is just something that everyone feels when they go to a doctors office.  You are just fearful of what they will say it is just the general fear of the unknown
0.571400	My medical condition, if I think it is serious
0.523800	I'm mostly worried if I have no idea what the problem might already be. I usually have an idea of what the issue is before I go and the uncertainty, when I have it, is difficult.
0.166700	Just if something is wrong. I don't want to be unhealthy or discover a bad problem. 
0.142900	Finding something wrong
0.666700	They will rush me through. There is a large population here. In my small town growing up everyone knew everyone. I went to church with my doctor. Here all they want to know is what kind of insurance you have. Usually they don't take mine. I just don't go and treat myself. I avoid vaccinations and unnecessary treatments. 
0.142900	The long wait at times.
0.523800	Them finding something out that could be really wrong with me. I want everything to be okay and get a good report.
0.666700	The idea that he might find something really wrong with me. I worry about contracting a terrible disease.
0.547600	I feel the most anxious about getting my blood pressure tested. 
0.666700	They aren't careful. They're in a hurry.
0.238100	most likely the unknown of what exactly is wrong.

0.714300	I fear the end result or diagnosis.
0.500000	I only go when I think something is terribly wrong, so I am worried that I might be right and it's not some simple ailment.

0.761900	I WORRY THATY I CANNOT ACCURATELY EXPLAIN SO SHE WILL UNDERSTAND
0.547600	i am just curious. i want to know what help i will need. I also want to know if there is something i should be concerned about
0.881000	I am always worried that the doctor will find something bad.  Even though I know there is nothing I can do about it I am almost convinced every time I go in for a visit I will leave in a worse case scerio

0.619000	that something will be wrong and it is unexpected.
0.714300	I am very paranoid and I feel that things never work out for me. I always dread and fear the worst,
0.738100	I don't like doctor's offices, needles, or exams. Anything out of my normal routine makes me nervous.
0.428600	When I am not sure what to expect or am not quite sure what is wrong with me, then I get a little anxious or concerned.
0.881000	Going to a doctor could always mean something bad. You never know what you're going to find out when you're there. So it makes me fearful every time I go to one

0.285700	I become anxious about blood draws and injections.
0.452400	I just am always curious what is going on with my body and I am hopeful that it isn't too serious. I don't know what they are planning once I get into the exam room. So, this sense of unease leads to some anxiety.
0.142900	I sometimes feel anxious that I will be waiting in the exam room forever, especially when I have other plans after the appointment.
0.452400	IM WORRIED HE IS GOING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME EVEN IF I AM JUST THERE FOR A YEARLY PHYSICAL
0.285700	Getting bad news like cancer
0.142900	No, I never worry.
0.714300	I am most anxious about hearing bad news. I am worried that something would pop up positive on tests. 
0.476200	just that they will find something i dont know about or wont truly listen to me
0.357100	The only thing would be the uncertainty. Not knowing what my problem is. 
0.142900	I'm never really anxious when I go to the doctor. The only thing that would make me anxious is if I was experiencing horrible pain but didn't know where it came from 
0.428600	Probably just that I am worried that there's something wrong or that it's worse than I imagined. 
0.142900	Blood work or additiol studies that might be needed and take a few hours for results. 
0.595200	It's most worrisome when you don't know what the results are going to be. It could be bad or it could be good, you don't really know what you're going to hear. Most of the times it ends up being good so worrying is probably unnecessary.
0.357100	Just worrying about what might be wrong with me. I hate to be sick, but I trust my doctor.
0.190500	That there could be something wrong.
0.404800	Un unknown illness or condition.
0.428600	Potential of the doctor finding health problems.
0.476200	That something might be wrong.
1.000000	I am most scared I am going to get a death sentence. I have really bad health anxiety.
0.642900	They probably aren't qualified to do what they do. They are LARPing.
0.642900	I have a tendency to think the worst. I am a pessimist. I think something much worse is wrong with me than ever is.

0.547600	The cost

0.500000	That they won't take me seriously.

0.142900	I would feel anxious if they did testing and looked at the results and said things didn't look good. 
0.142900	Nothing usually. I am generally very comfortable visiting the doctor. 
0.785700	I am anxious that my doctor will criticize my lifestyle or my habits without seeing me as a person. I am worried that my doctor will not listen to me. I am worried that something will be wrong with me.
0.214300	I have had some medical isseus in the past and I always worry it may come up again 
0.785700	Having someone exam my body and tell me that I'm unhealthy. 
0.595200	I feel the most anxious about how much money it will cost me when I'm there. If I'm told I have a serious medical affliction, I practically have to accept my death. This is understandably unsettling to cope with, and thus I to an extent don't want to visit a doctor for this reason.
0.809500	What kind of tests will they have to do? Will they hurt? Will it be expensive? What if they find something serious? Will I have to have surgery? How will that alter my way of life? Do I have the time in the day to tend to all of this? 
0.333300	I worry that I won't get the full attention of the doctor and won't get all my questions answered. 
0.761900	I want to live forever, but as I get closer to 40, I've had a few more issues.  I hate that I now have to start getting rectal exams and things like that.  I just don't ever want to get bad news.
0.452400	I do not enjoy having someone exam my genital area. Otherwise, it is par for the course.

0.142900	Lack of compassion and understanding. Also, acknowledging the existance of chronic Lyme disease at some point would be nice. 
0.238100	Fear of my health getting worse.
0.285700	It doesn't really apply because I'm not anxious or worried when I go for appointments.
0.571400	It's an unfamiliar environment and people usually go to the doctor's office when there is something wrong with them healthwise or they are afraid something could be wrong. The uncertainty is likely what causes me the most anxiety.
0.714300	That they will cause me more harm than good. 
0.142900	Nothing does, I have no anxiety when visiting a doctor.
0.285700	The thought of maybe them finding something wrong. 
0.714300	I'm always worried they're going to find a lump or something that indicates cancer or another scary disease that would change or end my life.
0.571400	I usually feel anxious because if I am at the doctors office there is something wrong.  Something wrong means it's going to cost a lot of money.  I don't have health insurance because I can't afford it.
0.571400	I'm done writing pal, this is ridiculous for the pay.  
0.142900	I only feel anxious or worried when I know I am about to receive a shot.
0.238100	Them finding something bad.  ALso, something that may be uncomfortable physically, like a shot or a procedure.
0.571400	That they will try to give me a shot....I HATE needles. Or that they will tell me something is wrong with me. 
0.595200	Just that I never know what they are going to say. Also that I may not agree with what they say or they may want me to do things I don't want to do. It's just that unforseen things can happen.
0.142900	idk why but the only thing that makes me a little anxious is having my blood pressure checked. For some reason when the cup goes on my anxiety shoots up and they always have to retake my blood pressure a second time.
0.857100	possibility of their being something seriously wrong with me; judgement from the doctor.
0.690500	That they are going to tell me that I am overweight or shame me for my weight. 
0.357100	I get nervous about the unknown.  So the until I see the doctor I am a bit worried
0.595200	I worry that they will not help me deal with my health issues but will send me away with no help. I feel that my health concerns are rarely taken seriously enough. 
0.452400	Whether my condition is more serious than I expected
0.428600	I worry that something minor will turn out to be something major. I'm not a hypochondriac, and I don't worry about stuff all the time. It's just that health can be complicated sometimes.
0.714300	When I am just waiting for the results from everything.  My mind will keep thinking of the worst outcome until I hear a solid response.
0.666700	I worry that the doctor won't listen to my concerns or do anything to help me, or that he still won't diagnose my chronic health issues yet again.

0.642900	There's always a chance that they are going to see something horrible.
0.214300	I get anxious when I have to get weighed because I already know I have to lose weight. I also get anxious when I need to have blood taken or I may be worried if I am waiting for some type of results. 
0.738100	I have health conditions which could lead to serious problems. Especially when my doctor is looking for signs of cancer, I'm anxious. I know that it could be bad news for me.
0.881000	The anticipation of the exam results is the most nerve wracking. There may be something that I wasn't aware about such as cancer. 
0.500000	Generally I am worried about the bad news I may receive.  I feel that if I get a bad prognosis then I am doomed to an extremely expensive medical bill as my insurance has a relatively high deductible.
0.214300	finding out
0.452400	I have social anxiety. I feel nervous about interacting with the doctor and staff. I feel inferior.

0.428600	I don't tend to get anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I think if I had a serious medical condition, the not knowing if I was going to get better or worse would make me the most anxious. I don't get nervous for annual check-ups.

0.976200	I feel the most anxious about visiting a doctor in general because of the dread of the diagnosis.  I am worried about what a doctor will find wrong with me. I am also worried about the fincial burden tests will entail.
0.238100	Just wondering what could be wrong or what my examition outcome might be.
0.309500	When I am feeling very bad, I worry that it may be something serious.  Also, having to wait in the lobby and then in the room makes me anxious because I sometimes have to wait a long time.   The exam room has no windows and I sometimes feel claustrophobic. 
0.285700	I don't like waiting around sick people.
0.714300	I feel anxious about getting the right service I need. I feel anxious about the cost 
0.142900	The waiting period is difficult. It is hard to sit there and wait for the doctor
0.142900	Nerves in general. No one likes to go to the doctors. But int he long run you know you need to go, even if its for something small. Because that small thing could be something large and if you didnt go something worse could happen to you.

0.357100	I always think they will find something I didn't expect before entering. No one likes hearing bad news about their health, because it could be worse than they thought.

0.619000	I worry about getting bad news.

0.476200	Waiting in line, hoping I didn't actually break something. In my wife's case, it was questioning who made the decision to have an OBGYN look at what turned out to not me a problem. I also don't like receiving bad news, which thankfully I largely didn't.
0.619000	I don't like needles and there is always a worry that they will find something that is serious. I worry they will find cancer or something like that when examining me. I don't want to have to battle a serious health issue so I get a little anxious.

0.738100	Being told I'm not healthy.

0.690500	I have a neuro condition and there are a lot of uncertainties around it. So when I have to be seen for it, it can be a long experience full of many questions. With uncertainties, it causes me anxiety because I don't have a game plan set it stone. If i have a reason why things happen, or a plan, i can deal with it, but when I don't have answers, it makes me nervous.
0.285700	I feel most anxious or worried that there will be some bad diagnosis but in general I don't tend to worry about this because I have good health.  I would only worry if I had symptoms that were concerning or alarming, and this has never really happened to me.

0.381000	I think I am generally uncomfortable with visiting a doctor's office.

I am also a bit disturbed by having to share breathing space with other sick people in the waiting room, etc...
0.333300	The potential of my doctor finding that something is wrong with me or that I'm living an unhealthy lifestyle. While I'm generally healthy, I fear that something could change that.
0.738100	I worry that somehow she will find something wrong with me that could be serious. I also get nervous when explaining symptoms to my doctor and then to get overly anxious and sometimes cry. 
0.595200	I am afraid I will have testing that results in me being put on more medication or that something termil will show up that I've missed
0.142900	I dont get anxious, hes doing his job and will tell me what he thinks. Yeah there could be bad answers like i got cancer or something but for the most part its not that heavy
0.142900	I wouldn't say that visiting the doctor in general makes me anxious, but there are certain procedures that I do dislike and cause me to be apprehensive, such as having blood taken, or having to take off clothes. 
0.500000	I don't think I'm actually a hypochondriac, but my mind always shoots to the worst possible scerio when something is wrong. I'm worried that I'll be too anxious to appropriately describe the issue I'm having and just hope that the doctor figures out what's wrong on his own.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office.
0.595200	Worried nervous
0.476200	I worry about what the doctors will find. The thought of being really sick bothers me.
0.666700	I might feel more anxious because the doctor could tell me something that I dont want to hear.  I have some minor medical conditions that could be getting worse.
0.142900	I never feel anxious or worried when i visit a doctors office even if i have a serious problem so this doesnt really apply to me.
0.476200	I'm always worried that a problem may be worse than I anticipate.
0.857100	If something's wrong with me that I can't afford, things could get bad pretty quickly. Plus, I just want to know what it is. It's nerve-wracking.
0.476200	It is not the most comfortable environment, and I may have a medical condition I am concerned about.
0.333300	I don't like being examined (especially pap smears) and getting shots. I feel most anxious about pain from shots and blood tests.
0.619000	"Not knowing what will happen. You usually see a doctor when something is ""wrong"" and you're trying to figure out what it could be. "
0.547600	I worry a lot that I am not being told what I, as an individual need to do. I feel as though there are very standard treatments and more often that not, these are not the best for every single individual.
0.119000	Honestly, the only thing that bothers me is the long wait. Besides that.... nothing really makes me anxious...I figure the worst that will happen is I find out I have some kind of flesh eating disease.
0.571400	That staff will be rude or mean. That I will have a condition
0.738100	i worry that they are going to have bad news for me. i also worry that they are simply judging me. i also worry that things will arise that cost a lot of money. 
0.476200	I don't like drawing blood. Last time I went to the doctor they stuck me three times and couldn't get any because I was so tense. They told me to go to a lab and I refuse to, even if I probably should see my lab results. 
0.476200	White coat syndrome. just going into the office, and the fear of the unknown.  Finding out something is really wrong.
0.142900	I have not had any worries when visiting the doctors office.
0.714300	Needles. I absolutely hate them due to having injections into my neck that hurt so bad I passed out. I'd rather have my appendix removed (again) than have those injections done again.
0.666700	The unknown of what is going on with me. 
0.571400	If I think something is wrong with me. If I haven't been there in a long time.
0.476200	I sometimes feel anxious during exams, specifically the well woman exams. I usually just try to breathe and relax, and ask questions when I am unsure of something.
0.500000	I am anxious when i visit the doctor and I can not pin point why I am. I feel like she is rushed and if I have a concern that day they she is not going to talk to me about it. It sort of makes it feel like pointless to even go in to the office.
0.714300	I always worry if they will make a mistake if its something being done. Also, I wonder if theyll find something else wrong. I worry also that I will make them uncomfortable.
0.571400	That i am going to be sick. That the doctor will be rude
0.761900	I think the thing I'm most worried about is that they will find something wrong with me that I'm not even aware of. Something that could drastically change my life.
0.642900	I am always worried that I am going to find out something that I don't want to hear. For instance, I am worried I could be diagnosed with a major health issue. Also, I fear sometimes that I will be reprimanded for not properly taking care of myself in between visits. 
0.285700	I worry about if my condition has got worse. But I hope I hear they have found a cure.
0.500000	I just don't want to be unhealthy and that makes me anxious. The thought of there being something wrong and how I could afford to take care of myself. 
0.476200	You never know if the reason you're going in is more serious than you thought it was going to be. Plus it can be a stressful situation, especially if you aren't feeling well
0.714300	I am most worried about the bill.
0.785700	I get worried they won't be nice. I worry that they might look down on me. I worry that they might try to make me fearful. I've experienced this with some doctors. I've also had ones that don't listen and act annoyed when I ask simple questions. This is what I worry about.
0.428600	I think it's just the fear of the unknown. If I'm not going for any particular reason, you never know what they could find that could be potentially bad. It's just a little scary.
0.214300	I have a history of certain medical conditions and I'm getting to an age where those conditions may be more likely to occur.
0.428600	Unsure of what will happen. 
0.309500	You never know what to expect in an office. Sometimes just having to wait a long period of time for a dr. to show up makes you feel anxious. Too much time to think and worry.
0.714300	I feel most anxious about whether or not I will receive a bad diagnosis.  Often I let my mind wander into the worst of possible situations.  It would be horrifying to me if I received a diagnosis like cancer.
0.309500	I usually just get anxious that they'll ask me to do something that makes me uneasy, like having my blood drawn. I have no real reason for it, but I dread having my blood drawn. I'd like for it to stay where it is.
0.690500	I have panic disorder so I'm almost always anxious and worried. But I don't like to think that my doctor will find something termil like cancer.
0.285700	You always hear horror stories about doctors finding serious issues during routine checks. Although the odds are minuscule the thoughts still cross my mind 
0.428600	Visiting the doctor's office, one usually feels apprehensive. The reason for this is that there's always a chance they can find something else wrong than what currently ails an individual.

0.261900	There is always a possibility that you could have something major wrong with you such as cancer or a disease.
0.214300	The thought of my numbers for my blood tests being bad are what worries me the most.
0.285700	I feel most anxious about getting test results and the impending decision that will need to be made based on those results. It makes me anxious about overthinking the decision or making the wrong choice.
0.785700	I may receive life-altering information. Or, to treat something, I may start heading down the wrong path when it comes to treatment. The cost is also a concern. 
0.309500	getting bad news
0.547600	I generally do not get worried when entering doctor's offices due to the fact that I usually have a general idea of what is wrong with me.
0.738100	I had a bad experience with my doctor when my daughter was born and from then on going back makes me nervous that something else will happen. 
0.452400	It's mostly wondering about if I actually have a condition that is wrong with me. It doesn't have much to do with them being a shady doctor.
0.500000	I am concerned that there is something going wrong with my body 
0.190500	I only feel a very small amount of anxiety in case something comes up that I wasn't aware of.
0.285700	I'm not usually either of these things. It's the not knowing prior to the doctors that leaves me anxious. Going there I feel relief.
0.142900	If I feel anxious and worried, it must be the test result have some issue and doctor needs to talk to me personnel.
0.714300	I am not in as good as shape as I would like.  I don't like being ked and being fat.
0.714300	Just hearing or getting back the results from tests or seeing what I've read or seen is true.  Guessing that the worst may come true from what the doctor says.
0.357100	If they look at the chart, and then exit the room immediately. This happened when I had interl bleeding from a wrestling accident. I immediately knew it was more serious than I initially thought.
0.976200	I have to go so long between visits to a physician, and my general health and nutrition are so poor that I dread hearing I have a serious illness every time I go. I worry about my wellbeing. I fear that years of poor health and dental care will catch up to me every time I see a physician.
0.428600	"I am worried that he will say something like ""this is rare"" or ""I have never seen this before"".  I want something routine that is easily eased."
0.642900	It's really only certain types of exams that make me feel nervous and dreading the appointment. These are procedures that I find extremely uncomfortable, so I put them off. Often, I don't get them done. 
0.214300	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor. Maybe if I had a condition I was sure was serious I might feel kind of anxious.
0.595200	I usually feel worried about what the results of my health assessment might be. I also get nervous about interacting with doctors (or people) in general, but I usually tell myself there isn't much to worry about just to calm myself down. 
0.690500	Just the fear that something may actually be wrong and I have no control over. It gives me a great deal of stress.
0.476200	I do not like going to the doctor's in general so when I have to go to a doctor I feel restless and worried sometimes for no reason.
0.142900	Only times I get nervous is when I am in the waiting room, surrounded by sick people. I really do wish more offices had a split up area where people going in for check ups or non contagious things could be sat away from those with spreadable sicknesses.
1.000000	I'm scared that she will find something wrong with me.  Something that will change my life.
0.547600	that theyre going to come throgh the door with some scary results.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious at the Dr. Maybe annoyed because of wait times.
0.381000	The most anxious aspect of visiting the doctor's office is waiting in the lobby to see the doctor. The actual process of talking to a doctor and getting tested isn't a problem for me as I'm a healthy individual.
0.142900	I am worried if they will have to give me a shot that day
0.285700	I usually am anxious anytime I am at a doctors office cause I always worry something will be wrong with me.
1.000000	finding out something bad about my health
0.595200	The biggest anxiety or worry would have to be the worry of receiving bad news about my health.
0.142900	In the back of my mind i worry that the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me like cancer and that is scary. But this is not at the forefront of my mind and i do not think of it often
0.857100	The doctor commenting on my weight
0.928600	Being weighed, being judged, not wanting to divulge information that may make me look bad. 
0.619000	The thought that something might be terribly wrong with me
0.285700	That he won't be able to fix the problem that I'm dealing with.
0.500000	I am just generally an anxious person. I do not like going to the doctor, especially if I know it will involve a blood draw. I do not do well around blood or needles. 
0.404800	I tend to be a hypochondriac so when something is bothering me enough to go to the doctor I worry that he will find something wrong with me. My mind can make me fear going to the doctor stronger than it should be by a lot.
0.761900	I always worried they will find something is wrong
0.357100	The most obvious thing in my eyes...that they will find something wrong that I was not aware of.   It is similar to getting your car worked on.  You always worry the mechanic will come out of the shop and say your &lt;auto part here&gt; is also broken. 
0.142900	I don't get anxious when visiting the doctor
0.285700	nothing at all
0.904800	I have anxiety in going to the doctor. I feel that the doctor will try and diagnose me with something that I do not have. 
0.452400	What makes me feel most anxious is when i'm sitting in the waiting room forever
0.666700	That I'm going to go in for one thing and have something else come up
0.452400	I always have that lingering fear at my yearly ladies appointment that it will be discovered that I have cancer or something.  I think many women feel that way. 
0.785700	My main worries are that my lab work would have shown something or that the doctor is dissatisfied with something in my health. My family has many health conditions that I am predisposed to that I also fear about showing eventually in my life.
0.357100	The thing that makes me the most anxious would be going in when I know something is truly wrong with me and not having any idea of the outcome - the uncertainty can be very worrisome. 
0.142900	Mostly time constrictions, which really has little to do with my doctor at all. She's pretty great, I must say.
0.142900	I am not usually anxious, but I guess it does cross my mind occasiolly that she may find something wrong during an exam.
0.428600	Trying to find out why I'm having certain symptoms 
0.690500	Just the not knowing if anything is seriously wrong. Also visits are usually annoying because you have to wait so long and it can be hard when you are sick. 
0.738100	Waiting for the doctor to give me results. Fear of the unknown.
0.285700	The cost associated with going to the doctor would be the only thing I worry about.

0.523800	I'm not particularly comfortable with anyone touching me. I also worry that something is terribly wrong with me.
0.142900	Mostly it's the cost of going to the doctor. I don't normally expect the worst as far as my health is concerned.  
0.261900	its mainly when i don't have a clue whats wrong and could be something serious.
0.142900	I AM WORRIED THEY ARE GOING TO FIND SOMETHING MAJOR THAT IS WRONG WITH ME.
0.738100	I just don't really like doctor's offices or hospitals in general. I worry that I will get some bad news though things are usually fine, but I worry a lot in general.
1.000000	Fear of whether or not there's something wrong with me, and fear of how much treatment will cost. 
0.142900	Nothing really. My current doctor takes care of me very well.
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor. 
0.571400	I always worry that a simple problem is actually something very serious 
0.761900	I usually imagine a worst case scerio, so I am worried about finding out something is seriously wrong with me. I also worry that the Doctor wont take my concerns seriously.
0.285700	Just having to be there, really. What if they find something wrong, what if there's some sort of problem, etc. Its more general, low key anxiety than anything specific. 
0.666700	I feel that anxious that my doctor will find something really wrong with me.  I worry that I will have to go to the hospital or have some procedure done.  It is the fear of having a serious medical condition.
0.761900	"The bill is number one with a bullet.  Then after that I would be most worried about whatever condition I came in for being worse than it appears, or worst case scerio a big ol' shrug of the shoulders from the doctor saying ""I don't know what causes that..."" then endless testing (oh wait that goes back to cost).  Also lost time I have to take off of work because no doctor keeps a schedule that takes into account peoples working schedule."
0.666700	when i have a problem i'm concerned about and they're trying to figure out what it is, and it becomes apparent it could be something bad
0.690500	I worry that they might find out I have a medical condition or disease that I will have to deal with. I am also nervous they might say I have not been taking good care of myself, like not exercising enough or not doing enough to watch my cholesterol.
0.619000	I am anxious because I know I am overweight, and I dread being weighed and measured. I am anxious about my blood-pressure reading and blood sugar readings, as high blood pressure and diabetes run in my family. 
0.857100	it makes me worried when i don't go as often as i should. So i know there is a possibility of being deficient in something that i could have prevented had i went like i was supposed to.
0.476200	That I may have to have a shot.
0.142900	I am not anxious at the doctor but if I had to pick something i would say just maybe anxious about shots/pain
0.642900	I would feel the most anxious about finding out bad news.  I would be worried about finding out I have a health problem.
0.904800	I am worried because I'm overweight and self conscious. I'm worried they will give me a hard time about my size. I'm worried they will find something wrong with me. 
0.571400	I don't like being examined and you never know what may come up.  There's always a worry that a doctor will find something wrong.  
0.238100	Strange environment, nervous about having to talk about myself and my issues. Having to bring up questions and concerns when they are doing things. 
0.904800	I guess, obviously, the thing that makes me most worried is the potential for finding something wrong. The second most worrying thing for me is being in that close proximity (prodded, touched) by someone. I also worry about catching something from all the sick people in the building.
0.881000	I don't want to have to take my clothes off. Most of the time the basic rule of society is to avoid being ked in front of other people, it's hard to adjust to the idea that it's supposed to be normal to do for medical professiols.
0.500000	I feel anxious because I am afraid my doctor will miss something because they don't care that much about my health they just want to prescribe me something expensive and then send me away. 
0.571400	For some reason I'm always afraid that they won't believe me or will think that I'm weird. I get weird looks sometimes because of the way I explain situations due to my anxiety. The nurses are generally good at making this okay, but the actual doctors generally seem too busy with their shift to fully give you their time and attention. 
0.571400	Being forced to make a decision in a short amount of time about something that can affect my life long term. I also have to shell out a lot of money for a service that has a high chance of not helping me.
0.571400	If I am at the doctor's office for a routine checkup I usually feel fine. If I am there for a problem, I sometimes worry about what the diagnosis will be, such as what is the exact problem, cause, and how long it will last. I tend to worry a lot about physical pain when I have an injury, and worry that it might not heal properly, or that I might be in pain for a long time.
0.857100	I don't like being touched or judged. 
0.333300	turally worrying whether or not all is well. I also think the enviornment of the doctors waiting room and the doctors room can be intimidating. 
0.714300	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor is going to discover a serious medical condition I did not know I had. I am anxious that this will affect my quality of life going forward. This makes me anxious to some degree about visits.
0.238100	I'm occasiolly nervous about what the diagnosis will be or if there will be one. There have been times that I've had to go back a few times before being referred and finding out what is really wrong. 
0.595200	Sometimes I just get worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I will need surgery or something too costly.
0.547600	I just don't like the sterility and seriousness in the office. It's not because I'm afraid of what's he's going to tell me.
0.571400	That something will be seriously wrong
0.714300	My condition is serious and currently I am in remission but every time I have a new scan and go to the doctor there is a chance something could show up so I am anxious
0.333300	I feel most anxious while I am waiting for test results to come back. Most often they are not bad news but it is the waiting that gets to me.
0.428600	Not knowing whats going on or why I feel the way I do (symptoms). Not knowing how long the wait times are.
0.571400	I just worry something bad will be found. That's always a possibility. I dont really like being touched by a stranger either.
0.166700	There is always a small risk present in many interactions. I am afraid that something will go unchecked sometimes.
0.738100	Going to the doctor is always a nerve-wracking experience. You never know what news you could get after a health examition.
0.714300	I don't like going to places I'm unfamiliar with. I don't like seeing sick people. Doctors offices usually have a real sad, depressing and anxious environment and feeling. 
0.428600	Just the anxiety of waiting to hear if anything is seriously wrong. I get worried when I have to wait, but I'm usually reassured in the end.
0.857100	He always tries to prescribe pills to me I don't want to take. An example is my blood pressure is normal, and yet he stills tries for me to get high blood pressure pills.
0.690500	That the doctor will find something wrong with my health.
0.357100	How long it takes. The test that I have to take.
0.738100	When they are scowling and in a bitter mood. It's not my fault but they still end up taking out their anger on me. It greatly pisses me off. So i go home think whether or not they truly told me what I needed to hear
0.476200	I get anxious because I am afraid that the dr. will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. 
0.690500	I am most anxious that the doctor will tell me that something is wrong. I know that if something is wrong, I will have to do/take something that is very inconvenient or expensive.
0.309500	Nothing in particular. As I said, I've been going to the same place for years, so I'm very comfortable there. I get a bit anxious when I'm sitting there waiting, simply because I hate waiting for anything.
0.714300	I guess wondering whether or not they are going to be honest with me. If I knew they are going to try to push an antibiotic or prescription, I'd already be defensive. I don't take pharmaceuticals. 
0.285700	I am sometimes worried that I'm not going to pass one of the tests and will have some sort of condition. Before going in, I feel like I don't know how healthy I am. 
0.523800	The results of tests and what might be wrong with my body.
0.761900	not knowing what they will find, or even if they will listen to what is going on with me
0.214300	I am most worried that the doctor will find something wrong.
0.142900	The one thing that would bring about this feeling is not knowing. When you have to wait on test results and you dont know what will be the outcome. 
0.547600	I feel the most anxious about being weighed or having my blood pressure taken and it is high.
0.404800	I don't honestly feel anxious when visiting the doctor. I am there to get help. I can imagine if I had a severe health problem that my anxiety level would be much higher but so far I have not had that experience.
1.000000	"Everything. The sights, sounds, smells... The possibility of learning something terrible about my health... The vulnerability of having to undress in front of people I don't know well... The humiliation of having issues blamed on my weight... I had a terrible pediatrician as a kid who berated and terrified me and snuck up on me with vaccitions, and I've had a lot of medical anxiety ever since. My ""white coat syndrome"" in regard to my blood pressure when I see a doctor is HORRIBLE."
0.404800	If I think something is actually wrong with me. I'll be a bit nervous until I get the results. Usually I try to keep calm.
0.404800	
0.142900	Not knowing how something is going to turn out. Whether a test is going to give not so great results or something else like that.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious in a doctor's office is the uncertainty of it. I don't like feeling bad and not knowing what is wrong, and wondering about the diagnosis can be nervewracking.
0.738100	Just sitting there wondering what they will find or if my condition is changing for the worse.
0.809500	I worry the doctor will find something I did not expect. I also worry that if something is wrong, it will be expensive to treat. I tend to fear for the worst.
0.857100	I always worry if they will find something wrong.  As I get older, this is more likely.
0.381000	Bad surprises.  Not getting satisfactory answers and/or individual attention
0.190500	Just that something might be wrong but only slightly have the feeling
0.285700	I am not typically anxious about visiting the doctor's office.
0.690500	I worry that my doctor would find something wrong with me. I want to go in there alive, and come out fine without any problems. I'm also not comfortable with people touching me, even if it is my doctor.
0.714300	What might be found that I wasn't aware of or couldn't see.  No one wants bad news, especially at the doctors!
0.404800	Unexpected changes in weight, blood pressure, etc. (i.e. the unknown.)
0.571400	Going to the doctors office is just an activity that makes me unsettled. Generally you go to the doctor to fix a problem, but if not then there is a good chance you may get sick after you leave since there are several other sick people there usually. If you have a specific problem you are struggling with (nerve pain, for example), it seems that they know more than the average person about causes and possible medications to help, but really they are just guessing about what might work and what not and it's just process of elimition. It's frustrating.
0.500000	I do not like getting blood drawn, and I get scared to hear bad news.
0.142900	I don't really get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office.  I don't see a reason to get anxious or worried when in most cases the illness you have is just something simple or common.  Even if it is a rarer disease, it can usually be treated in some way.  
0.142900	I am healthy so going to a doctor's office does not make me anxious though when they take my blood pressure it is usually higher then normal. So subconsciously it may bother me a bit.
0.785700	I am an anxious person to begin with, so waiting in a public area with other people is already nerve wracking on it's own. I also have trouble talking with people I know well about my problems, so the idea of divulging intimate physical problems makes me very nervous.
0.619000	Of course I am concerned there may be some serious issue that I didn't know about. Everyone is a bit paranoid about their health and little pains or symptoms that they experience.
0.381000	I am mostly worried about the worst outcome. If I have a problem that I do not know what is going on, I am worried that the diagnosis will be poor and that could affect my lifespan or quality of life in general. I am also anxious when they lecture me about my health habits because I don't need a lecture as an adult, I understand my choices.
0.214300	I think most anxiety/worries just come from not knowing what is going to happen
0.547600	If anything has changed, if my health has worsened even though I feel okay. 
0.142900	As a healthy person i usually visit once a year for basic blood work
0.476200	I only feel anxious when I feel I have a problem that may require further visits. I have little or no anxiety with check ups or other tests. The only other times when I am anxious is when I have a problem so bad that it interferes with my life.
0.285700	I don't want to be diagnosed with a serious condition, I'm not anxious about seeing the doctor but the possibility that something is seriously wrong with my health
0.738100	I don't like the feeling of being exposed to strangers. I don't want to find out information that might make me change something drastic in my life.
1.000000	Another appointment with nothing getting done and feeling the same or worse when i leave the doctors office.   They said surgery wont help me but wont give me anything that helps make me comfortable.  
0.666700	Just that he might find something terribly wrong, or he missed something on a previous exam. Or something small that I don't think about turns out to be very important. Like a small pain or something that I don't think about turns out to be a symptom of something worse.
0.476200	The lighting in most of the doctor's offices seem to mess with my anxiety. I don't care to sit in those rooms waiting on the doctor. Depending what I am going for I may get nervous of the results. 
0.523800	Worrying about blood results coming back
0.595200	I'm always concerned that there might be some hidden condition that I am uware of that the doctor will find on a visit. I also dislike any sort of pain or discomfort during an examition. The worst part for me is waiting alone in the exam room before he comes in - my imagition is working overtime at that point.
0.238100	If my condition or the doctor find something that turns out to be worst than it really is. Or the doctor find something that's too late to be treated.
0.523800	I feel worried and anxious that the doctor won't listen to my concerns and will dismiss me.  Instead of providing me with a solution, they just tell me there is nothing they can do to help me.
0.857100	I guess it would be the waiting game. Waiting to get the test, then waiting for the results, waiting for the call that everything is fine, you hope and pray. 
0.381000	nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when going to the doctor i am just turally that way. it isnt being there that is causing the feelings its just life in general
0.738100	Pain.  But also, I know that I need to lose a few pounds.  I exercise regularly and am not dropping any weight.  I know I'm going to be scolded for it.
1.000000	i HATE going to the doctor and hospitals. i was in and out of them nonstop as a kid with very serious health problems.
0.285700	that I might get some disease or virus from the patients in the waiting room or from surfaces in the doctor's office. He also always shakes my hand. 
0.857100	I'm worried they won't listen to me. I'm worried I will encounter yet another doctor who does not care at all. I feel mistrustful after previous experiences.
0.190500	I don't have any worry when I go to the doctor's office in regards to my health. I currently do not have insurance so what would make me most anxious is I have something wrong that requires a lot of medical attention.
0.619000	alway the unknown. with you yearly exams.
0.190500	Just the waiting in the office to be seen and hearing everyone else cough and sneeze makes me anxious
0.142900	I feel most anxious when I see a doctor for pain or strange symptoms. I get worried that something is really wrong with me.
0.142900	Hearing bad news.
0.571400	I'm occasiolly worried about what I will be diagnosed with.
0.595200	Only that they might find something I'm not aware of. I am almost 60 so anything could go wrong. 
0.428600	Just the visit itself.  I can't really put my finger on what exactly it is.  I just don't like being there.  I don't like when they come in and talk to you like you;re friends.  We;re not, lets just get this medical stuff over with.
1.000000	In my dad's side of the family (possibly mom's too), we all have fear of doctors. I worry that the doctor will find something really wrong with me that nobody can fix. I'd rather live my life happily not knowing instead of dreading what I could possibly have.
0.142900	What makes me feel most anxious is just the interaction with the doctor.  I respect his opinion.
0.619000	I don't like feeling exposed when undressed. I am nervous about the tests.
0.309500	I am most worried the doctor may come across a condition I was uware of, and that requires lots of treatment
0.285700	I would only feel anxious if I had grave physical symptoms.
0.714300	I am turally an anxious person, but when I visit my doctor I'm paranoid he's going to find something that I didn't know was wrong with me. I think this is tural.
0.452400	The bill, for one. I can self diagnose online for free. We only go to the doctor to get pills for a condition we didn't know we had. I would rather die a horrible cancerous death than bother going on chemo or any BS like that. There are numerous altertive medicines out there that can literally cure this, but since big pharma says no, doctors won't acknowledge it. That's where the mistrust and anxiety comes in.
0.619000	I am worried something serious will be wrong with my health.
0.285700	Having little time with him because he stays busy all day, so I worry I may not get the time I need to talk about what is happening with me. 
0.142900	I don't want to hear any bad news about my health.
0.833300	I am worried that they will find out I have some horrible disease, or they will give me a medication that causes bad side effects.  I also worry about how much my medical treatments will cost.
0.761900	I think it's just fear of the unknown. I wonder whether I've developed some type of illness since my last visit, and let that fear take me to some dark places.
0.142900	I worry that they'll find something very wrong with me. Such as cancer or something
0.142900	I don't. I'm always calm when i visit my Dr
0.523800	The fear that soemthing worse might be wrong with me then initially thought. That uncertainty can make me very uncomfortable.
0.690500	I'm mostly worried about not asking the right questions while I am there. I'm not usually sure what I need to be asking. I then worry about whether  I'll be able to understand all the information that is going to be thrown at me. I'm just hoping it sticks so I can move on with my life as comfortably as possible. 
0.214300	Just the wait and time it takes to get through everything.
0.690500	The thing that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility that I could have a health problem. This makes me anxious because even when you live a healthy lifestyle, you can randomly get health problems. So it is this dread of the unknown that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office. 
0.571400	to hear some bad news about my health
1.000000	I have been sick most of my life. My anxiety is spiked when I have to deal with a new nurse, or sometimes the regular Dr is not in when I go to my appt, I prefer just my primary care provider. I do not trust the others very much.
0.547600	I've always been afraid of needles and visiting the doctor, but I have become better about this as I get older. Sometimes I worry that she will find something wrong that will require daily medication or some other more aggressive treatment.
0.690500	I fear physical aging of the body such as joint pain and also breast cancer, which my mother passed from.
0.404800	The waiting in a close small space, although I am not claustrophobic.  
0.738100	At one point I was having severe stomach and abdomil pain.  I went to the doctors believing that my appendix may have ruptured.  The dr did the necessary test to determine that was not the case and it was just a serve case of acid and the proper form of treatment to releave the symptoms
0.142900	Nothing.
0.261900	They always seem to find something wrong with me.  I am waiting for the cancer word to come up because I tend to have everything.
0.476200	the fear of the unknown, especially at my age, is what makes me worried.  Everyone has the fear of cancer.
0.214300	That I'm going to have an underlying problem that is going to be a long-term health ailment. My biggest fear is that I go in for one problem, but my Dr. discovers something more horrendous. 
0.690500	I always am worried about what is going on with me or if she will find something out that I don't know about.  I feel horribel getting on the scale and am embarrassed 
0.404800	The fear that you have something worse than what you really have.
0.357100	I usually feel anxious when waiting for the results of tests
0.166700	I have no this filling when visiting the doctor's office. I'm confident in my doctor.
0.381000	The one thing that makes me feel even slightly anxious is the idea that I somehow may have contracted some sort of disease that I would have not noticed without going to the doctor.
0.785700	cause i know he doesn't care.  i think i have white coat syndrome too where i get nervous...especially with the new doctor.  He knows nothing about me.  So i just don't go to the doctor.  I've had a cold for 3 weeks and won't go.
0.523800	I just don't like going. It's a fear of the unkown, and not wanting there to be anything bad wrong.
0.619000	My family has a lot of health problems. While I have been relatively healthy for my whole life so far, things could change at any time. I get nervous that I won't have my health in a future situation, so I try to do everything I can to stay healthy so I can live an active life. 
0.571400	Finding out that I have something more serious than I thought I did in the first place. Generally I only got when I am very sick.
0.642900	After having some tests done, I'm always fearful while waiting for the results.  She will usually tell me what to expect, but I worry about everything. 
0.428600	I get worried when I go to doctors when they give me results of blood work or tests.
0.738100	I am worried that my doctor will tell me I have a disease or that I am overweight. Or he'll tell me that I need to start eating better.
0.666700	I am worried that the diagnosis would be something completely different from what I expected it to be. I am worried that something may be more serious than it seems. 
0.785700	I hate needles I hate the blood pressure machine my health is reasobly good it's just I don't like being poked and prodded
0.214300	Simply not knowing the outcome is what would bother me.  Most of the time it is nothing, but the fact that it could be something serious makes me a little anxious from time to time.
0.738100	I never know what could be wrong with me.  I'm most worried about not knowing what the procedure might entail, if anything will hurt, and if a new condition will be discovered.
0.166700	The wait time.
0.452400	I just don't enjoy being poked and prodded by other people. I also have received some unfortute medical diagnoses (melanoma twice) in the last year, so it makes me a little worried that it will come back. 
0.595200	When I visit the doctors office it is usually for a reason, and I am worried that it will be a larger health concern than I would like to have. For example, I worry that the bump on my ear must be removed by surgery and thinking about hearing that makes me anxious. 
0.523800	I am always worried that they will tell me something is wrong.  Going to the doctor gives me general anxiety.
0.309500	That they will find something unexpected that is detrimental to my health.
0.714300	Not knowing what the outcome will be. I'm not a hypochondriac per se, but I do tend to think the worst thing whenever something is wrong with me physically. I dread getting a bad diagnosis but usually it's not that bad and can be easily fixed.
0.428600	Without a doubt, giving blood or receive a vaccition such as a flu shot. I really don't like needles:)
0.381000	What makes me most anxious is just being around people, and having the environment be chaotic and loud. 
1.000000	"I basically have ""white coat"" syndrome. Everything about a doctors office scares me. It just makes me feel like I am in danger even though nothing is wrong."
0.285700	The expentancy of news, the fear of having a desease or having something wrong with me without a cure. 
0.333300	The unknown or possible conditions that could be found. 
0.571400	them tell me something bad 
0.619000	the uncertainty of whats wrong with me, and if they can fix it and HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
0.690500	If he's going to find something wrong with me
0.523800	I worry about not making the appointment on time. I have to take the bus and make at least one transfer so there is a question of missing the appointment.
0.357100	I feel in many cases that the answers I get are just stock answers. No thinking out of the box. I would have zero issues if my doctor asked me to exercise or eat better for 2 weeks and then come back as a suggestion. Instead, it feels like receiving a pill is what I usually get. That is when I feel anxious of what just happened and worried that I won't get better. 
0.500000	I feel worried that I will not be able to describe the problems that I am having because I don't remember things about them, like how often they occur and for how long. I feel worried that I will be told I am unhealthy and that will mean that I am lazy. I feel worried that if I let on about the stress in my life, I will be referred into therapy I do not want and my parents will make a big deal of it.
0.309500	I get most anxious about the bill I receive after the visit. 
0.142900	I am always calm in the Dr's office.  I don't worry until there is something to worry about.
0.595200	I feel worried that something is going to turn out more negative than I expect. That the doctor will find something wrong that I wasn't expecting or give me bad news.
0.309500	Not much, usually. If I have to discuss an embarrassing issue I could be nervous, maybe. 
0.690500	Will I need any bloodwork done? Will I have to fight them to convince them to change my birth control or acknowledge my bi-annual sinus infections that I've gotten like clockwork since I was 16? 
0.452400	I am worried that I won't be able to get my prescription any more.
0.666700	treated me as if I were a number would not listen to my needs for anitboitics insisted on new meds that are not time tested and proved
0.285700	Potential health issues.
0.690500	I just feel like the doctor might not take my opionions seriously and maybe rude to me. I also fear there maybe something seriously wrong.
0.428600	how much the price of meds will be
0.619000	Sometimes I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me that I don't know about yet. 
0.666700	I'm nervous to begin with and do not like going to doctors to begin with and then you add the added anxiety of them finding something wrong, so yes I do feel anxiety going to the doctor for a couple reasons.
0.738100	I feel this way because I do not know what the doctor is going to respond with after he alyzes my condition.  I am then feeling stressed because I will ultimately have to sift through the facts and determine how I want to proceed.  I get worried because I am afraid the doctor is going to provide a misdiagnosis or find something else wrong I may not have needed to know about at the time.
0.595200	I just feel worried that they don't have my best interest at heart. They just want to line their own pockets. They also don't spend much time explaining things or giving altertives.
0.261900	If I have an ailment, I'm most worried about how much time and cost I will have to dedicate to having it treated.
0.571400	I get worried that something may be wrong and I don't know it.
0.333300	I only get anxious when I visit the doctor when I think there is something wrong with me that I am not sure about. I Google my symptoms and start to get even more worried before I even see the doctor. I am worried about what the doctor may say and I fear the worst. 
0.142900	When I have something wrong and the doctor takes a long time to figure out what it is. Though I suppose the worst is worrying about the cost of the procedure.
0.261900	"I always worry about getting that ""I don't know what's causing your problems"" answer - or worse yet, the clear implication that it's ""all in my head."" I fear the doctor won't find anything, when I absolutely know that something is wrong."
0.738100	You never know what they are going to find.  Even if you feel totally healthy they could tell you something is wrong.  That is what makes me feel anxious.
0.666700	The fear that something might be wrong.
0.738100	that he will find something that is untreatable.
0.904800	It's just uncomfortable having your body examined by a stranger. Waiting in the room, sometimes half ked, is really not my idea of fun. I am afraid of being judged by the doctor or afraid of finding out some sort of bad news about my health.
0.333300	I feel most anxious when I'm going to have to have blood drawn. I have a thyroid disorder, so it's fairly often so they can check my TSH. I don't like needles and I am a lot better than I used to be, but I always get a little nervous about the stick.
0.881000	I am incredibly anxious to begin with and I'm not a huge fan of going to the doctors. I hate the unknown, but I hate bad news even more. I also get scared of being judged by the doctors and nurses. 
0.261900	Hoping the report will turn out fine as usual
0.571400	He telling me that something is wrong with my results.
0.500000	I worry that I am going to receive news that I have a physical illness that went undetected before. I'm worried that I might have cancer, diabetes, or heart issues. I am obese, so my weight is of great concern. 
0.523800	I am usually worried that my blood pressure will be high. The anxiety ends up making my blood pressure high. It is sort of a cycle. 
0.738100	I often feel anxious or worried about them always wanting to discuss my weight. Not my problem the reason I am there. They are always trying to blame me being overweight a little.
0.714300	I am not a huge fan of going to the doctor but still go because I value my health. I am always a little apprehensive of visiting the doctor even though I am in excellent health.
0.309500	Just the possibility of things that could go wrong. Things could always go awry. The doctor could always find something that you did not know you had going on.
0.142900	I get a little anxious if I have to wait awhile for my physician. Sometimes I'm worried if something new is bothering me and finding out what it is. 
0.547600	The fact of what could be wrong makes me anxious.  I don't know if I have an issue that will require further medical attention.
0.642900	Normally it's a matter of having to wait to hear back from them that makes me anxious. I dislike waiting for exams and tests to come back. 
0.833300	I don't like feeling vulnerable as someone exams me.  I don't like having to get undressed in a cold room or having someone judging me.  If I do go to the doctor, I normally have to have something seriously wrong so I am anxious to find out what the problem is.  
0.785700	I get anxious going to the doctor because I don't know what they will say or have me do, and I don't know if I will be able to explain my problem well enough for them to understand.
0.547600	i just do not like being touched by people i am not close with. i also hate waiting to see if something is wrong with me
0.666700	I'm always afraid that he will find something knowing that I'm not a spring chicken.
0.142900	I never feel anxious when I visit the doctor. The few times in my life when I did it was only because I thought the illness I was experiencing might be indicative of something very serious. I was worried about the diagnosis but not the doctor.
0.476200	When I am there for symptoms. Also the anxious feeling is there because no one taught me how to go to doctors and make appointments for myself.
0.666700	When visiting the doctor , I sometimes feel anxious because of the unknown. You never know what a doctor is going to tell you. If something is wrong , I always have the feeling it will be something horrible...
0.642900	I worry the the doctor might find a serious issue that will negatively affect my life. I also sometimes worry that the doctor will not be able to diagnose me properly and I might have to go to another physician.
0.785700	I always fear a negative diagnosis such as a termil disease or serious debilitating condition.  Some of the tests are not fun either.  Such as blood tests.  
0.500000	I am always worried they will find something serious like they did with my mother's cancer.
0.547600	How long the affair is going to take. How poor the doctor's bedside manner is going to be. How much of my problem's they'll casually write off as being about my weight and nothing more. Whether or not they'll believe me about problems I'm having.
0.619000	There is always the concern that you might have some serious health issue that you didn't spot and that a doctor may notice. I also am not a fan of being touched by those I'm not close with so I get a bit anxious due ot the amount of physical contact involved in most appointments.
0.714300	I just hate being examined and having to visit the doctor in general. Life would be easier without having yearly exams to have to go to. :)
0.690500	I feel anxious looking at the different types of instruments.
0.452400	I'm a turally anxious person. I think I go into the doctor's office with the fear that something is wrong, so I'm worried that I'll be right in that assumption. I'm nervous that I'll be scolded for not being perfect.
0.119000	nothing really. it is what it is nothing to be concerned about. 
0.309500	if it isn't something that is easily diagnosed then there would be cause for concern. most of the time it's a cold or a cough so not anxious usually.,
0.142900	I am not usually those things unless there is a really big issue. 
0.642900	I get uncomfortable if any clothing removal is involved. Also, I get a little nervous that something might hurt. I also get nervous that something is wrong and it won't get noticed.
0.333300	That they will misdiagnose or miss something completely, or not even pay attention to what I'm saying.
0.571400	The thought that something completely insane might be discover like cancer
0.142900	Not knowing what is wrong with me and hoping that it isn't the worst case scerio.
0.428600	I usually feel most anxious when I am waiting, waiting to be brought back to the exam and waiting to see the doctor. I also get anxious when I feel sick and don't know what's wrong with me, the unknown makes me worried.
0.404800	The reason I feel anxious or worried while visiting the doctors is because I generally only go if I am having problems so I'm turn I usually am thinking the worst diagnosis possible. 
0.619000	I am worried that something will be wrong with me. That, or I worry that the doctor may judge me. I'm worried he might think I'm lazy, gross, or don't take catre of myself.
0.214300	The fear that a serious condition could be found. It's really the noting of mortality, that something with the body could be malfunctioning.

0.809500	I feel anxious because I always feel like he is going to find something wrong with me.
0.190500	The only time I have ever been anxious when seeing a doctor was when I was pregnt. I would be worried they would find something wrong with the baby.

0.619000	I'm always worried that he may find something terribly wrong with me. I'm always worried about cancer.

0.381000	Just the general routine of having the physical and examition because it's such a persol matter.
0.761900	I'm always afraid that something serious will come up that I was uware of.
0.571400	idk
0.238100	They might find something seriously wrong.
0.761900	I dealt with some health issues in the past. So it makes me anxious when I am visiting a doctor for a problem I think I may have. Mostly I am anxious that they will tell me I do in fact have this problem but I am also hopeful that I will not have health issues
0.214300	nothing really
0.666700	If the doctor seems preoccupied or spends little time with me and leaves my care in the hands of his nurse, that concerns me.  When his staff makes a mistake, that worries me.
0.809500	I get worried that something may be getting worse like my blood pressure or my blood sugar levels and that I will have to deal with new medical problems.
0.619000	I feel anxious when the doctor makes me uncomfortable or talks down to me. Additiolly, if the nurses or front desk staff are rude when I walk in, I start to feel uneasy.

0.142900	"I'm not anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, at all. There isn't a need to be. It's not as if I ""must"" by some law follow what they ask me to do, it's merely a choice. I'd be far more worried to visit a dentist and worry about needing a cavity filled then seeing a doctor. "
0.523800	The doctor may find something wrong that I didn't expect. I feel like I am in good health and don't like to find out there is something wrong that I didn't know about.
0.142900	I really don't think like there's anything, since her and her office folks make me feel completely at ease. Possibly what my blood pressure is going to be.
0.881000	I worry that my blood pressure will be high. I worry about being diagnosed with cancer. I'm 66 and feel my mortality.
0.547600	Worried that it could be something serious, or even termil.
0.714300	I feel anxious because even though I know there is most likely a problem I hate to hear that I have a problem. It's an anxiety that I have always had before visiting a doctor or dentist.
0.619000	I hate shots, giving blood, etc., and will do anything I can to avoid them.  I wish there was a way for the doctor to put me more at ease.  I don't think it's her responsibility to do this, but I have had experiences where I felt much more at ease depending on the person when I've had to give blood.  
0.190500	That he may find something wrong. Even though it would perhaps be able to get better, sometimes ignorance is bliss.
0.690500	I always get nervous about having blood drawn.  Even though it's not that painful, I still dread the puncture.
0.142900	I don't generally go to the doctor's office very much except for a routine check up.

0.190500	I feel worried about my possible diagnosis. I worry that I might get sick more than I really am. I know my doctor will help me, but if I catch something bad, there's only so much she can do.
0.952400	"They're going to want to order more tests ""just to be sure"" so that our understanding goes from 90% likely to 92% likely, but these new tests are going to cost me enough to take years to pay off."
0.214300	If I'm going in for something unknown, I might feel a bit anxious.  Other than that, it's routine body maintence.
0.690500	Something might come up. Maybe it will be caught early, or maybe something terrible will be detected like cancer.
0.500000	"Waiting in the office after my vitals are taken and before the doctor comes in.  Also waiting for test results - anxious about the ""what ifs""."
0.428600	I really don't suffer from anxiety at all when visiting the doctor. Potentially missing work is the only thing that worries me.
0.785700	If I am going in about a problem I am worried about what he tells me is wrong with me. I am worried that it will be something serious that would require more medical attention from a professiol.
0.976200	I am always concerned that something will be wrong with me. I have and still do drink heavily. I am scared that one day something concerning those risks taken will be serious. 
0.523800	I feel anxious or worried that something more serious may be wrong than is really the case. I also become anxious about the possibility of having to get any additiol tests given to me because often times my doctor's office is not very quick about getting results to me, so I will wait and worry about test results. 
0.261900	Its the waiting in a crowded room.
0.523800	I worry about being lectured about my health and also having to go through the whole procedure of tests. I don't like it.
0.714300	That a problem will be discovered

0.738100	I feel anxious because i sometimes think i will be diagnosed with a terrible disease.
0.881000	I am worried about having to get ked. I am worried about finding out something is wrong with me. I am nervous about having to talk to a stranger about persol issues.
0.261900	The waiting while in an office that smells of sickness. If it wasn't for the smell it wouldn't be so bad but they always smell.
0.571400	I am working hard to improve my health and I always get worried that my tests will show that I have regressed in my work.  I also worry that at some point it may come back and tell me that I have developed a serious health issue that will require lifestyle changes.
0.738100	The man barely looks me in the eye. He's very brusque. 
0.571400	Doctors usually are hurried and that makes me anxious. I usually have questions and I'm worried that I won't have time to ask them. Or I worry about whether the doctor will listen to me and help me. I have been dismissed so often by doctors, especially for my children. 
0.595200	Them finding something wrong with me that isn't easy to fix.
0.142900	Getting sick from other patients. 
0.500000	Needles primarily, but once it happens it isn't htat bad. It's the anticipation that bothers me.
0.690500	Everything about going to the doctor gives me anxiety. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, so it can not really be helped. I am concerned that I will only hear bad news, or that the doctor will be cold and judgemental, or any other number of things that could be negative about the experience. 
0.619000	What they may find or tell me what is wrong.
0.142900	I don't usually feel anxious or worried about going to my doctor. If there are problems, then I will deal with them when they arise. Only time I'm a bit apprehensive is if I need to see a new doctor.
0.142900	That I'll have a super long wait. I really don't get nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.642900	I get irratiol fears that my ear infection will somehow end up being cancer. This is the mindset I normally have when I visit the doctors so I normally have a healthy amount of anxiety when I have to go in.
0.595200	Honestly, just the thought of having to go into the office and waiting. I have gotten to the point in my life now where I freely discuss health issues and concerns. 
0.642900	I am most worried about the doctor telling me that something is wrong (like finding a lump) and that farther testing will be required. Some things cant be found or will go unnoticed until you visit a doctor, and I am most scared about some illness creeping up on me.
0.214300	I, like most people, have a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. This stems purely from not knowing if something is wrong with me that I might not have noticed. I stay in shape, and have a healthy routine, but there is always the chance that something is lurking underneath. 
0.119000	I honestly have no anxiety when meeting with my doctor. I enjoy the process. 
0.547600	Am I going to have the issue addressed or will I have it out aside again.
0.285700	I guess it's all the waiting. There is always at least a 10-15 minute wait in the office before the appointment. 5-10 would be more acceptable. Then there is also the time you have to wait in the examition room. 
0.666700	Probably that they will find something horrible. They are going to tell me i'm to fat and to quit smoking. Both are easy to say but hard to do.
0.142900	I'm more anxious to see if the thoughts I have on what the issue are line up to his. If they do then I already kind of know the course of treatment so there is no mystery.
0.642900	Even if I feel healthy, I get worried that there is something wrong. Also, I don't visit the doctor often so I get anxious about being in an unfamiliar place. Since it is so far between times I visit a doctor I get worried that I waited too long for them to diagnose.
0.190500	I'm worried that I may have a hidden condition of some sort. I generally feel healthy, but there is also a small thought in the back of my head that I may have hidden, lingering cancer or something. I don't want to get bad news. 
0.690500	Finding out that I might have a chronic disease.
0.357100	It's not so much the doctor visit that concerns me.  It's the lab results.  As I am under aggressive treatments for my Cancer, my lab numbers fluctuate with various modalities and medications and that gives me modest concern.
0.666700	I often worry that results from an exam or test will point to a disease or condition such as cancer. When I wait to hear back via email from a doctor regarding test results, it is often a tense and worrisome time. 
0.452400	I mostly just get worried that I will have some unforeseen symptom that they notice that could mean something bad. I also get worried I will need a shot that day.
0.285700	Nothing much really....
0.476200	Typically I am just worried something will come up during the exam. My doctor is capable of making me feel better. The diagnosis of things is typically explained properly as well with little questions from me.
0.809500	The fact that I would ever be in a position to where I would have to visit a doctor for anything.
0.785700	I worry about being judged or put down again. I worry that there will be something terribly wrong with me and the dr will miss it or dismiss me based on my appearance.
0.809500	I don't want to hear any bad news.  I just want to hear that all is well and I can go about my life.  I do not want to hear that something is worrisome and I need more tests, etc.
0.761900	Worried that I get diagnosed with a serious illness.
0.142900	In the past I had struggled with Anxiety and Depression. I do not currently struggle with these issues and they have since been resolved. Due to the ture and cultural stigma relating to mental health it was somewhat difficult for me to deliver my concerns verbally to my doctor. This made me feel very anxious and worried before my appointment, but once I filly maged to communicate my concerns I was put at ease by my doctors professiolism and demeanor regarding the issues. He helped a great deal my overcoming this medical condition and now I no longer have these issues and no longer need medication for this.
0.881000	How much my insurance will cover.  If the doctor will tell me something I don't want to know.  If they are going to treat me with respect and give me the time that I need.
0.285700	Nothing about going to the doctor makes me feel this way.  Usually I feel annoyed because of the kids, the waiting, and the cost.
0.714300	I have a severe case of white coat syndrome. As soon as I walk into the office I start sweating profusely. Strange because I am a doctor...
0.381000	I'm getting older, and I know I'm not as strict with myself about maintaining proper diet and exercise.  I know it's for my own good, but visiting my doctor means confronting my own shortcomings in this area.
0.666700	That they will push needless meds and tests and not do anything for me anyway. Doctor is no longer a noble profession
0.714300	If I have a health problem I usually get anxious over whether the doctor will be able to help me or not. I get worried about what tests or procedures might be necessary and whether any serious diseases might be discovered.
0.357100	There's a lot that I don't know when I go into a doctor's office, and I'm often concerned that I'm forgetting to say something that is relevant to my health. I don't know what is and isn't necessary to know, and the whole experience makes me aware of my own frailty and mortality in a way I usually am not.
0.714300	Health problems for me tend to get found when things go wrong. I have had serious health problems. Ever examition feels like it could lead to a new treatment, a new bill, a new health concern. 
0.738100	I am always afraid even if i  am doing  everything right that I'm going in and they are going to tell me bad news. I have what they call white coat syndrome and it makes me feel bad. 
0.666700	when i am experiencing a medical problem I sometimes have anxiety about it. The unknown makes me anxious 
0.928600	I worry about getting bad news. I worry about being judged. I worry about appearing nervous and anxious.
0.833300	When I visit a doctor's office I am always anxious because I don't know what he is going to find. I am always worried about my physical health.
0.690500	I always worry that the doctor I'm seeing won't be attentive to my needs. I have encountered several doctors that seem to have a script that they recite, no matter what ailment I'm being seen for. I worry that the visit will not accomplish anything, and it makes me feel quite helpless.
0.595200	I am afraid of the procedures that cause pain.Also finding something is wrong with me is scary.
0.238100	What makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility of receiving really bad news whether it pertains to me or my children. This holds especially true every time my daughter has a checkup or when my wife and I had our hearts looked at to ensure we didn't have any issues go unnoticed for the majority of our lives.
0.428600	I tend to feel anxious whenever there strangers involved, especially professiols. I tend to be anxious all the time, especially when outside of places I'm comfortable with or familiar with, and a doctor's office is the furthest thing from a comfortable space to be in. That, and I'm always paranoid that I might unintentiolly make it more difficult for the doctor to actually do their job. I tend to breathe very differently, almost as if I'm trying to keep myself from showing any potential symptoms. Plus, my self-destructive tendencies (that are caused by my depression) tend to come in the form of me denying myself help, so even I mage to get to a doctor, I feel cornered. 
0.976200	Just nervous being at the doctor's office, I have anxiety every time even when it's just a simple check-up. Mainly the uncertainty.
0.166700	The thing that I experience the most anxiety from is the fact that there are other people at the office. I always have anxiety when being in the same room as multiple people. However, one on ones with the doctor or nurse doesn't bother me at all.
0.642900	Recieving bad news. Getting a wrong diagnosis.
0.785700	The fear that something adverse may be discovered. Also the existential feeling of a lack of control over a possible health issue.
0.809500	Normally I am concerned, like most, that my doctor could find something seriously wrong with me. My mother passed of lupus, and my father just recovered from colon cancer, so I am concerned that it's only a matter of time that I am diagnosed with a life threatening aliment. 
0.357100	I'm usually worried they won't believe me about whatever problem I'm having. I've had this happen multiple times, and both issues turned out being detectable, serious ones even though the first doctor didn't believe me.
0.238100	I have COPD. Each time I visit my doctor I half expect him to tell me my symptoms are getting worse and that the end is near.
0.714300	I almost always feel skeptical that I will get any good answers and it makes me feel worried that I will never find an answer.
0.714300	I lost trust , because i want doctors to tell the truth if they are not aware of some type of medical problem before, rather than using someone as a guinea pig for their experiment.
0.690500	Thinking that you have some major disease. 
0.452400	If my blood pressure it too high, or my weight is too high.  I work out every day and I've been a healthy eater my whole life, so when my weight goes up, I get pretty upset because I feel like there's no reason for it.
0.142900	Probably just the blood tests I have to take.  They changed people and the new people aren't very good at making it quick and painless.
0.642900	I have a touch of health anxiety, so I tend to expect the worst. Even if my symptoms are fairly benign, my imagition gets the best of me.
0.595200	I always fear the worst. I think I'm going to end up getting something really bad and those thoughts run through my mind while im in the office.
1.000000	They want to make a healthy person sick by prescribing unnecessary tests and procedures to charge a huge bill, also lacking skills and giving incorrect diagnosis.
0.452400	I feel most anxious before the uncertainty of answers. I understand trained medical professiols are not supposed to let on emotiolly about the prognosis/diagnosis of a patient. Still, I rely on the small nuances in their expression or tone, body language, etc. to gauge the real severity of the situation.
0.595200	there's always something in the back of your mind telling you it's worse than it is. Fortutely, it usually isn't.
0.952400	When I visit the doctor, I'm afraid that I am going to be very sick. This feeling comes even if I've had no symptoms or other serious illness
0.714300	I just want answers, which is something I can never get. I really don't even care if the answers are not good, I just want some answers, that's all.
0.738100	I am worried if anything would be wrong. I'm worried what my doctor will think about me. 
0.714300	I ALWAYS KNOW THE ISSUE ABOUT MY WEIGHT IS GOING TO COME UP.  I HATE TALKING ABOUT IT.  I HAVE TRIED AND FAILED MANY TIMES TO LOSE WEIGHT.  I ALSO NOTICE MORE PAINS THAN USUAL AND WORRY KNOWING MY FAMILY HISTORY.
0.285700	I am not anxious or worried at all when I visit the doctor's office. There is not point in it. If something is wrong then worrying about it isn't going to help the situation get any better.
0.309500	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fact that I always have to wait so long before seeing him.  Sometimes I might be in the waiting room for hours.
0.238100	When I do not know what is wrong with me.
0.214300	In case I am feeling bad about something that I think is the worst case scerio and I will not find out until he has examined me or ran some tests. Worrying is mostly in my head and not a result of the doctor himself.
0.904800	I never look forward to seeing what it says on the scale, to start. Then the pressure I feel about the decisions I make about my own health seem to come under scrutiny and that makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't wait to be done with the appointment.
0.642900	I don't feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. I usually feel relieved that something that is going on is going to get taken care of here. I don't like to go to the doctor but I feel better once I know what is going on with my health than not knowing. 
0.785700	Going to the doctor makes me uneasy because it's so persol and I'm concerned there may be something more serious happening.
0.523800	I only get nervous about a bad diagnosis.
0.142900	The most worrisome thought would be they're going to find out some things wrong that can't be fixed. I mean if you find out you have to take medicine or have a light surgery it's fine. You go there and they tell you that you have cancer, or heart failure all because you went there because you had a slight cough and are slightly fatigued..... I mean who expects that to happen?
0.500000	Not knowing what they're going to tell me or what test they're going to pressure me into taking, which will cost me extra money.
0.642900	I think just the thought of them finding something  wrong is why i get really worried , 
0.142900	I can't. I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I feel calm and indifferent, and a bit bored.
0.833300	Feeling embarrassed by something that is going on with me I guess. I think I am more anxious about that than anything else. My health is pretty good, and if it wasn't I don't think I'd really fear that. The money, also, the money makes me extremely worried. I fear having to pay thousands of dollars for my health.  
0.690500	I am always afraid that they are going to find something seriously wrong that I am not aware of.
0.666700	I always expect a clean bill of health but I get anxious and worry that they will find something wrong with me and that is why i do not like to go. Id rather not know
0.547600	My anxiety stems from uncertainty. Each time I go to the doctor for a physical exam, I have to do blood work. Even though I am relatively healthy, I do not know what that blood work would come back saying. This has little to do with my doctor and more to do with just the uncertainty of the human body. 
0.523800	I just worry sometimes that they might find something that I already didn't know about.  I don't like to be surprised usually.  Especially when it comes to my own body and health.
0.523800	I'm little bit afraid of bad news.
0.476200	That my doctor will find a new problem with me. That I have a new bacteria or that I have a big problem;
0.523800	What makes me feel most anxious/worried about when I visit a doctor's office is finding out if something could possibly be wrong with me.
0.428600	I'm getting ked in front of a mostly complete stranger who is poking and prodding me, literally looking for things that are wrong...
0.404800	I seldom feel it. Maybe because the doctor is gorgeous or maybe If I'm afraid to find out that something bad is happening to me which I'm very thankful that it hasn't happen to me yet.
0.809500	Just the overall experience. You never know what to expect or what they could find that isn't necessarily good.
0.166700	I rarely get anxious at the doctors office.  If I go to the doctor when I feel like something may be wrong, then I may be anxious until I know that it is not something serious.
0.166700	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is if he finds something to be concerned about.
0.738100	I fear that they are going to find something really serious is wrong with me. 
0.642900	Getting my blood pressure taken and going on the scale to measure my weight. Two things I dont think many people like doing.
0.547600	I just do not like the whole experience, or the sterile smell of the health care faculties. 
0.452400	I am not sure what the outcome will be. Is he going to give me any news I may not want to hear.
0.833300	I am most anxious and worried when I visit a doctor's office because I feel like doctors only look at the major illnesses that you may have instead of realizing that everyone doesn't fit into those categories.
0.285700	If I have been very ill for a long time and there has been nothing to help me for a long time, I would worry wondering if the test results would show some dangerous illness like cancer, aids, etc. which could kill me soon.
1.000000	When I had to go in for a CT scan of my head after a surgery (I moved shortly after this surgery so this hospital was new), the doctors started freaking out because there was a significant amount of blood around my brain, which we knew about after my surgery. They however didn't and they admitted me and were contemplating doing emergency surgery even though I wasn't displaying any alarming symptoms like I should have. Long story short, that even made me terrified of going to the doctor, because being hospitalized that rapidly even though I felt fine was really disturbing, and to think that if things didn't work out for me, I could have never seen the outside world again just like that. 
0.428600	Being in a doctor's office makes me feel anxious because I am vulnerable and surrounded by people I do not know. That is an uncomfortable situation for me. 
0.595200	them telling me something that I don't want to hear
0.523800	I have no problem with being in a doctor's office since I used to work in one. But, I do hate when they take my vitals then have me sit for a half hour before doing their quick 5 minute check up. 
0.523800	That I'll get sick from being around so many sick people.
0.142900	The only thing I get worried about is what my number on the scale will be. (weight)
0.761900	That I will receive bad news but mostly because of my social anxiety as soon as I come in I'm terrified. 
0.428600	I feel most anxious when I have something wrong with my health that I am worried about. 
0.619000	For my mother, any visit to the doctor's office is a possible event filled with dread. Has the cancer spread to her brain yet? How long will she be able to breathe effectively before the tumors in her lungs over power her? For myself? I'm basically as healthy as a horse and entirely apathetic about it.
0.238100	Not much really, unless I'm going there because I think there is really something wrong with me. Like finding a lump in my breast or something of that kind. But generally, I feel fine when I go there.
0.142900	When I am feeling ill and I don't have a good idea about what is wrong.
0.381000	I don't like to have closed contact with people in general. Visiting a doctor and having the doctor examine my body is uncomfortable for me. 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. 
0.142900	When I am going in with something that I dont know about and how it will turn out. I mostly go for my annual physicals. I never have ailments. So if I ever had an ailment and had to go in I would be very anxious.
0.642900	The fear of them finding something wrong with me.
0.285700	When my doctor is checking my weight I get worried because I am trying to lose weight to control my diabetes 
0.785700	I am most anxious or worried about receiving bad news or requiring a procedure that I'm not comfortable with.
0.166700	Just general anxiety because I've experienced a lot of incorrect diagnoses, and as a result, been prescribed medicine that has a very negative effect on me. I worry about not being listened to. I dread the patient blame that I've experienced.  
0.690500	Not sure what they will say. Sometimes they make me feel bad about myself.
0.500000	More so the results of testing or the results for why Im there.
0.523800	I get anxious when I visit the doctor's office because of the fear of what could be wrong. I think that it is deep rooted from the loss of my first born child.
0.285700	I am not at all anxious or worried about anything.  My doctor is just wonderful.  I go every six months.  I was just there, and he is a great doctor.
0.285700	I don't usually get anxious when I see my doctor.  I might get anxious if I see a new doctor b/c I don't know how he will treat me.
0.476200	I am always about any appoiment, every time I go se the doctor I just don't like to wait.
0.500000	That they won't know what's wrong, or that they won't take me seriously enough.
0.857100	I am just anxious and apprehensive when I go into new environments and have to deal with people that I don't know and situations that are uncertain, that includes doctor's offices.
0.142900	What makes mw feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office is finding out that there could be something seriously wrong with me and also having to get a shot or blood drawn.
0.238100	Sometimes I see the doctor for exams and they will draw blood so I feel a little anxious
0.642900	That they won't hear me. Or that I'll get some dreadful diagnosis and then be faced with decisions that I don't want to make.
0.404800	I worry that test results will come back showing something wrong. These worries are usually unfounded.
0.309500	I feel upset if I am being taken care of by a PA/NP instead of an MD. I am wary of their diagnosis or whether or not they are able to give a better assessment than the MD.
0.381000	I am most worried that my doctor will find a new problem or disease when I am examined. I don't want a new disease to deal with. I am also worried that I will lose my health insurance and I won't be able to afford treatment.
0.357100	Since I have a mental health issue on top of physical health issues, am always anxious that they will not take me seriously when I complain of some heart related issue (although I have a heart history).  Unfortutely, a mental health issue is rather like having a giant red mark following you around and often professiols have a hard time looking beyond that for another explation for a problem,
0.714300	I am an anxious person anyway. Going to the Dr is a very persol matter, which makes me nervous. You do not know what to expect.
0.285700	The bill. And if they can actually help
0.547600	I guess I worry first because it's full of sick people and the energy is negative. Anxiety about the future is also a general condition existent in all and a doctor's office is a good symbol for that. No one knows what the shadow knows.
0.214300	Probably the bill.
0.428600	I am an anxious person in general.  So after having waited in the waiting room, and then waiting again in the exam room as I wait for the doctor to come in I am already getting anxious and worked up.  It's not because I fear what I might learn or what might happen, but I'm just nervous in general about meeting the doctor and the waiting and anticipation helps fuel my nervousness.  I am far more nervous about meeting and talking to the doctor than I am about what might happen or what I might learn during my visit with the doctor.
0.142900	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting for the doctor is when he asks me very private information. I understand why since they are related to my health, but as a private person, it still makes me anxious/worried since I prefer those information to stay in my brain.
0.666700	Not knowing what's wrong with me.  Worrying that it's worse than it actually is.  The fear of not knowing whether or not they are able to help me.
0.833300	I would be most worried about being told I had a terrible disease. I would be andious about being told I needed urgent surgery. I would be worried about being told I needed to take manh drugs for the rest of my life.
0.619000	I am not a people person.  Even though I like my doctor, any time I have one-on-one with people that I do not deal with socially, I am uncomfortable to some degree.  I recognize this, and know that my doctor is there to help, but I am still anxious.  The waiting does not help.
0.404800	When they are in a bad mood. They have a facial expression of someone angry and mad at the world.
0.928600	I feel worried about what could be wrong. I rarely will see a doctor due to the fear that something major could be wrong medically. Also anxious due to feeling like the Dr does not want to be bothered with me as a patient.
0.238100	"When visiting the doctor, there's always a ""what if"".  I'm never scared or worried about my health, per se, but just if something is not feeling right or beginning to come on."
0.642900	I guess worried that the Doctor may find something wrong or more serious than I thought. The uncertainty of going to a doctors office brings about a tension and I know that elevates my blood pressure. Some times a problem might be embarrassing to talk about and that brings about a feeling of anxiety as well.
0.142900	I am only anxious if something might not be covered by my health insurance plan. My biggest worry is money.
0.595200	No one ever wants to hear bad news about their health and when you don't see a physician often, it's likely that there may be underlying issues you are not aware of.
0.142900	I don't usually feel worried or anxious when I go, I live a fairly healthy life and I feel healthy. On the rare occasions where I do feel anxious is when I hurt myself working out. I've sprained my ankle badly before and I felt anxiety cause I didn't know if I broke a bone or something more severe. So the anxiety stems from not knowing the severity of my injuries.
0.738100	Waiting for test results.
0.642900	I sometimes feel somewhat anxious or worried about my general health profile and whether or how much my health might be declining or how much I might be developing risk factors for future problems.
0.238100	Other people that are there that may be sick, and I end up catching what they have.
0.523800	I get worried I won't have the time to ask everything I need,  or that I put it off too long. 
0.309500	Just that I would rather be somewhere else.  I am usually OK, but there is always that thought that they might find something.  But then again, that is a good thing because then we can treat it.
0.404800	When I am there because I know something is wrong, i dislike the suspense of waiting.
0.333300	Contracting something from other sick people, or feeling vulnerable just being in the office when I don't really want to be there.
0.428600	"That there might be something wrong with me that I just didn't ""feel""."
0.690500	I don't like being poked and prodded while wearing a paper gown.
0.285700	there's the inevitable 'you need to be taking a statin' but that doesn't bother me much.  I know its coming, I know she's doing it because thats what the establishment teaches her to do.  my understanding of the issue, based on recent research, tells me different and the establishment it just lagging.
0.547600	The thought of having your blood drawn makes me cringe.
0.142900	When I have a problem and I work myself up by googling signs and symptoms which usually tends to point me towards the worst case scerio.  When i go to the doctor to confirm my conditions, I get anxious waiting to hear what I really have going on.
0.571400	If I already have a bad feeling before going to a doctor then I will be worried that they might confirm my suspicions.
0.452400	I worry about nearly everything, but that is one thing that I oddly don't general worry about.  I would say the only thing I might be slightly anxious about would be to find out I have something I didn't realize (tumor, heart condition, cancer), but that seldom crosses my mind.
0.666700	With some health care providers in the past, I felt that they were too rushed and a little rough. During my first pregncy, I saw one doctor in the practice who gave me a quick, rough interl exam. Even my husband was cringing. When a doctor's bedside manner is impersol and they seem rushed for time, it usually makes me feel nervous, and I am much less likely to ask questions, lest I annoy the doctor.
0.285700	I am anxious just because I do not want to get a bunch of drugs to take that are bad for me.
0.142900	"Nothing. I don't worry or get anxious. Worry is a waste of time. Mark Twain said ""I have worried about a lot of things in my life, and some of them actually happened.""  People need to relax. If anything, maybe the bill would worry me, or that a treatment needed would be way too expensive to get. "
0.619000	I just generally feel that I am worried to discover that something is wrong with me. If I am just there for a checkup, you never know what it is you are going to find out. Just the atmosphere of being around other suffering people makes me anxious.
0.142900	the results of whats wrong with me 
0.571400	I hate going at the doctor, maybe it's that sense of uncertainty that kills me.. I fear the physical pain but I can bear it well enough.
0.666700	I mostly feel anxious when I am at the doctor because I don't like needles or pain whatsoever. If I have to give blood or get an exam, I get so nervous because the pain makes me feel sick.
0.666700	The uncertainty of what may be found during the visit
0.476200	I'm not worried as much about the examition as I am about finding that there is something wrong with me. I always worry that I will have a bad disease or contract something that could be bad, even fatal for me.
0.904800	I just hate being out of my element and hate having people I don't know touch me
0.452400	My weight always makes me feel anxious and discouraged. Discussion around how much medication will cost makes me anxious. The wait in the waiting room usually makes me feel worried and irritated.
0.761900	Will I be helped or just shoved through the system?  We don't see doctors anymore unless we can pay their price to see them.  We see s now and while I'm sure they are very good I'd like to know why doctors are letting them take over when they went to school for.
0.857100	Getting some sty infectious disease or being given news about some complication with regards to my health. I really don't trust doctors or visiting them for any reason. I try to stay relatively healthy to avoid having to go to one.
0.571400	"I am always worries about getting ""grim news"" about a symptom I go see my doctor about.  I know being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness is rare, but I always feel I will be one of the unlucky ones who gets that bad news."
0.666700	I get anxious just being there. I am a person with high anxiety, so just being in the doctors office causes me as great deal of anxiety. I also get anxious that something will be wrong with me.
0.285700	When I go to the doctor's office for something serious - that isn't just a regular checkup - I'm more worried about what's wrong with me than what the doctor's gon do to me. I know my doctors aren't going to do anything weird, or try to make me take any weird medicine that doesn't actually work so that I'll just keep coming back to them. I feel like I can actually trust my doctors, even though I understand that not everyone feels that way with their own doctors.
0.142900	Getting weighed 
0.261900	That the examition/treatment might be painful (such as the time when I had an ingrown toeil remedied).
0.642900	I worry about what could be wrong with me.  It's not the doctor that makes me nervous. It's dealing with sickness.
0.690500	I feel most anxious or worried when it comes to what the doctor might tell me is wrong with me. When I am waiting to see the doctor, my mind starts to race with negative thoughts. While I understand the doctor is there to help, I would usually not be seeing the doctor at all if there was nothing wrong with me.
0.238100	I don't feel anxious about the visit. I have lived a healthy lifestyle. I don't expect bad news.
0.785700	how to describe what's going on with me so that I can get real help, not just lip service.  
0.738100	Because I'am getting older not any younger.
0.547600	I get scared that they're going to tell me something is really wrong, even though I have no reason to think that.
0.809500	I have medical PTSD from a very bad experience with an ambulance and hospital. Anything medical worries me. The nurse, in particular, is rude and has no business being in health care. She has mocked my mental health and has gotten away with it. I am afraid of actually telling them how I feel because of this. 
0.833300	I expect bad news. Usually i go to doctors when something is wrong so im on edge anyway.
0.642900	I only have two doctors. I don't like going to my primary care doctor because I don't feel any connection with him. I only go when I really have to, and I feel like I'm judged there, both by my doctor somewhat, and by his assistants. I don't get anxious or worried when I visit my other doctor. 
0.547600	With many problems due to a gastric bypass and anemia, I get worried when I have stomach issues or symptoms related to anemia so when I go to Dr. I think the worst in those cases.
0.809500	Getting wrong advice because I don't fully understand medical language.
0.785700	What makes me feel most anxious or worried about going to see a doctor is that I'm very nervous to tell someone my problems because they might not understand or they might judge me. 
0.452400	I would be worried that something may be bad as I get older.  I typically have good health, but always think the next visit could show a bad diagnosis, worse health, etc...something that could impact my family as well as myself.
0.285700	I only feel anxious if I feel like the doctor has something to tell me but aren't being straight with me. 
0.333300	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor when I have something I need to get checked out and I'm not sure what will be found or the diagnosis will be.
0.547600	I am always a little worried that something is wrong with me, and I didn't know it. I also get worried that the doctor will be judgmental of my life, like if I gained some weight or had drinks over the weekend. 
0.809500	First off I have social anxiety and general anxiety. So everything makes me anxious.  Second off having a strange person poke and prod at me bothers me to a high degree.  Then there is the worry about whether something is wrong physically with me.  
0.142900	Im most anxious that the doctor will miss something important, just give me a medication that I don't need and then push me out the door to fend for myself.
0.142900	Nothing, it doesn't make me anxious to go to the doctor.
0.523800	I feel most anxious when I know that I will have to undergo some kind of testing. Sometimes I worry about receiving negative results, or the doctor finding something unexpected. I worry that I might have an illness that could possibly be debilitating or even life-threatening.
0.476200	Fear of the unknown. Afraid of receiving a diagnosis that is far worse than something I have previously suspected.
0.714300	They might find something seriously wrong with you, or they need to perform some invasive procedure.
0.833300	I feel nervous that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I like to avoid the doctor sometimes for that reason.
0.428600	I am usually most concerned that the doctors will find some health issue that I was not aware of or that I am not taking care of myself well enough. 
0.142900	I feel worried that I there should not be any major or serious issue with my health and I can should get complete relief after visiting the physician.
0.190500	It's the unknown, the uncertainty of it.  If I am there, it's because I was uble to figure it out on my own, or uble to gain access to what I need to treat myself.  Again, a Dr should be viewed as a partner in helping you achieve good health.
0.833300	I just don't usually trust people in general that easily. I also hate that I feel like there job is to judge my everything I do. I feel like many doctors don't follow their own advice which makes them hypocritical. 
0.642900	I always feel anxious when I have to wait for test results. I am also anxious when a doctor does not have a quick solution to my health problems.
0.690500	When I go to the doctor's office I have a hard time not thinking of the worst possible outcome. All the uncertainty can give me anxiety. 
0.761900	The thing that makes me the most worried when visiting the doctor is the unknown.  That I will find out some dreaded news that I did not know before. 
0.142900	Just making sure I am doing what is right for my body, keeping my blood pressure in check and following my heart meds as expected.  I sometimes worry that my benign condition will suddenly become something to worry about.
0.238100	I suppose there is a degree of the unknown. They is always the possibility of them finding something unexpected. Overall, I'm comforted to see a doctor and know they are looking after me.
0.857100	I am anxious about all of the things they check regularly because these things are likely to have some result or they would not check for them in the first place. 
0.285700	I have not had to go to the doctor's office the last few years so I do not recall, I guess it would be when I see needles, though the nice nurses tend to make the anxiety go away
0.261900	When i feel something is wrong with my body and I'm hoping it is nothing too bad. 
0.285700	I am worried that my blood pressure will be high or my weight will be high because i haven't done what she told me to do and I haven't been following the diet that I agreed to follow. I am also worried about finding something else wrong with me. 
0.595200	If I go to the doctor's office, it's because I already know that something is wrong.  I'm in tune with my body and only go to the doctor's when absolutely necessary.  So, I get anxious if I can't tell what's wrong with me and worried about the diagnosis; some people in my family died fairly young.
0.761900	It's always a little awkward to have a physical.  I worry that my breath smells.
0.595200	When I go to the doctor, I find myself far more concerned with the costs associated with being there than I am with my actual health. I feel like I constantly have to decided between taking care of my health and mainting fincial security. Knowing that medical procedures can be very expensive causes me serious anxiety and stress.
0.285700	I don't want to hear any bad news, so it is a little worrisome to have an examition by a doctor. However, if it is a problem which is rather simple like a cold or the flu, then I'm not too worried about those situations.
0.881000	I worry because I have bad habits. I know he' going to tell me things I don't want to hear.
0.476200	The only thing that typically makes me nervous is the doctor finding something that concerns him that I had not recognized in myself.  The fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness, even though i'm not having any symptoms, is really what makes me anxious.
0.571400	That the doctor is going to find or determine that I have an issue or condition I was uware of or not expecting.
0.619000	The thing that makes me most anxious is probably the possibility of having some horrible disease. For all I know, I could go in for a checkup feeling fine and walk out knowing that I have cancer. At the same time I get kind of worried about the doctor misdiagnosing me or missing something important.
0.595200	"The underlying thought ""what if they find something""! It's a universal fear and it is what puts off most people. The worry starts when the nurse and doctor start with the small talk and only abates when it's over and they say you are fine."
0.500000	I am usually not very anxious about going and seeing a doctor.  Seeing a new doctor for the first time always makes me anxious or if I'm worried about my current symptoms and her diagnosis but generally, I'm not anxious about seeing my current doctor when I need to.
0.714300	Just the fact that I'm sick enough to be at the doctor's is enough to make me sick. Then I also start worrying about how I'm going to come up with the money to pay the over-inflated doctors' fees.
0.333300	I tend to feel anxious because I really don't like getting exams. I feel worried because I tend to feel like something will be found even if I am a healthy person.
0.547600	I tend to worry a great deal about the bill.  This makes me overall anxious of the types of tests, etc.  When I am going for a specific issue - as opposed to a check up - I am often a little anxious about what the issue will be.  Will it cause me pain?  Can I recover quickly and easily or will it be on going?  Will it be expensive to treat?
0.547600	I am most anxious or worried about them finding something I did not expect that will negatively impact my health. I am also worried that they will tell me I have been doing something wrong or that I am putting on too much weight.
0.619000	The most anxious part is the waiting, whether it is in the waiting room or inside one of the examition rooms. It is the time where I think about what's going to happen, what the doctor might say, and the necessary questions I need to ask. Since I don't know all of this ahead of time, I'm trying to think of questions for any scerio, which is stressful. 
0.833300	May receive news/diagnosis that you do not want to hear
0.357100	What makes me most anxious when visiting the doctor is myself. Aside from strep throat, which I get fairly often, I usually have a worse case scerio that turns out not to be so bad afterward. 
0.142900	I'm in good health so I am never nervous about seeing my doctor. I go once a year for a check-up. The only thing that bothers me is the blood draw that he orders each time, this is needed to monitor my PSA because of a previous cancer diagnosis.  I also don't care much for the colonoscopy I must endure every three years.
0.666700	I wonder whether I am going to have wait a long time. I also wonder whether something is going to be wrong with me. 
0.833300	I always feel like I may be getting judged and also wondering about the outcome. 
0.738100	Im always worried that there may be something more serious wrong with me than what I think there is. It always makes me paranoid that I will find out something negative.
0.547600	I hate feeling like I might have some lingering undetectable disease that's going to kill me at any time and suddenly finding out about it and realizing I only have a few months to live.
0.571400	If they will find anything wrong 
0.428600	I'm generally worried about my condition. Or the news they'll give me. Or some intrusive test.
0.785700	It's just a weird experience altogether. Having a stranger poke and prod me is not something that makes me feel comfortable. They ask a lot of questions and the little gowns are way too small and don't make me feel any less ked.
0.452400	I have had a serious condition in the past. It's not the doctor it's what she might find.
0.714300	The only thing that would make me feel worried was if I was really sick or though that a really bad diagnosis was on it's way.   Not knowing what is wrong is the main worry that I would have.
0.738100	What makes me most anxious is finding out that I have some horrible sort of disease or illness. I also tend to feel worried that I'll be taken advantage of.
0.785700	Nothing in particular about visiting the doctor, except for the last one I visited. (I tend to be a bit high strung or anxious, anyway; I have chronic clinical depression.)
0.690500	I worry that there will be something seriously wrong even if I am just going in for a cold.  Many times I think about what could be the worst possible scerio as far as sickness could go.  Or I am afraid that the doctor won't be able to figure out what the problem is and I will have to continue to be in pain.
0.571400	I always get uneasy when a doctor is feeling around my body. I'm always waiting for a bad response, like a lump or something that shouldn't be there.
0.881000	I have a really bad anxiety disorder that makes it hard to cope with that situation. Also, if a new nurse is involved who doesn't know me well, it is hard to cope with. 
0.928600	"I worry that I'm going to find out the treatment for whatever is wrong with me is going to be uvailable to me due to cost. Also I hate the general ""invasion of privacy"" feeling that it causes, particularly if I happen not to be alone when I am visiting the doctor."
0.738100	basically i feel uneasy because it's a sense of what is gon be wrong this time? i also in the back of my mind wonder if i will be mis diagnosed based on previous bad experience of filly getting wrist surgery 8 months too late
0.309500	I am most anxious about screenings for diseases such as cancer and heart because there's always an element of doubt on how the results will be and if I would require further tests. 
0.285700	I only feel anxious or worried if I suspect something's wrong with me. Otherwise I'm always pretty relaxed in the doctor's office, and pretty comfortable with the nurses and staff in general.
0.381000	I get anxious about being weighed, about what my blood pressure will be and about getting ked.
0.190500	I have HIV so I am always worried that my medications may stop working or if I am starting a new treatment that it may not be as useful as my prior regime.
0.666700	Doctors finding tumors.
0.500000	When I first started going to him it had been quite a while since I have had a primary doctor. I was very anxious about my test results. I had 2 serious issues. The first one is completely under control now. We are working on the second. This had decreased my anxiety. I guess my anxiety stems from not knowing about any issues I have.
0.142900	I guess I am sometimes anxious when I feel I might have something wrong with me. I get a bit worried about what it actually is and whether it is dangerous. Otherwise I am never worried about the actually doctor's office visit itself.
0.785700	Well when its a cold or the flu it isn't that bad. It's when you don't know what illness you have that's really scary. When you have this unexplained pain that doesn't go away and you mistakenly look on the internet for answers towards what it may be. Even without the internet, sitting there with pain in an area that could have a serious illness like cancer, waiting for the doctor to come back with his diagnoses would make anyone anxious. Simply, people fear hearing the possibility of bad news, no matter how big or small. 
0.214300	Because at home my blood pressure is good but as soon as the doctor comes in to take it, it goes up
0.690500	I worry about the communication aspect of a doctor's visit. I know that I will not ask the questions that I should ask and may not remember the information they have told me.
0.285700	That I might find out something new I have to deal with, when I really don't have the time or patience for more medical drama. 
0.690500	finding out something bad
0.238100	Anything that requires a time-delay worries me: bloodwork, urine alysis, etc. The lab can take a while and my mind always wanders to the worst that could happen. 
1.000000	I feel the most anxious or worried about finding out there may be something seriously medically wrong with me. I usually don't feel super worried if I go in for sinus infection symptoms, or something routine. Last time I went, it was for a breast lump, and I was terrified. 
0.642900	Always worried that something I can't fix will go wrong. I'm like that with everything not just medical problems. Bring my car to the mechanic and wait anxiously until I get the diagnosis. Same is true of my health. I'm sick I go in to find out what's wrong but going to be anxious until i get the all clear.
0.833300	Are they going to see my scars and ask me about them? What if they call the police on me and have me committed against my will?
0.642900	Mostly my weight. It has been an issue due to some of the medications I am on. I worry that I have gained weight each time I visit and that my doctor will comment on it. I also worry about the blood test results I have done each month and hope that they reflect that the medications I am on are working so I don't have to change medications yet again.
0.381000	It makes me feel most anxious or worried when the doctor wants to do numerous tests without explaining why those tests are necessary.
0.761900	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is that I do not know what to expect each time with my persol health and hoping that nothing is going to come up as wrong or a health issue. I also get anxious about just sitting in the waiting room and wondering what will happen when I get called into the office. 
0.142900	What makes me anxious and worried is that they do not listen to what I want or trying to do things a tural way. They just blindly follow protocol and make money for big pharma. Free healthcare is one thing but It would be so much better if we could afford decent rent and space to take care of our well being instead of expensive rent, small spaces and cheap food so that we are stressed and unhealthy. 
0.333300	I am mostly worried about long waits. I am sometimes worried about a possible diagnosis.I am sometime worried bout the doctor's mood.
0.761900	Sometimes, I'm worried that the exam will show something bad...a disease or condition that will require expensive/extensive treatment. Actually, the first thing that stresses me is the weight check.
0.952400	I don't like the atmosphere of doctors offices. I don't like feeling like just another number coming through. I don't feel like I'm being heard or cared about when I am visiting the doctor. 
0.500000	if it is a follow up for something unknown
0.809500	I just hate going there I've always been that way. It's kind of hard to explain. The doctor isn't a big deal but the nurses and assistants are different all the time and do different things like look at different things I don't think really matters. Then there expressions change and they say nothing so this makes me anxious. So pretty much the whole thing I hate, I'm just always happy to get out of there.
0.523800	That something severe is wrong with me
0.571400	Will I remember to tell them all the necessary information.
0.357100	That he's going to tell me something bad. I worry I'll have some medical condition that requires extensive treatment.
0.285700	I don't like having blood drawn. This is the only part of my doctor visits that I don't like. 
0.619000	I just don't like going. It smacks of weakness and it invades my privacy. It's also time consuming and expensive.
0.523800	The possibility of learning some potentially life changing information.  Also the discomfort of some of the procedures. 
0.571400	You never know what is wrong, I get nervous going to the dr with a  complaint not knowing what it is.
0.261900	Recently I worry more about if the doctor will accept my health insurance, than if there is something wrong with me. Also, I'm worrying how much of the bill is my responsibility and how much insurance's.
0.619000	I guess there's always the back-of-the-mind fear that the doctor will find something wrong. That's not usually a huge concern for me, though, because I've always been quite healthy aside from my weight, which I'm working on. Mostly I'm just anxious because there's nearly always SOMETHING uncomfortable in a doctor's visit. Taking off more clothes than I'd like to, or painful examitions (and I have a VERY low pain threshold - I consider those blood pressure cuffs painful), or being told yet again that I'm overweight as if I couldn't see that for myself.
0.714300	Not knowing what will happen
0.690500	If I have something wrong with me that is concerning me that I want looked at, yes I feel anxious. If I am just going for a yearly wellness visit, I am at ease.
0.500000	Not sure what they're going to say, if something is wrong with me.
0.666700	"I am always worried I am going to get a ""death sentence"".  I also worried that the procedure will hurt.  I also worry that the doctor will tell me something that I should be doing, because what I am doing is not good enough."
0.500000	I am just worried that something is more wrong than I thought was actually wrong with me when I went in there. I like being in control of my body but I just fear hearing bad news.
0.333300	It's extremely silly, but ever since I had to learn to perform blood pressure readings in a high school atomy and physiology class I find the idea of the brachial artery being shut off extremely creepy, which stresses me out and raises my (actually a bit too low, when it can be accurately measured) blood pressure. I then get anxious about the fact that the reading will be incorrect, which makes me worry more and drives the reading sky-high. It's an annoying and very nerve-wracking cycle that happens almost every time I go to a doctor's office.
0.619000	im scared what they are going to tell me about my condition and the  office just makes me uneasy, it is not like im going there for a good reason.
0.738100	Mostly just the fact the person is usually someone I haven't met before because I do not have a stable family doctor, and also the cost. 
0.476200	When we're no longer young we are always fearful of a Dr finding some health problem that we may be uware of but I'm in extremely good health so I'm not really anxious when I see my PCP. I'm more anxious about my insurance company denying payment for something or the government (congress) screwing up insurance and chasing sll the Drs out of the profession.
0.142900	If I am worried about what I'm there for, then I'm worried.  For example, I had a lump that needed to be examined. My doctor was not concerned, but because of my level of concern, had no problem referring me for further diagnostics to help ease my mind.  Waiting for the results was the anxious part, but because my doctor was not concerned at all, it helped ease the anxiety.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.
0.857100	I'm anxious about the doctor discovering something that's going to dramatically change my life. There's always the possibility that something dire might turn up.
0.190500	I don't worry much when visiting the doctor.
0.500000	Just that I may have to switch medications or that something new will be discovered. That she will not be able to find or fix what is wrong. That she won't give me a recommendation if she feels it is not needed. 
0.619000	I tend to expect the worst so I often feel anxious about what the actual diagnosis will be. 
0.428600	I dont like needels  
0.738100	I am worried about them finding something big wrong with me.  Something that would change my life drastically or something that cannot be fixed.
0.261900	Because instead of addressing the source of symptoms they usually just give you something to cover up the symptom while the underlying causes just get worse. And also because they are very time inefficient. I once had to sit in a room for an hour and a half with very excruciating pain just for the doctor to figure out my nose was broken, which i already knew but he didnt think so
0.857100	I feel anxious at the doctor because I never know what they will tell me. That alone worries me. What do I have to pay for next is the question in my head.
0.142900	The bills afterwards. I am not really to anxious with the visits.
0.285700	The anxious part is just the exams in general. I don't have great health insurance so if they find anything wrong I couldn't be able to afford it.
0.428600	What the diagnosis will be. If there is anything wrong with me. 
0.595200	I usually do not have anything serious wrong with me so that is not a worry. However, I am always just a little bit afraid that they will find something new is wrong with me that I didn't even know about. I know this is not likely but it is still a fear of mine. 
0.357100	The possibility that I may be examined health problems.
0.166700	Nothing really nowâ because we have had the same Doctor for several years and we know him and converse openly with him. He is friendly and remembers persol details about us which help a lot. He is always open and honest and has always taken very good care of us when we have had needs. We both go to the Doctor regularly and because of that and our relationship with the Doctor there is a large level of comfort now
0.333300	Anixous that there will be something wrong.
0.333300	What worries me is the possibility of the doctor finding something seriously wrong, like cancer. Other than that I don't really worry about doctor appointments.
0.666700	They will get me hooked on some medication that makes me worse and dependent on office visits. 
0.333300	If they were to tell me that I have a loss or restriction of mobility.
0.404800	I am most worried about whether or not the diagnosis will be something minor or major.
0.381000	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is that something could possibly be wrong. Even if I go for a normal checkup and I do not have any signs of anything being wrong with me, just going to the doctor makes me slightly anxious because I know that if there is any bad results this is the place it will come from. 
0.404800	a possibility to hear something bad about my health
0.452400	I feel worried if I think I will get a bad result or hear something I don't want to. I also get nervous around needles. 
0.452400	If I'm sick but I don't know what I have, I might be a little anxious to hear what the diagnosis is.
0.142900	i dont. i am healthy and i have a healthy lifestyle
0.571400	I feel anxious when I require blood draws and I also get anxious sitting in the waiting room. I get worried that there could be something wrong when things progress so slowly during the appointments. 
0.285700	that my doctor is not well informed of my health needs prior to and during the visit
0.142900	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. The doctor has always been patient with me, and very understanding. There's nothing that makes me feel out of place, and the doctor always explain what will happen ahead of time and the reason why.
0.476200	Wondering if something is wrong
0.142900	I don't get anxious at the doctor's office. If I have something wrong with me and they run tests then I might worry about the results, but otherwise I'm pretty calm.
0.595200	I feel nervousness in general, like maybe the doctor will find something that wasn't there before. I am worried they will lecture me about smoking cigarettes. And I am just anxious in general when I go out in public.
0.523800	The possibility that they could find something wrong with me.
0.809500	I am anxious because I can't predict my results. I am most scared of being told my health is in a poor state. Bad news could possibly come out and I wouldn't know what to do about it. 
0.142900	Waiting around sick people, more often than most.
0.642900	i have hypertension and when i go to the doctor, my bp is typically higher than outside the office. the thought of it going higher at the office makes it go higher at the office if you know what i mean. i also don't being weighed as i am currently overweight.
0.500000	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I don't want to find out a have an expensive or deadly issue.
0.738100	I am worried there might be a problem I'm not aware of, especially high blood pressure or thyroid issues which run in my family. I also feel like the nurse and doctors at the practice I go to don't really listen to my concerns much. 
0.738100	My anxiety when visiting a doctor's office is pretty irratiol, but I can't deny that I feel it. It's largely because of the uncertainty of the experience. Even if I feel that I am in good health, it's possible that the doctor could tell me I am in poor health or have a condition I was uware of. Though knowing about the condition would be positive overall, it is a frightening thing. 
0.595200	I used to feel worried when discussing the symptoms and progression of sickness. Now I don't care to the same degree unless I am presented with a new symptom. 
1.000000	I HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS.
0.142900	I think what would make me feel most anxious would be if my doctor found something wrong with me
1.000000	Just that I don't go very often at all, and I'm not young. Sooner or later, they are going to find something wrong. I also don't like getting undressed for anyone. I have major self esteem issues, and as I said, I am a very nervous person. 
0.285700	I hate needles and whenever going to the doctor, that is my first thought that makes me anxious, are they going to want to give me a shot. Since I do not take pills, sometimes a shot is needed and I hate those. But, I can take them without much pain, it's just the idea- maybe some fear left over from childhood- I don't know. But, that is mainly what makes me anxious. The other thing is doctors always have to rub or push wherever it hurts and that bothers me.
0.571400	Not knowing what is wrong with me and I get worried about if anything has gotten worse
0.547600	I always feel anxious and worried about what may be the outcome of whatever is going on.
0.142900	I really don't feel anxious or worried at all going to the doctor. I feel relieved that I am going to get better with her help. I guess a worry would always be finding out news that you may die soon, but I'm young so I really don't think about that.
0.881000	What makes me anxious is the possibility of having a serious condition. I know it's just a small chance of it, but just the possibility of that make me very nervous and scared. 
0.619000	I worry that the doctor will just brush off my concerns. I also worry because I have a history of cancer in my family.
0.714300	Ever since I found out I have a rare blood disease I feel a sense of dread and worry whenever I see the doctor.  It passes as soon as she tells me everything is okay, but up until that moment, I feel worried and nervous.
0.785700	A physical exam is generally unpleasant to me. I worry about what professiols might think about my body, or me in general. I also worry that something unexpected might show up and my health is declining.
0.309500	I usually have alot of visits to the doctor because of a few health issues i have. And always when i get examined i am anxious even thou i know i am okay i would always be anxious cause you never know how your body is going to change wether in a good way or bad.
0.500000	Even though I'm very healthy overall and generally feel pretty good, there's always that gging idea in the background that they may discover something seriously wrong that isn't currently presenting any symptoms. It's also just an anxious situation in general when another person you don't know well - or know at all - is examining your body and mind and peering into some persol and private things, even if you trust them to be objective and professiol about it.
0.333300	I tend to be anxious in general. I worry the doctor won't understand my concern, won't be able to help me or will choose not to.
0.500000	It is a woman and though I am not ashamed to undress for her,it still leels a little bit uneasy.I would feel worried,when I have to see her,when I have sudden complaints,that don't go away.
0.357100	Most of my anxiety comes from the doctor feeling that I need further testing beyond what is covered by my insurance. 
0.571400	My doctor often tells me to quite smoking, but have not quite yet. I get worried that he is going to get mad at me for still smoking.
0.261900	Not knowing whether or not my condition is improving.  Sometimes, it's hard to tell without lab work, as I feel fine most of the time.  
0.285700	Not really much does.   I am a level headed person.  The only thing that would make me anxious is if I felt something was wrong, not with the care I actually receive.
0.142900	nothing makes me feel most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor's office... 
0.881000	I am worried that they will find something serious. Although I'd rather know than not know.
0.523800	 Not knowing what the outcome will be. Wondering if they will be able to figure out what's wrong, and give me the proper treatment. 
0.928600	I am always concerned that they will find something that will require further testing. In my past experience, further tests can be expensive and painful, and for me have always turned out fine. But even still, it is scary to decide to ignore the doctor's advice and not do further tests. 
0.238100	I have always been anxious when I go in for a physical , hoping the results be favorable
0.785700	worried about getting illnesses
0.357100	Having someone poke me and hover around me. I like my space.
0.142900	Poor communication makes me wonder about the doctor.
0.523800	I worry that he might find something that I didn't know about.  Like some growth or cancer or something.  It's just the unknown and then what it might lead to. 
0.809500	Now we cannot see the Dr.'s we trust. We have to see Dr.'s that are assigned to us. Usually, I am rushed through or disrespected. I don't go for this reason. I'll just die in my home. 
0.952400	I have social anxiety. Going to see a doctor is like being asked to perform on broadway completely ked without ever having been given a script. You don't know what to expect. You feel like the doctor might be secretly judging you, and when it's all done you might find out that you are gon be dead in a month.
0.452400	I think I'm always just worried about what they are going to find out next. After all is said and done I feel all the anxiety is gone.
0.904800	I know that my specific concerns will likely not be addressed
0.238100	I REALLY DO NOT FEEL VERY ANXIOUS GOING TO THE DOCTOR UNLESS I GO THERE WITH SOME COMPLAINT. IN THAT CASE, I HAVE A SLIGHT WORRY THAT THE CONDITION MAY BE MORE SERIOUS, PERSISTENT, OR REQUIRE MORE ATTENTION THAN I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH. ALMOST ALL MY VISITS ARE FOR ROUTINE CHECK-UPS, AND I FEEL NO ANXIETY ABOUT THEM.
0.357100	Sometimes, I felt uncertain about my disease condition and related treatments when visiting the doctor's office. I was not sure if I should take a new medicine for my disease. 
0.238100	I am more worried that the might find something wrong with me. I don't really ever think about being sick until I go to the doctor's office. 
0.642900	Now that I am getting older, I worry they may find something that could be serious.
0.333300	My cholesterol levels and my sugar levels. I have high cholesterol though my LDL is good so not concerning. My sugar levels have spiked the last few years and several times I have been warned of pre-diabeties.
0.881000	Blood work mostly, procedures that could go wrong, not really listening to me. The whole thing is a stressor.
0.738100	Generally I am worried about the possibility of needing to get my blood drawn, as I have a severe phobia of injections.
0.761900	Honestly, that they think I am exaderatting my symptoms - or that they will not know what to do and i go undigainosed or mis diagnosed because they are not allowed to perform the tests that they should be cause of cost
0.142900	When a treatment is not working and we have to explore altertives
0.142900	well if it is not my own doctor I guess the thing I would be worried about would be judgement or not listening to me.
0.690500	Shame, afraid that I will be judged for not taking better care of myself. Anxious based on past experience when the doctors wouldn't listen to me and couldn't figure out what was wrong.
0.214300	As I get older, there is always the fear of what they might find - something that just pops up.
0.714300	Fincial requirements are number one. I have insurance but can not afford very much out of pocket expense. As far as whether the treatment is correct, I seldom worry about that cause I can just skip the recommended treatment when I get home. So I have to make sure whatever is done is covered by insurance or I probably will not do it.
0.500000	I worry that the doctor may find something serious wrong with me, and I worry that he may prescribe tests or medications that will cost more money than I can afford to spend. I'm fairly healthy, so mostly I worry about the costs.
0.142900	Don't really feel worried. Just depends if its something major would make me feel worried. 
0.523800	I have had breast cancer and am now always ready for the shoe to drop when I am in to see her.
0.381000	I am afraid that my blood pressure is going to be high and then this will be the visit I'm stuck on blood pressure meds.
0.571400	just the waiting to see what he or she says
0.142900	The thought of having a newly discovered illness is what tends to worry me the most about visiting a doctor. I always have a fear when new tests are run the doctor may discover cancer or some other life-threatening illness.
0.238100	The fact that something else could be wrong with me. I usually like going to the doctors. So, not too   much stress.
0.714300	Not knowing if something may actually be wrong with my health
0.142900	I get a little worried when my doctor recommends something I don't want to do (like a colonoscopy). In general, however, I am not worried at all. My doctor knows that I might not agree with everything he says and I always have the option of going to another doctor.
0.500000	That I will receive bad news - whether that is pregncy or a medical condition I didn't expect.
0.214300	I have a general anxiety disorder so sometimes even the most common events can make me feel anxious. It really has nothing to do with the appointment. it just happens.
0.738100	What makes me most anxious is finding out the worst possible news in regards to the medical conditions I have had. I feel this way because I am a worse case scerio kind of person.  So I already have thoughts of what they might tell me.
0.500000	I hate going to pay a copay and then not get what I feel is the best option for me. It stresses me out to go and also I don't drive so getting there its not an easy task in general. So its just getting there and still having unresolved concern.
0.476200	Just sitting there, waiting for her to come in, thinking about how to tell her what has been going on with me (why I'm there to see her), about what she will find/diagnose.
0.476200	"Always experiencing the worst case scerio when identifying illness. For instance, ""my leg pain is getting bad"" with the doctor response of ""well, I guess we should saw it completely off""."
0.666700	The actual exam. I just don't like people touching me that way.
0.785700	The exam itself especially from a gynecologist. I hate being nude even with a Dr I really like and trust. I feel exposed.
0.785700	I am worried that my doctor will do a seemingly common test that will indicate i have a life-threatening medical condition that i was completely oblivious to.
0.333300	I sometimes feel worried when visiting the doctors office because if I am there it's because I'm not feeling well.  But I feel regular checkups are a good thing to stay healthy.
0.238100	Visiting a new doctor can be a bit stressful because I don't know if he/she will listen to me or be accepting of me. Beyond that, there is always a bit of anxiety that something might be wrong with my health.
0.214300	"I think there is a general anxiety when visiting a doctor or dentist's office. I feel more anxious when I am in the office because of a serious problem I am having. The anxiety is not caused by the doctor but rather by the possibility my ""ailment"" might turn out to be serious."
0.142900	For now, I don't feel that way because I trust my Doctor so much.Seems that he is my family or brother
0.381000	I am worried that my doctor will discover a health issue and not be able to adequately explain the cause or offer treatment solutions.
0.785700	That I've either come in about an issue that's too trivial to need a doctor's attention, or that I've waited too long on an issue when I should have known it was more serious. Basically that there are multiple ways my own judgement could be wrong. That I'll embarrass myself by making a bigger deal out of something than is warranted. That I might have to redirect a conversation of the doctor seems to jump to wrong conclusions or makes bad assumptions.
0.428600	just the wait always makes me anxious. 
0.595200	What makes me feel worried is the thought of a bad health report. As I get older and my body starts to slow down, I feel I'm more prone to bad health. What if I suddenly have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or my urine shows signs of XYZ, etc, If a doctor comes back with news like that, it's sure to have me worried at least a little.
0.595200	it might be bad experiences in my childhood
0.857100	"I feel the most anxious about the unknown.  Even totally healthy people can have bad things happen and I have not been living the healthiest lifestyle.  I worry that there will be something wrong with me that cannot be ""fixed."""
0.595200	It makes me feel worried that the doctor might discover a problem during the examition that I didn't know about.
0.452400	I get anxious about my lab results for my condition and also about my weight. 
0.452400	Since I have had numerous medical issues, I do have some anxiety or worry that something may be amiss when i discuss current symptoms or have to get certain blood work done.  I usually, however, keep things under control!
0.285700	The only thing that really worries me is that they will find something bad, like cancer or something that will be expensive or difficult to treat. And depending on what happens with the ACA, I am also a little worried about what they will notate in my file. 
0.714300	When I visit a Doctor's office, it is because I am already showing symptoms of something that has not gone away on its own. As a result, I am already worried prior to the visit, as if it doesn't go away on its own, it may be serious.
0.714300	I've had exams by very rude and impatient ER doctors before that made me feel less than human. 
0.833300	I'm worried they will find something.  I'm worried that the doctor may think less of me because I'm overweight.
0.738100	That the doctor may find something wrong. That I may not be taken seriously. General anxiety and panic due to mental health issues.
0.952400	I do not like to be touched by people, so being examined is extremely stressful to me.  I am also a nervous person in general, so it does not take much to get me worked up.  I tend to be pessimistic, so it is easy for me to assume the worst about health conditions.  I (and members of my family) have been brushed off when we did bring up medical complaints, so I tend to worry whether the doctor will take my complaints seriously.     
0.238100	I am not sure why I might feel anxious or worried.  
0.857100	Going to the doctor's office makes me feel like I'm going to take a test I haven't studied for. I'm fearful of potential health defects but also of just being judged in general. I am aware on a logical level that this is silly but the feelings persist anyways.
0.404800	I persolly just dislike the actual procedures. I'm not fond of the actual process as I am a very private person.
0.357100	Cost of treatment Treating the pain or injury I have would cause me to stop doing something I like to do.
0.738100	I hate having to slightly disrobe for something that is no fun at all! If the doctor looked like Brad Pitt, then I would be happy to go. 
0.523800	Asking everything I want to.  Not forgetting something.  Trying not to be too much of an annoyance.
0.333300	I feel a bit anxious when I visit the doctor simply because I'm in a position where I may learn some worrisome things about my health. The potential is always there for negative news when you're visiting the doctor, so a bit of anxiousness seems inevitable. 
0.547600	Being in that paper gown makes me uncomfortable. You aren't always at your best when you need to visit the doctor. I may have a serious problem or feel very sick.
0.571400	"I have had fairly aggressive responses from professiols when I ask them simple questions. When I ask my healthcare providers questions I either get unsatisfactory answers or outright defiance. It is too easy to offend a medical professiol by ""questioning them"". Studies show that for a therapist their compassion is more highly correlated with their success than their skillset or education. As computers become more capable of diagnosing health problems (and as most doctors just put your symptoms into google these days anyway), I think we will have less autistic doctors that can ace any test and less stress in the doctor's office."
0.285700	Uncertainty about my illness, or the treatment I may need.
0.142900	I have a condition that is called white coat syndrome. When I go to the doctor even though I do not feel different my bp rises. After I settle down I come out normal. I do sometime feel a little bit nervous when getting back blood tests but other than that I look forward to seeing my doctor. 
0.357100	They could find that something is wrong with me.
0.881000	I feel most nervous that they are going to tell me about something that will kill me that I was uware of. 
0.785700	I worry that I won't be taken seriously. I worry that I won't be able to get what I need. I feel anxious about experiencing prejudice (many healthcare professiols have prejudice against fat patients and transgender patients). I worry about the results of lab tests. 
0.428600	I guess whether or not something will be wrong with me that I'm not aware of. I don't normally think like this though. 
0.666700	What makes me most worried when visiting the doctor is learning that I have an illness or other negative condition that was preventable. Next is learning about an illness or condition that is neither treatable nor preventable.
0.381000	Honestly the most anxious I get is over getting shots. I know they're important but they trigger a phobia in me and it makes me very uneasy to deal with it. 
0.571400	I don't know what the outcome is going to be.  Is this going to be a serious issue?  Will it be expensive?  Perhaps, I'm also somewhat anxious about whether or not they will be able to tell me what is wrong at all.
0.928600	I never know what to expect.  It's good that i go but it's extremely stressful knowing they could find something drastically wrong.  There is nothing I like about it.
0.142900	Nothing beyond whatever I'm there for.
0.166700	That I will be embarrassed, and also I worry about the result they will give me.
0.452400	I worry if the doctor may be right in the diagnosis and I worry that the doctor would prescribe a medication that would eventually harm me in the long term. I feel that the doctor only concern about making her quota for the day and would not give me the full attention i require.
0.690500	i always seem to get bad news. i hate being told or wondering if i am doing things right. everything seem so cold and sterile.
0.666700	I'm most anxious when waiting around. If there are test results in limbo, etc. My general experience is relief when I take care of whatever issues are at play.
0.619000	I've had so many health problems in the last 10 years that a visit to the Dr. is almost never good news.
0.928600	That my knowledge of my body and my views about medicine and disease will not be respected. That I will be forced into treatments that run counter to my beliefs. That I will be abused and put through unnecessary procedures or tests.
0.738100	I'm more worried they might find something bad that I wasn't aware of. This is more me worrying than anything as it's rare they find anything serious. Most of the time the problem isn't serious and they can treat it. I just kinda hold my breath when I'm at the doctor anyway, you never know if they'll find something you don't know about....
1.000000	I am worried about the cost, about whether or not the staff are friendly, if whatever I am going in there for is going to end up being something worse than I expected. There are a ton of reasons to feel complete and utter anxiety and worry while you're in there. That's why a lot of people don't go. 
0.404800	I am usually worried about the results of a blood test and just making sure my numbers are okay in general.
0.381000	I tend to be anxious in unusual social situations. Being in a small room with another person puts me on edge regardless of the actions of the physician. 
0.738100	Nothing
0.642900	I'm just a very anxious person in general, and I have white coat syndrome, so my blood pressure rises when I go to the doctor, which in turn makes the doctors/nurses worried, which makes my anxiety increase. I also get anxious that the doctor will find something wrong with me, which will have a negative impact on my life.
0.238100	I tend to worry in general, and when I get blood work done I worry that my results will not be good. I worry that conditions that I have will not improve from one appointment to the next. I'm on medication for these conditions and I worry that a combition of these medications and changes I've made to my diet and lifestyle won't have a positive effect. So far I have had positive results, but I worry every time that that won't continue. When I first started seeing my primary care doctor I was worried that I might not like her or might not be comfortable with her, but we have developed a pretty good relationship. 
0.428600	I don't like getting my blood drawn. I hate needles.
0.642900	If the doctors says unpredictable things or some thing bad it scare me to see the doctor.
0.166700	Just the out-of-routine occurance. A visit to the doctor is not a normal daily occurance for me.
0.642900	whether i will get the best solution for me
0.690500	I am most anxious about finding a reason and remedy for any health problems. I become worried about invasive and expensive testing that give no answers. I worry about being overlooked or ignored about my concerns.
0.476200	Wondering what battery of tests or measures may be necessary, whether something unplanned or unnounced will be painful or stressful.
0.142900	Nothing, I love visiting my doctor.
0.642900	Can they be trusted?
0.595200	Waiting for news. 
0.357100	The chance of receiving bad news I suppose. I have cancer in my family and it is always a worry of mine. 
0.785700	I'm not sure there's anything specific. The whole visit is overwhelming. I'm nervous I won't get to tell them what's wrong. That they will be rushing and not listening to you. If you go for a physical and tell them things that have been wrong with you, you have to worry about insurance because it's no longer a physical. You worry about them overbilling because if you aren't requesting an itemized bill, you know they are.
0.381000	I only worry if I think something is wrong. I visit my doctor to decrease my worry.
0.595200	I'm afraid they will tell me something bad. 
0.976200	The uncertainty of the potential outcome is what worries me most.  That uncertainty stems from a fear that something may be terribly wrong with me. Along with that, there's always the fear that either way, I'm going to have to undergo frightening procedures that may include getting needles (I have a phobia of them).
0.619000	I think the biggest thing is that I always think the worst and assume I will get bad news a lot of times. It takes a lot for me to go to the doctor usually so when I do go I get nervous and anxious. 
0.785700	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel most anxious about having my weight and blood pressure checked, because they are usually higher than recommended. I also feel stupid if I need to ask for clarification if I don't understand something the doctor said. And just being around people in general (in the waiting room, for example) makes me very anxious. I fear judgment and criticism, and also fear possibly becoming ill from sick patients.
0.476200	I feel anxious at time of visitation because I feel sometimes they will give me some negative results about my health.  
0.714300	I am always a little worried that they are going to find something seriously wrong with me. The only doctors I have been to in the past few years are baby doctors and they are typically very good at relieving those worries.
0.714300	i hate to go to clinic  the atmosphere makes me sick more
0.666700	I do not visit the doctor's office often but when I do I always automatically get an un-easy feeling of nervousness. I can not explain why I feel this way.
0.142900	My health is what worries me. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong. New doctors also make me a little anxious.
0.333300	Just the unsureness of what could be wrong with me. 
0.642900	I am not an anxious or worrisome person, but I do often feel these emotions in a doctor's office. Sometimes I worry that my condition may be worse than I am assuming. Also, I guess as a gut feeling, I just don't like doctor's offices, which helps to invoke these emotions.
0.785700	That they will press on an issue that I don't feel like looking into or that I don't feel is serious. That they will refuse to continue seeing me if I don't do some kind of testing that I don't want to do. That they will think I'm lying when I say I have no issues. 
0.666700	Just being in a doctor's office makes me anxious. You know you are there because you're not feeling well, but you don't know the exact reason why and you never know what you might be diagnosed with. You also never know if the doctor is going to reprimand you about the way that you handle your health and that can be embarrassing and upsetting. I am a relatively private person and I hate putting myself so out there and that includes telling the doctor private health information.
0.500000	When I have to get on a scale. I hate getting on a scale...period. I'm not morbidly obese or anything, but it makes me very anxious. I wish people didn't insist on weighing  people everywhere. 
0.428600	Just the rush rush of it all. I do not really trust that dr's are really listening to what you are saying.
0.309500	I think that what makes me worried the most is that they might  find something really wrong. 
0.476200	I always believe something is wrong when they don't just tell fast. I feel that they are annoyed someone came to get better.
0.666700	The language barrier concerns me most.  What he says and what I think he means are sometimes different.  As an example, they tell me that tests I need to take for an existing condition are preventive; they are not preventive if I already have the condition.  The tests at that stage are diagnostic.  They are more concerned with a patient taking standard tests than treating them for the condition the patient is most worried about. 
0.285700	I don't know. Nothing really. If I have a concern that I think something is really bad, I would probably be nervous. If I had no idea what was going on with my health.
0.285700	I do not typically get worried when going to the Dr. Unless it is going to be a painful procedure.
0.642900	I would feel most anxious while visiting the doctor's office because I would fear that there was something else wrong with me instead of what I was going in for.
0.142900	I worry about what my blood pressure will be that is basically all that I worry about them doing
0.523800	"Really, the only thing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the potential for unknowns. While my health may not be the best, I have never encountered anything ""serious"" when seeing my doctor. I am always somewhat concerned that he may one day find something that requires serious medical attention, and that worries me."
0.142900	I feel most worried that the doctor will find something, maybe it's cancer, or some other neurological disease. But even though logically, I shouldn't worry, it just becomes automatic. 
0.190500	"Mostly it's finding out something is wrong. Other than that, it's more of ""did I cut my ils, or wash well"", and making sure I don't smell. The exam is just ""there"", and doesn't cause me too much worry."
0.571400	There is nothing in particular, it is just a generalized anxiety I get just by going to the doctor. It is just an uneasiness that I get just being there. 
0.571400	Because of how people can't do things with how the doctor's office and the results
0.523800	Uncomfortable questions. And also the dread that he will find something wrong with me. 
0.238100	I not the type of person who gets anxious or worries about anything. If i felt anything it would be uncertainty about finding out about some condition I wasn't aware of.
0.381000	I would say the only thing that really makes me worried is the chance that my doctor will have some bad news for me after a checkup. Something like cancer or another terrible disease.   
0.333300	The only thing that makes me nervous is when they take blood because I hate needles.  I also have in the back of my mind the notion that the blood might come back with something negative that might negatively affect my life.
0.238100	I am always anxious about my blood work.   However, nothing ever turns up bad so that is a relief.  
0.142900	Having to do an unexpected procedure that either is somewhat painful or time consuming. Having to wait to see the doctor. 
0.714300	I don't like to have my body examined, as I feel a little uncomfortable with it. Also I am always worried he might find something seriously wrong with my health. 
0.571400	I don't really feel anxious when I visit my main doctor (as described previously), but I've had a certain amount of doctor phobia as long as I can remember/since I was a small child.  I'm really irratiolly afraid of needles and especially injections.  I am capable of having blood drawn if I lay down, but I have a feeling there's part of me that always expects at a GP's place or something that they're going to want to give me a shot or something...  I know that won't happen at the endocrinologist's office, ha
0.619000	I get nervous because a lot of people in my family have had cancer, I've been pretty healthy my whole life but I'm afraid my luck will run out and I'll get it too.
0.428600	I am most anxious about the doctor not knowing what the issue is.  I am anxious about anything requiring surgery.  I am fearful of debilitation.
0.500000	Don't have any complications or disorder. Still anxious about needles since I was little.
0.452400	I usually get my blood drawn when I see my doctor. He does it as a good habit, I suppose. I'm terrified of needles.
0.523800	I only go to the doctor for a yearly physical exam, pap smear, and mammogram or if I am feeling ill. I am concerned I may not be explaining what I am feeling properly and give iccurate information. Then, I would receive the wrong treatment.
0.714300	My blood pressure is always high and it is even higher when I go to the doctor's office.  I am always anxious because I'm expecting it to be high.
0.619000	I feel a bit anxious about visiting the doctor's office, due to the results of my vital signs and weight.  Sometimes my blood pressure is a little high when I am at the doctor's office and my physician even knows that this is due to a little nervousness at his office. The reason behind this uneasiness is the fear of finding bad or high risk results about my health.
0.690500	Not knowing the severity of my condition and the thought of being given drugs that will have terrible side effects.
0.714300	I worried about what the diagnosis the doctor will tell me.  Will it require surgery, how long the recovery period will be if surgery is required, is it a termil illness, or a decline in my mental faculties?
0.571400	I never know if something is wrong that I don't know about or if the doctor will find something that I didn't know was wrong. 
0.142900	Sometimes I may feel that way but it is not because of the actual visit is. It is more because I have to be there in the first place, meaning something is really going on with me and I am anxious to find out what it is.
0.476200	I worry the most about the diseases that the other patients are bringing to the waiting room. I also worry about the cost and the excuses my insurance company will give me for not covering what they are supposed to cover. I worry a little bit about the quality of care and whether or not anyone in the office will take their profession seriously during my visit.
0.738100	about what he will tell me if something is wrong.sometimes my sugar levels are high and he gets a little upset because he is very concerned about it.
0.285700	I really don't feel nervous visiting.  If it's a check up I feel pretty good about it and don't really worry about what they might fine (I can't change it anyway and would rather know).  I think the only thing I don't like is when they take blood.  Sometimes it goes smooth and other times it's painful as they have to restick me several times.  Other than that it's all good.
0.952400	I think that I'll be diagnosed with the worst condition and will need surgery. I have white coat syndrome so my worries are numerous and most of them are silly but I'm working on meditating to control my anxiety. 
0.357100	I'm sometimes a little anxious about being physically examined by someone I don't know well. I'm sometimes a little worried that there might be something seriously wrong. And crowded waiting rooms and long wait times are stressful, so I don't look forward to that.
0.904800	I'm usually worried that I will get bad news. I get anxious that they will tell me something is very wrong. Or if I don't know the doctor I get scared that they won't treat me right. 
0.642900	That i am wasting my time and not going to get the help i need to fix or understand my problems. Most of my problems are not real bad just yet but they are problems i want to understand before they become major issues.
0.785700	The unknown.  I never have been comfortable with doctors and the older I have gotten, the less I trust doctors, especially since the ovomitdon;tcare tax went into effect and we are refused treatment once we reach the age that we cannot work and support the correct number of career welfare families.  
0.690500	The results of tests.  That can mean blood work or various other tests.  I also had unprotected sex which made me nervous waiting for the test results for that.
0.238100	I'm often worried that the solution to my problem will be complicated or very time-consuming/expensive.
0.166700	I'm not typically worried or anxious when I visit a doctor's office.
0.142900	I just have no faith in any of them and feel I'm going to have to visit at least one more time permitting to get a second opinion and they always say it's something else so then you have to figure out which is correct which means a third opinion or simply suffering until your body kicks the ailment itself.
0.285700	I do not like having blood work done. I hate needles and it makes me uncomfortable.  I also dislike going to my gynecologist. 
0.404800	Most my symptoms are things that I worry about, and not the doctor herself. I am fearful that some of the pains I am having are serious medical conditions.
0.190500	I'm not worried just cautious and aware..educated... 
0.571400	I'm passed the point where I receive good news at the doctor
0.261900	Just the concern that something may be worse.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious at all at a doctors office. I feel like I'm doing things that I should probably do more often, but I don't because of fincial reasons.
0.619000	Unless it for just a regular check up I'm there for a reason which I need help with I'm worried. If I'm feeling pain especially in abdomen I'm especially worried it might be something serious like cancer.
0.142900	Nothing really does, unless I am there in pain or concerned about my health for some reason, that usually is not the case though.
0.714300	I worry that the doctor will find a health problem I am not already aware of. I worry that the doctor will get short if I ask too many questions. I worry that the doctor is so attuned to conventiol options that he won't think broadly about new possibilities to address conditions with less side effects and more benefits.
0.500000	I am worried that something might be wrong. I don't usually go to the doctor so when I do, its because of some pain or problem so I am anxious that it is very serious
0.571400	Certainly there's some anxiety or dread in going to the doctor. Whether it's just an exam or you're going for a specific purpose, there's always some uncertainty about what the doctor will say. It could be everything's ok or you have some serious medical problems. That uncertainty makes it tural to be anxious.
0.666700	Most doctors offices are terribly sterile and uninviting and don't foster any since of being a caring individual. It makes me feel like a piece of meat.
0.690500	If the doctor will sound harsh or criticize me.  If the doctor will ignore or discredit what I say.  If I end up having a really bad health problem.
0.166700	The only thing I fear is the wait. This makes me anxious because I do not like to waste time. Sometimes this can be the worst part of the doctor visit.
0.142900	Not knowing what is wrong with me if I have to go to the doctor or maybe having to get more tests done than I thought.
0.142900	getting blood drawn is what makes me the most anxious. when i get blood drawn i always pass out.
0.285700	It'll sound odd, but okay. It's extremely rare for me to catch a cold, but I always feel a little anxious about the potential germs. The main reason getting sick bothers me is that it'll get in the way of my weight training (and I happen to be a training stimulus addict). Ironically enough, nothing else bothers me...I maintain a single digit body fat percentage virtually year-round, and my doctor often comes to me for fitness advice ;-)
0.642900	The unknown of what the doctor will say. You are always worried that the doctor will find something unexpected. 
0.738100	It is just an uncomfortable feeling. I don't think anyone looks forward to going to the doctor.
0.500000	I have high blood pressure. I'm always anxious about have my blood pressure tested because it varies so much and it is usually high when I go to the doctor's office because I have walked to get there. Sometimes it bothers me because the nurses get a high reading and are overly concerned. If the doctor takes the blood pressure later it's usually lower, but the nurses don't seem to understand that.
0.833300	i am getting older now,and i sometimes wonder,if something really horrible will be found wrong with me.it seems i wake up with a new ache or pain daily.
0.142900	I usually feel quite good so I am never nervous about my checkups.  Fortutely I am extremely healthy and always have been.  The worst problem I've had is sciatica and I went to PE for that. 
0.523800	If anything it's that the doctor might tell me something is going on with me that is worse than I am aware of/anticipating. 
0.761900	I just worry they will find some major health issue wrong with me. 
0.500000	Hoping my chronic health conditions are not gettimg worse. Nervous about test results. Trying to be optimistic.
0.738100	What makes me most anxious about a doctor visit is two-fold: the thought of finding out something dreadful is wrong OR that nothing is wrong and I look the fool. 
0.333300	I always wonder if they will find something else wrong, besides the problem that I am there for.  I usually get a little anxious because I know that I have waited too long before going to see the doctor.
0.500000	When I visit my doctor for my examitions I am always anxious about m results. I always think that something might go wrong and this makes me nervous.
0.690500	Sometimes when going into the Dr's office with symptoms that seem like they maybe severe I become anxious while waiting for the exam and tests to determine my issue.  I also get anxious because it seems like the dr always wants to discuss worst possible issues first.
0.690500	Finding out the cause of any medical issues I am contending with. 
0.357100	I feel worried, because I am not sure I get the best medical advice. Some anxiety comes from realization that my doctor doesn't incentives to give me his utmost attention.
0.642900	I worry that I wont cover all the things I feel like I should talk to the doctor about in order for them to give me proper medical care and that the reason I wont is because I worry they will think I'm some kind of hypochondriac (although I see a doctor less than once a year, sometimes if you have a lot of concerns when you see them they seem to become pretty tired and dismissive as the exam proceeds.)
0.357100	i get the white coat syndome when they take my bp it always goes way up and scares me
0.619000	You know when you don't feel well or are in pain, but there are tests and measurements that can locate possible diseases or health issues that I may not even be aware of.  I'm also not very comfortable being ked, so that's very nerve wracking.
0.381000	They advise me on weight loss as if it can be done over night or its really easy.
0.595200	When the doctor is concerned about particular health issues I may have, I get a little anxious and worried but he has been the calm one in this relationship. He makes me feel better by explaining the whole process of care very clearly.
0.595200	I'm always worried when I go to the doctor because of the history of cancer in my family.  I get worried that little things may be precursor's to cancer or something worse.
0.547600	In my current situation, the cost is my biggest concern. Otherwise, I don't really have issues with seeing the doctor. There's only the slightest worry about what might be wrong with me.
0.238100	The potential for a negative visit usually is what bothers me the most. If I've never been to a particular doctor's office, their demeanor mostly gives me cause for worry.
0.785700	The things that make me feel most anxious is interacting with the doctor and feeling like a may be scolded. The other thing I don't like is just going to the doctor tends to make me feel a general unease. It triggers my social anxiety.
0.714300	Thoughts that there is no point to visit the doctor, I just spend time and money without any results.
0.761900	That the physician will give you a negative report/diagnosis. Doctors don't have a positive bone in their bodies. It is ALWAYS doom and gloom with them. They just  approach a patient with how the odds of getting well are so low. Their game plan is to give you a lot of medicines or advice a sometimes unnecessary surgery. Again, to make money for hospitals and drug companies.
0.500000	Not knowing what is going on or what problems might be occurring in my body. 
0.309500	i be so anxious to see things like my blood presser and worried if it going to be high 
0.523800	Now that I am 64 I cannot help but worry about what the doctor may find; if there is some condition or clue that I am not even aware about, but may lead me down a serious path of health treatments and expenses. I think I am actually more worried about the possible fincial consequences than the physical discomfort.
0.238100	I'm a anxious person in general. But when I go to the doctor am a little more anxious I think just because I'm afraid she might find something bad, like cancer.
0.738100	The hope that nothing bad comes out of the exam.  I go to an exam if I think something might need to be checked, or for bloodwork ect.  Its always a worry that something will maybe be wrong.  
0.428600	Not knowing if everything's gon be okay or if there's some issue the doctor might discover that I didn't know about.
0.309500	I feel anxious and worried because I don't know what the doctor will tell me after examining me.
0.404800	during an exam, you do not know what could be found, so that is nerve wracking
0.952400	The thing I worry about most when seeing my doctor is potentially finding out that I have a serious problem and will need surgery. Just the thought of surgery terrifies me!
0.666700	I do feel anxious at times that they won't know what is wrong with me or it will cost a lot of money to heal me.
0.761900	The idea of receiving bad health news or finding out that there was something extremely wrong with me or my health.
0.238100	The potential for being diagnosed with something serious, I suppose.
0.690500	I always worry that the doctor will find that something is wrong with me and I wouldn't even suspect.
0.404800	Even though i am calm with my doctor,  it's always an anxious time as you never know if something could be found wrong. 
0.714300	I suppose that it's fear of the unknown.  As I get older I hear about all of the various health issues the others have experienced and I worry that something serious will happen to me. 
0.500000	I have several chronic pain and breathing issues.  I'm always concerned that one of these issues may evolve into something that may become very serious.  I don't like surgery and I don't like hospitals, and I'm always concerned that either may become necessary.
0.452400	Mostly I worry if my health is improving or backsliding. I have a silly worry that he will find some horrible disease or something. I mean, not really, but kind of if that makes sense. I also don't like getting shots. Or the backside exam.
0.142900	Not knowing what the doctor will tell me. Uncertainty of the situation.
0.785700	I'm always afraid they will discover some terrible new disease I have to go with the ones I currently experience. 
0.785700	You never know if your next physical could be the one that you find out that you have cancer or some other life-crippling ailment.
0.142900	I worry that they might find something that I didn't know about and it is very serious.
0.452400	my doctor takes hours to come into the office to see me. that makes me really anxious because sometimes i have other things to do that day. also, i just met him so i get anxious about describing all my issues to him.
0.142900	I dont get anxious or worried when visiting a dr office.  There is literally no point in adding stress.
0.714300	Unless I am having a routine visit then there is always a chance that I could have a serious problem. Even when having a routine visit there is that chance, but it is more worrisome when the problem is not something you have normally dealt with. In my case I have a condition that will generally get worse as I age and I am anxious because I may get information that I have gotten worse instead of staying the same. 
0.547600	I feel most anxious or worried at a doctors office wondering if they will listen without being brushed off or ridiculed. They tend to be dismissive when realizing I am not able to tolerate medicine, and rather than researching to find the root cause I often feel brushed off or abandoned. I get anxious or worried because I'm obviously visiting the office for a valid reason and wish they would take a moment and try to help find or recommend an altertive solution. 
0.333300	I am hoping that I get a clean bill of health from my check ups. You never know what a doctor might find. It produces anxiety in me regarding possible health problems arising.
0.214300	What makes me most anxious is now knowing what the doctor might find, that is medically wrong with me, during the office visit.
0.476200	Diabetes runs in my family.  I want to make sure that I never get that disease ever in my life. I'm always anxious at the thought of the doctor telling me that I have diabetes whenever I come in. 
0.642900	I feel like I am not going to remember to share all my concerns or that if I bring them up the doctor will think they are stupid. My husband recently brought up concerns I had over a procedure that he needed done and he said the doctor literally said the concern was stupid. 
0.142900	I don't typically feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office.  I know my body and my health very well.  Visits to the doctor's office, up to this point in my life, have been relatively event free.
0.595200	I feel anxious about the exam itself and not speaking well. I get nervous and shy to talk to anyone I do not know well and sometimes stumble over my words. I also get worried over what the prognosis will be. 
0.642900	Even if nothing feels wrong, I'll get nervous that I've got some major health issue that I wasn't aware of. I'm in my late 30's, and although I'm in pretty good health now, I'm always afraid that issues of some sort are just around the corner for me. 
0.190500	I will feel worried if i have some health issue since long and will be waiting for the reports from the doctor.
0.619000	Just the thought that something serious could be wrong.  The thought I might catch something from the other sick people.  That I might have to have some kind of treatment.  That I might have to have a shot.
0.404800	It is uncomfortable to have someone examine my body, that is essentially a stranger, so intimately . It is uncomfortable no matter how often it occurs.
0.571400	that there is something seriously wrong.. 
0.714300	The unknown of what they might find from running test.
0.690500	Getting on the scale and being told that my blood levels are normal when I am having symptoms related to a condition I am on medication for. Also,  an abnormal mammogram, even though it has been a false finding every time.
0.476200	just what to expect from a check up.Just thinking what if they find something wrong with me.
0.238100	WHat makes me feel most anxious is just the overall doctor visit which I always find unpleasant.
0.857100	I'm worried that they will find something wrong with me. I hold my breath until they tell me everything is okay.
0.785700	They could find that i have a dangerous health issue. 
0.285700	I feel most anxious or worried because I felt feared.
0.428600	I worry that there could be something more wrong with many than there really is.
0.214300	Being in hospitals. The sounds, the smell, the sights. I guess it goes back to when I was young, every time I went to the doctor as a kid something was wrong. I guess some of that anxiety cared over to my adult years. 
0.500000	I don't know, really. I'm not scared, just nervous. 
0.857100	I'm not sure I can change what will happen. I really don't need to know the answer to many questions I can't afford to treat in the way I would need to do. most problems go away if you can not worry about them long enough.
0.285700	
0.666700	I am always worried that the doctor will discover something that could lead to something complicated and unwanted.
1.000000	Im afraid that the doctor lacks the basic knowledge to access the condition and prescribe appropriate treatment.I worry that the individual may be more concerned about fincial gains rather than offering sound judgement.
0.714300	Whether they are going to find something wrong and try to pressure me into some 'treatment' which will suppress symptoms and interfere with my body's attempts to heal and rebalance. I really wish that I could find a holistic practitioner who could help me live a tural and healthy lifestyle, making the most of traditiol medical knowledge and modern medicine. 
0.976200	The whole thing is anxiety producing and nerve-wracking. One of the primary contributors to these negative feelings involves my persol knowledge of how physicians frequently behave, think, and act i.e. their utter lack of genuine care or concern for patients, their tendency to essentially ignore patients and just drone on about whatever they would like to, and their tendency to behave like patients are a burden and infringing on their time. 
0.619000	the uncertain of your health or finding some bad news about you
0.857100	I'm worried that they won't look for what is wrong with me and think it is all in my head. I'm scared they might find something bad wrong with me and I'm terrified of having painful procedures and tests done. 
0.500000	I just don't like waiting. I am in pretty good health so I'm not really worried that something terrible is going to turn up. I am always a bit anxious to find out my weight since I have struggled with it in the past. 
0.881000	Examitions require a level of persol interaction that I am very uncomfortable with. I usually only go when I am sick so I am already worried. 
0.285700	I never feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. Even if the appointment is to discuss test results. I am confident if that there is a health issue of concern, my doctor has researched the best possible demerits to present to me.
0.619000	I feel anxious or worried the most when I am sick and go to the doctors. I feel like I may receive some bad news sometimes. It's just an atmosphere where you are not sure if everything will be okay. But I trust my doctor so I am not entirely anxious. 
0.142900	Nothing really.  I like my nurse practitioner and feel like I don't mind going to the doctor's office when needed. 
0.428600	"The lack of concern for my health commonly demonstrated by the doctor. The assumption that I am an ignorant person without the capacity to understand what is being said to me. (That said, having done technical support for years, I can understand that attitude. ""My computer has a big blue screen that says I done somethin' illegal, but I didn't! It's all paid for, legal."" Yes, this is a real event.)"
0.714300	"I've had a bout with thyroid cancer so every doctor visit I think ""what's next?"" and how much will each referral and testing diagnostic cost. It worries me emotiolly and fincially."
0.333300	Just the fact that I have to go the doctor at all. I have been sick for a while so it just makes me nervous to be there at all, and a little anxious but I know I feel a bit better now, so it is getting better with the axiety.
0.619000	Often times it's the possibility of having to argue with them about what would be a better treatment for ME. There are certain meds that just aren't necessary, and I hate that I have to go in with the mindset of having to be my own advocate and ready for mild confrontation. A doctor should have my best interest in mind and not just what is easy or done out of habit for them. I also worry I won't be listened to when I try to do my due diligence to list ALL symptoms pertaining to whatever is ailing me. 
0.547600	usually what they may or may not find. You never know what problems you could have until you get an examition. I usually trust their skills and judgment and that they'll do their job well though. 
0.904800	I worry they will perform a painful procedure.  I worry they will recommend that I have a painful procedure.  I am anxious about rather or not they will listen to my needs, concerns and rather or not they will spend enough time with me.
0.785700	when my brainscans come back and I'm finding out the results
0.690500	I get worried that I will have to get shots. I've had a phobia of them for a while
0.500000	The fact of going there just sparks tural anxiety. I don't want to face any underlying issues. I don't worry too much but just want to be sure all is well. 
0.238100	I don't often feel anxious or worried about going to the doctor.  The only thing that might make me uneasy is the possibility of them discovering I had a life threatening illness.
0.690500	Usually any procedure that involves the doctor inspecting private areas makes me worried.  I don't feel comfortable with that at all.
0.381000	I think it is just the fact of the unknown. Everyone comes across health issues at some point in their life and im just nervous waiting for mine. Worrying that my blood test will come back abnormal or the doctor will hear something in my lungs or see a lump somewhere. 
0.761900	I don't know the person and I feel vulnerable. I don't like talking to stranger or having strangers touch me.
0.523800	I am very paranoid about my health. The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried is me thinking about what could be wrong and what the doctor will tell me. I am always afraid he is going to give me horrible news.
0.881000	If there Is something wrong with my health. If I have to take any long term medication. The process of getting better if there is an illness.
0.666700	I am not sure why I feel like this. It is a general feeling that I have always had. Probably mostly the smell and the idea that I will be in pain ( a shot or a pap smear).  And then recently just frustrated that the doctor will treat me like my situation is stupid.
0.238100	I have no problem visiting the doctor's office. Other than the occasiol...I have absolutely no bedside manner doctor, I find doctors very accommodating. I however, hate Pap smears. Unless you've had one you can't possibly understand. So...no problems with going for physical other than pap and a small aversion to needles.
0.809500	I am most worried about finding out bad news about my health when visiting the doctor. More than that I worry about any treatment I may need. I worry about any physical pain I might have to endure and how I will pay for it. Since I can't afford it and my insurance isn't adequate, I worry because I know I probably won't receive proper treatment. 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when visiting the doctor
0.523800	One of my biggest concerns with visiting a doctor's office involve receiving bad news or being treated too quickly and the doctor not doing a full job. As patients we sometimes wait long periods to see the doctor, so the idea we can be pushed out fast is worrisome.
0.166700	I am made most anxious by having to bare my body during physical examitions. A doctor has never made me feel uncomfortable about this...I just am.
0.642900	I just worry the possibility that they find something wrong with me. I'm never worried about the doctor doing anything wrong or making mistakes. I don't have the healthiest lifestyle so I expect bad news when I visit the doctor.
0.500000	Unless I am really ill I don't feel anxious. The one thing that worries me most is when a doctor briefly feels for breast lumps, although that's done so quickly there's not much chance of it. So the chance of having cancer of some kind makes me most worried.
0.142900	I don't get anxious about visiting the doctor in the same way that I don't get anxious when shopping for groceries or getting an oil change.
0.714300	I am just always worried they'll find something crazy bad with my health.
0.571400	I feel that the doctor might find something that is bad like a health condition or a disease that I have recently developed.
0.142900	i don't like waiting for results especially if it was for something that might be serious. 
0.142900	Not right now. I look forward to makeing sure I am staying healthy now. 
0.690500	"Feeling as though the physician doesn't have the time to ""deal"" with you.  Questions not answered, followup not proper.  "
0.809500	I worry that something could be found to be wrong with my heart. Sometimes my blood pressure is higher than it should be when they test it. I worry that the doctor will think I am faking the physical pain and anxiety I feel so that I can get drugs from it.
0.547600	I feel anxious because I am a person that is reserved. I am quiet so it is hard to open up to somebody. 
0.857100	Oftentimes, the silence that hangs in the air from other patients. 
0.857100	I think lack of trust is a big issue. I'm also squeamish about needles and other procedures. Also, bad memories about my parents' medical treatment.
0.761900	I'm not sure if I know.  It seems to be an automatic reaction.  It may be in part that I don't want to be told that I need to make major changes in my lifestyle.
0.952400	Number one is that they will find something wrong even if I am there to treat something minor.  I will be nervous and worried and then it will most likely be nothing, a mistake.  Or the treatment will do nothing for me.
0.285700	Just the activity of going to visit a doctor for them to possibly tell you something about your body you may not know. The experience in and of itself is a little bit nerve wracking.
0.333300	My biggest fear would be a diagnosis which revealed some serious medical condition which I was uware of.
0.452400	Worried because just in case doctor told me something bad about my health condition.
0.619000	I am afraid I will get bad news.
0.761900	That they will find something wrong with me that is very harmful and that would be life changing. Today going to get checked by a doctor with all the things that can go wrong is a very stressful thing.
1.000000	I feel worried each time I visit my doctor because I feel he's going to add me on more medication. He said that my blood pressure continues to increase. The medicine that I'm on already makes me feel dizzy at times. I don't want to be placed on more medication. 
0.333300	The thing that makes me most anxious is waiting to find out If I have a disease that can kill me like diabetes or cancer. Another thing that can make me a bit anxious is having a rectal exam, as it is very uncomfortable.
0.785700	Gynecological examition makes me so anxious and worried because first thing you have to show your private parts, second the thought about the test results.
0.857100	When I sense that the doctor has their own agenda rather than responding to the patient in front of them, it makes me very anxious. When the doctor exhibits arrogant behavior or seems disrespectful, I worry that they won't really listen to me or will discount what I have to tell them. When a doctor seems to assume that every patient is displaying drug-seeking behavior, I worry that they aren't really listening and that I will not get the right treatment.
0.809500	I'm afraid of receiving bad news about my health
0.452400	As this hardly ever occurs, well, ... hard to say. However, most times (very few), I've mostly felt more neutral, than anxious. Any anxiety would be related to waiting time.
0.285700	The only thing that worries me is if I am sick, and I am worried that the doctor will have bad news as to the sickness.  I worry that the cure for the ailment would be traumatic or painful; like if I needed surgery.
0.238100	Not knowing what the results of tests or an examition might be. It makes me a little nervous,not knowing what to expect.
0.571400	The thing that worries me the most is that there will be costs I'm not aware of to the visit. We are on a very fixed income and a lot of times there are additiol fees tacked onto bills that I wasn't expecting. Sometimes it's because I asked a question, which is frustrating.
0.928600	The idea that I might have something else to add to the pile of illnesses I have. Or that with my Sjogren's since I'm more likely to get lymphoma will it show up, especially since cancer runs in my family.
0.595200	I feel like I'm being judged
0.809500	When I visit a doctor's office, my biggest fer or worry is a negative diagnosis. It is basically the fear of the unknown or the uncertainty of it. 
0.381000	We all want to avoid bad news and pain
0.619000	I think doctors often seem to guess at what is going on with their patients, though it is an informed guess, they may not be making a careful assessment of their patients health and rely a little too heavily on previous experience to the extent where they may not recognize or are dismissive of other symptoms. They can often seem resigned to a bad outcome, and at the same time be uninformative about what is going on.
0.428600	"The only time I might feel anxious or worried with visiting my doctor would be, the not ""Knowing"" what's wrong. Not wanting to hear any dreadful news."
0.238100	I don't want to feel anxious, but there is something about me that is turally anxious. I know this about myself because my BP reading inflates every time I go for a checkup.  I feel I am this way even in social situations although no one takes my BP under those circumstances.  
0.142900	I only get anxious sometimes in the waiting room because I get social anxiety. 
0.476200	I worry that I may have underestimated the seriosness of my condition. There is usually also the worry that the doctor might find something wrong with me that I did not even suspect.
0.404800	waiting for my appointment is a very stressful situation. The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
0.333300	I always feel a little anxious when someone has to look at my ked body. I also worry that being anxious will throw off my blood pressure readings, I have low blood pressure, and want to keep it that way. I hate getting on the scales as I know my weight is not great for my height. I am always a little anxious when the blood results are given to me. I want to be in excellent health and if I am not I want the doctor to tell me it is something that can be changed by diet or medication.
0.714300	Although I try my best to keep myself healthy, I never know what a medical check-up will bring. I'm just an anxious person in general, so it's hard for me to sit still when someone else has information about me that I don't know. The anxiety comes from wanting to make certain that I'm physically and interlly OK.
0.761900	The number one reason for anxiety when going to a doctor is the cost. I fear they are going to recommend something I can not afford.Or find some form of cancer or something.
0.595200	I am worried about what might be wrong with me.  I worry that it might be really serious.
0.547600	Well, I'm 38, so I just don't want any unwanted surprises. :-) 
0.214300	The time necessary to identify and appropriately mage health issues sometimes worries me, as I do not feel that I can trust my PCP or any other single doctor individually.   I have had too many bad experiences in maging my own care, and that of various family members.
0.238100	Just having to know what really is going on with me can be a source of worry. It's always uncertain until the doctor gives you confirmation of what's really going on with you. Until I know, I am waiting and that makes me anxious. And obviously depending on what I end up learning about, that can make me even more anxious.
0.690500	Wondering if they will they get frustrated. Will this be fruitless and a waste of money. Can they help me.
0.761900	I am usually worried that he will discover something that is drastically wrong with my health.
0.547600	What makes me feel the most concerned about visiting a doctor's office is that they likely don't know what to do, but will gladly try a few things that will end up costing way too much. A person is lucky if they don't end up feeling worse, being told there's nothing wrong, and/or walking away having to take a bunch of expensive pills. No, thank you.
0.833300	I worry that something is seriously wrong.
0.166700	The doctor is not totally alert. Wrong diagnosis. Visiting a doctor for the first time.
0.619000	I am anxious when my mother is there with me. She will ask questions and sometimes , when the physician asks me a question, she will pop in with her input before I speak.
0.381000	I'm frequently worried that I won't be able to correctly explain my problem, or mess it up so that he won't fully believe me. It's also worrisome that doctors frequently prescribe things that you know isn't what you need.
0.619000	I guess, just the possibility that something could be wrong, or that the doctor will try to steer me down a path I don't totally agree with. However, it's best to address any issue asap. 
0.571400	If there would be something in the results that was unexpected and it would create some anxiety
0.142900	Just waiting for test results for days instead of getting them the same day of 
0.142900	just the office in general, the coldness , and waiting
0.142900	None so far as I have been taking care of my health on my own. My routine medical checkup has been good and when I do need to see my physician periodically it was more on getting the flu shots or some mild illness.
0.333300	when its a dental checkup i feel anxious.
0.666700	Generally, when you enter a doctor's office, it's either to receive treatment or advice regarding an existing issue or concern.  The best case scerio when going is that nothing is wrong, or it is not as serious as suspected.  The anxiousness or worry stems from the altertive scerio, that the issue is more serious, the issue requires additiol treatment, and the issue may not only affect my future health, but could include significant out of pocket costs.
0.357100	That there may be some serious condition with me
0.261900	if I have an extreme illness and it may be caught too late
0.761900	It's just a part of my persolity. I am an anxious person. I sometimes feel worried that there will be something wrong with me.
0.785700	I feel most anxious or worried about any possible negative diagnosis or treatments that might be advised to take (especially if invasive). Just the initial feeling of not knowing what is going on or what the problem is is already enough to cause a general feeling of anxiety. Some testing (and not just treatments) are also worrisome (fear of needles... I go through it, but I still hate any type of needles/pin pricks, etc.).
0.428600	I am most anxious or worried because of the possibility of finding something medical problem with my health
0.523800	finding out something wrong could make me feel a little anxious or worried but in general I prefer to know.
0.809500	That they'll look down on me and brand me a drug seeker, or not believe what I'm telling them.
0.928600	It is just uncomfortable.  It is not something you do everyday so when the time comes for an appointment it makes me anxious.  I worry about gaining weight or my blood work numbers not being in the range they should be.
0.285700	Having to weigh myself in the beginning. 
0.500000	I'm always anxious because I go when I have a problem, not just to visit.
0.714300	In the back or my mind there is always that idea that I could have some life altering disease that the Doctor will discover.  Because of my family history, I have a fear that I will develop some sort of cancer, and he'll find it, and tell me I'm termil. 
0.476200	The thing that makes me most anxious is wondering if there will be something majorly wrong. I also worry that there won't be anything that can be done for symptoms that may be present.
0.142900	The needle if i have to get a shot!

0.928600	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing what the doctor may or may not find. Even if I'm feeling fine and believe that I'm healthy, you just never know. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac, so in the back of my mind, I think I'm always think there couldbe something wrong. 
0.642900	I am worried the doctor will find something that is wrong with me and that I have health problems I wasn't aware of.
0.285700	Whenever anyone goes to the doctors, we are going at our most vulnerable state. We think there's something wrong with us. We always await the worse news. But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's not as scary as I thought.
0.571400	When I have to get a cancer screening or something of that nature done. I really get worried when my kids or loved ones visit the doctor to be honest.
0.333300	If I know I have to get blood drawn I will get very nervous and have a panic attack, I do not like needles and that makes me anxious, otherwise I never have many issues while visiting the doctors office.
0.357100	I feel anxious that they'll find something else wrong with me. I hope that I'm doing the right things and that I don't walk away with unexplained tests or something else that I need to watch out for. 
0.619000	Just the unknown of what is going to happen.  No one wants to get shots or have to draw blood, or find out something looks strange on you.  Those things would make anyone anxious and nervous.
0.142900	I am mostly anxious about the diagnosis. I also get anxious about being left in the examination room for a long period of time before getting seen. It almost becomes claustrophobic to the point that I need to get up and open the door.
0.142900	I feel that I will receive false or very bad news from my doctor. I have seen doctors give patients wrong information which led to worsened health. 
0.142900	I would feel anxious visiting the doctor if I had something going on that was scaring me or that was something major that was wrong with me. Sometimes I worry that if I go in for something that it won't be solved.
0.619000	I feel a little afraid that the doctor will find something wrong with me tat i didnt even know about yet. As i get older i know parts of my body will not function correctly and im anticipating that on a visit
0.571400	I have anxiety so just going to meet with someone I do not know well in a public place automatically causes me to feel anxious and worried. Couple that with it relating to my health it is more severe.
0.428600	I do not experience anxiety ot worry very much about going to the doctor.  For me, it is more worrying when I can do it between work, kids, homelife, etc.
1.000000	i feel like the doctors are not being honest with me and saying that I am not healthy just so they can prescribe me a bunch of baloney. I have been depressed and very anxious for a while and wanted to bring it up to the doctor but feared they would force me to take pills or force medication for the sake of them gaining money rather than helping me which makes me step back and not want to visit the doctor unless I absolutely have to. 
0.714300	As I get older and feel more aches and pains I'm worried that he'll find a tumor or some organ failure or some bone turning to dust or some incurable disease.
0.595200	Oh there's always the worry they'll find something that ends up being deadly cancer or something. I'm also worried about having to do the prostate thing because I'm getting to the age where it's going to happen so I'm a bit anxious about that.
0.285700	The feeling that you could have an underlying condition that is not effecting your quality of life but could. You would only find that out when visiting the doctor and being examined. 
0.595200	I get anxious sometimes because you never know what is going to found or if something could go wrong. It is not a guarantee that everything will be checked to be fine.
0.309500	I sometimes get nervous about talking about an embarrassing symptom that I might be experiencing, or I get worried that an serious illness might be diagnosed in tests. 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when visiting my doctor's office.  The staff are always very nice and make me feel comfortable, and my doctor has fantastic bedside manner that makes me feel at ease.  The only thing I would feel worried about is not knowing what's wrong with me.
0.142900	Mostly I'm anxious if something is wrong with me and I don't know what it is. If I'm waiting for test results or something, the not knowing is the worst part of it. Other than that, I don't really feel anxious
0.309500	Just being there is sometimes unsettling. It is hard to keep bad thoughts out when you are surrounded by sick people and the smell of a doctor's office. However, I know that my health is separate from others, so I try to keep the bad thoughts out by focusing on myself first. I get a little uneasy when waiting for test results or after an exam, but I know that I can get over it quickly.
0.571400	I always get anxious that the doctor will criticize me in some way or blame me. I also get anxious that I will receive bad news and require more medical care that is outside my financial budget.
0.309500	My greatest fear is that they will not listen or take serious my myriad of chronic and acute illnesses. They seem to often deal with my main issue that I came in for, but don't want to give me the time to deal with the other smaller yet still importan reasons I came in.
0.333300	Whenever I am worried about visiting a doctor it is due to what I am in there for. I am worried something could be wrong with me and it will be a long and expensive process if something is considerably wrong with me. 
0.357100	Sometimes I feel anxious or nervous when I'm getting a physical exam by a physician because I'm worried they will find something wrong. 
0.142900	Nothing. I don't worry about it. I don't think anyone really does. It's such a normal part of people's lives like putting gas in a car
0.881000	Like I ALREADY wrote, I don't like waiting.  I want to get crappy situations done with as soon as possible so I'm not sitting around dreading and thinking about the worst case scenario.
0.619000	I am sometimes afraid that there will be something seriously wrong with me. I sometimes dread hearing the worst, but so far, it has always turned out just fine. 
0.619000	When I go to the doctor, I often think if I happen to have something that is not yet discovered in me as those silent diseases that makes me feel anxious
0.428600	I feel the most anxious or worried about what the unknown could be when I visit the doctor for an illness other than a cold. I wonder what could be the cause and if it is something serious. 
0.285700	I don't have a good track record with caring, thoughtful doctors. Most tend to disregard what I say or think about whatever's happening to me. In addition, I have a poorly understood chronic disease (CFS/ME) that many doctors refuse to even admit exist, despite overwhelming new information that it is a biological illness.
0.142900	I actually never get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. The doctor is there to make sure I am well. There is no hidden motive involved. They provide a service and I am generally alright with the service I personally receive. 
0.642900	When I've read online about symptoms. I always expect the worst and then I worry that the Doctor will confirm what I read.
0.285700	I get most worried about the doctor not being able to find a diagnosis for what is wrong with me. I have had some health problems in the past that I have had a hard time finding a diagnosis for. This means more waiting and more doctor's visits in the future.
0.285700	I only feel anxious when I know there's something wrong with me or I feel terribly ill. When I'm feeling that way, I start worrying that I might have something serious.
0.809500	I am worried about getting bad news.  I also worry about being embarrassed or feeling awkward.  Usually it is the fear of bad news that worries me the most.
0.142900	Just the waiting process. i do not like to be in a room full of strangers waiting to be seen by a doctor. Other than that, i am completely comfortable with it and do not have any problems at all. 
0.476200	I feel anxious or worried because I feel like I can predict what they are going to say. They are going to talk about how I need to lose 20 pounds and they will ask me questions about my lifestyle and recommend ways to lose weight.  It is a sensitive topic for me and I just don't want to talk about it, let alone with a stranger.
0.571400	when we visiting the doctor it would be very difficult to seem it.It would be very fair of it.Getting a treatment it would be very important of it
0.571400	I never know what to expect. My family has a history of cancer, so I'm always afraid that routine scans or checkups will result in them finding something that shouldn't be there. I'm concerned that I won't know how to react to what they tell me, or that  they won't find something until it's too late. 
0.619000	Your doctor should listen to your answers and offer you suggestions for managing your anxiety symptoms. A family doctor, however, does not specialize in mental health conditions and may not be qualified to treat you. He should provide referrals to psychiatrists or psychologists in your area that are better qualified to work with you and create a treatment plan for you.
0.285700	my psa count as it is an indication of cancer. thankfully mine is normal and has been everytime taken. but it is the test i worry most about though i think my dr is more worried about bp
0.833300	I am an anxious person in general, and medical stuff makes me especially anxious. I think my fear is that the doctor will tell me that I have a serious health problem that I didn't know I had. I worry a lot about those types of things.
0.476200	I always worry what they might find. I have a history of cancer and diabetes in my family and I am always concerned that is going to become a issue in my life as well. I guess that is what I am most worried about, something that I can not control happening and altering my life.
0.619000	I worry that something about my health will be wrong. I'm afraid that I will have a terrible health issue, or even something minor but inconvenient. I think about how I'm a bit overweight and that is going to eventually cause health issues. I wonder if this appointment will be the one where I find out that my weight has caused some issues.
0.785700	That they'll find something wrong with me or something like that or tests will come back positive....
0.357100	I am more worried about getting the news than I am after I have received the news and know how to take care of the situation.
0.142900	I worst fear is that of catching a cold or flu from someone else that does not take the same needed precautions as I do. for example, washing hands.
0.309500	I just don't like being at the doctors.  I always remember what happened with the Tuskegee men's study and I'm worried about how doctors can abuse their power.
0.333300	I'm a pretty calm person and I don't get too nervous - but when at the doctor's for a problem I do sometimes have in the back of my head the idea that I might be really sick, or he might find a problem, or I might hear difficult news.  So I get a little uneasy and uncomfortable sometimes due to the unknown but not too bad.
0.642900	I just get anxious that something could be wrong with me that I dont know about. You never know what your bloodwork will come back saying
0.857100	i think it's the fear of finding out you have some sort of illness / disease that you weren't aware of before. i am especially nervous about blood test results
0.690500	I just generally don't like interacting with people on a very personal level.  I don't like to be touched, I like to be private.  Getting undressed in front of a stranger in a strange place and having them poke and prod and examine me asking personal questions is semi traumatic.  
0.619000	I am usually nervous about what they will tell me that I have.  The last thing you want to hear when you see the doctor about having headaches is that you have brain cancer.  I seem to always think the worst.
0.476200	I just don't like doctors offices or hospitals in general.  I have never had any health issues so I am not afraid something is wrong with me.  I just have never liked them.
0.142900	If I have a problem that I'm unsure what it is. Everyone is always scared of the what seems like the inevitable. The inevitable is the big C word. Cancer. Either we die from a heart related problem or cancer most likely. It's just a matter of time.

0.357100	What makes me feel most anxious at the doctor's office is, by far, getting immunizations. While I agree to get any that are recommended, even ones that aren't strictly required by the office or by my college because I believe in taking any health precautions available to me, I am very afraid of needles and get almost pancicked when I need to have a shot.
0.190500	Nothingg at the moment.  I'm mostly healthy expect for my weight from drinking habits.  I started having random pain that was constant and moderate to serve I would worry about what the diagnosis is at that point.
0.285700	I would only feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctor's if I thought I had something serious wrong with me. If I thought I had a serious disease or a potentially embarrassing disease, then I would be worried. 
0.666700	One thing that makes me feel most anxious is the fact that there might be something wrong with me. That worries me, and I stress out about it.
0.285700	I get worried and anxious when I'm not sure if my problems will require some kind of procedure or if I will get a diagnosis I don't want to hear (like having cancer). The doctor herself doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or nervous, it is the consequences related to my problems that make we worried.
0.523800	I am not sure what it is. I guess I am introverted so sitting in a quiet room with someone I donât know well is uncomfortable. Also I donât want them to think I am seeking drugs 
0.333300	I know I am going to feel foolish saying this but I absolutely hate getting shots. It's not the pain that it causes but rather the mental build-up of thinking of the needle going in you and all the blood.
0.595200	I feel worried about whether I can get my questions answered and whether I can get the care I need. I have at times not received the treatment I feel I needed or the correct medicines when I have needed them. 
0.690500	That they will tell me something bad that I do not want to hear, that I am not in good health. I worry that it will be something that I haven't been doing right. 
0.190500	I have anxiety, and going to do anything where I am being examined bothers me to some extent. I don't worry about any potential problems, it's just general anxiety.
0.285700	I think the worst part of it is just the waiting and the anxiety that provides to you, not knowing what might happen or what is wrong with you
0.690500	I am always a bit anxious with doctor appointments. I think that there is just that factor of the unknown that makes people worry. 
0.261900	I don't. I feel relaxed and I don't care. They are people just like me, and if they are trying to do their best for me, I don't have to worry about what is going on.
0.285700	I'm generally not a person that worries much about anything. Unless, I am in a great deal of pain or agony, I'm confident that there's nothing seriously wrong with me. Now, if there's every an instance where I'm experiencing great pain and the doctor can't figure out why, then that would make me anxious.
0.428600	When I am waiting to be told what is wrong, because you are left in a room alone for a decent amount of time. Your mind seems to wonder off and start thinking of everything that could be wrong. 
0.714300	I just get the feelings that I would expect most people to get.  If you're at the doctor then something must be wrong.  I just want to get it over with and get out of there.  If you are having fun and enjoy visiting the doctor then something is not right with you!
0.619000	What makes me feel the most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is the unknown. Generally, when I am going to the doctor's office, I don't know what is wrong with me and I fear the worst in some circumstances.
0.785700	Sometimes the most common thing is the unknown. What if they find something wrong with me that is far worse. I would sometimes rather not know then to know something is wrong. That would be the only real fear, or worry is finding out something that might be truly wrong.
0.142900	I would feel most anxious about any test results I may be getting back.  I would also be a little anxious about the potential that something may be very wrong and I would need an extended hospital stay.
0.571400	I'm the most anxious when I have no clue what could be causing my problem or if the doctor or nurse doesn't seem to know either. Also I get anxious if I anticipate bad news.
0.595200	I experience this as many times. When I want to saw the doctor, at that time he come to office too late or leave. This behavior is the worst behavior of the Doctor's attitude. This is very wrong action. 
0.190500	Being diagnosed with cancer would have to be my number one worry, even though I have never been diagnosed with it before, its just a really worry for me, and I do things in my life to try to avoid this diagnosis.
0.761900	Being able to adequately explain my concerns, anticipating the response of the doctor, being ignored or talked down to, the actual physical exam also makes me anxious because I don't like being touched.
0.785700	The fear that I've not taken care of myself well enough and it will result in a malady that I could have avoided.  The prospect of not being well for my children.
0.881000	When I visit a doctors office the thing that makes me the most anxious is worrying about getting a shot.  For my entire life, I have absolutely been terrified of needles and getting shots.  Each time I go to a doctors office this thought and idea continuously races through my mind and I find myself often sweating and shaking out of nervousness for no reason.  Also when I visit a doctors office, I worry about how much the visit is going to cost and what is actually wrong with me .
1.000000	i am an anxious nervous sort of person. no matter what it is. grocery shopping. walking down the street, appointments. im always scared and on guard. 
0.619000	I sometimes feel like I am being judged by my doctor. Also, I am anxious that I will be misdiagnosed again. 
0.309500	I really can't think of anything, other that coming in one day and finding out a have a NEW doctor that I wasn't informed of beforehand, especially after having gotten used to my current one.
0.952400	I worry that I will be criticized, belittled, or that they will find something significantly wrong with me, such as cancer.
0.452400	Normally, I'm pretty healthy. I think the waiting time both in the lobby and in the examination room just gives the mind enough time to overthink things and think the doctor's going to be coming back with bad news. There's just a sense of uncertainty about what might pop up.
0.976200	the unknown, not knowing what you could possibly find out about being sick. I worry about being judged by the doctors or nurses for my appearance or health care issues.
0.761900	I am always anxious because unless I am going to see the doctor for a specific problem I believe if they are looking for something they will certainly find something.  
0.452400	I'm worried mostly about two things: 1) do I have a serious long term health issue that will be revealed to me? 2) If I mention minor things that are bothering me, will the doctor thing I'm wasting his/her time?
0.309500	I don't have much anxiety or unease that I can think of.  I suppose that occasionally I am worried about what sort of diagnosis might be involved and that there could be some sort of serious condition
0.476200	I just have general anxiety when at the doctor's office. It is a general fear of sickness and I am always nervous that I am not in as good as health as I should be.
0.214300	That my blood pressure will be high when I'm getting it checked there. I take a couple of prescriptions for that and it's always lower when I test it at home vs. what the number are in the doctor's office.
0.761900	I'm always anxious that I will get some bad news about my health, especially if its something I don't see coming. I enjoy being active and feeling healthy. I wouldn't want anything to jeopardize that or to have a long/lasting effect on my family. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. However, I also would want to catch any problems as soon as possible to hopefully battle whatever it is that I have going on.
0.809500	I don't like waiting to see the doctor, and I don't like the small talk aspect of doctors in their offices. I just want a diagnosis, prescription, and to get out. I respect the medical profession but being in a waiting room full of sick people really makes me not want to go to the doctor at all. 
0.595200	Well i am worried they might find out i have some reare diease or something like that and that could have a big impact on my life and well being
0.285700	Iâm just really scared of getting hurt like receiving a shot. Iâm also scared of hearing results such as me having a bad disease or something really scary happening
0.476200	That the doctor will not believe me when I describe my symptoms - or that he will argue with me about how I feel.  
0.571400	that he isnt going to give me a proper diagnosis and just give me anything to get me in and out of the office. i am to the point where i am not going to want to go there anymore. the hospital system is fine it is just the care isnt there, 
0.809500	Obviously that there is a serious condition. I rarely go to the doctor, so if I'm there I am likely in a lot of pain and in a state of worry. So while I am there I am thinking about what could possibly be wrong.
0.714300	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is finding out that I have any major problems or issues.
0.619000	What makes me most anxious is the thought that he may give me bad news.  I particularly don't like to wait for results from test because I start to worry the results might be bad. 
0.500000	I feel most anxious about the exam, since you don't know what results the doctor will tell you about your body. Sometimes, it can be some bad news that you really didn't want to hear and it causes necessary or unnecessary stress. 
0.142900	I really don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor but I suppose I will try to explain some reasons why I might.  The first and most important would be if I am concerned about my own condition or symptoms being something way more severe than it might be.
0.738100	I am worried that they will discover something that is wrong with me. I know i am healthy but there is always a suspicion that something is wrong and they will discover it. It just more nerves about having a bad disease discovered.

0.357100	I worry most that the treatment will be invasive, or there will be a lot of negative side effects for any medication required.
0.381000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office is how much its all going to cost when its over especially if he finds something that requires further actions such as surgery or more blood work.

0.690500	I feel the most anxious about having my body examined. I am okay with getting shots I need or having blood drawn, but the thought of having a stranger touching and looking at my body makes me uncomfortable and anxious.

0.190500	i don't like being weighed so i feel somewhat anxious about getting on a scale in the doctors' office.
0.690500	sometimes it's about the health which makes me worried and sometime it is about the inability of knowledge which we can't find out about our health

0.595200	"I'm most concerned that the doctor will find something wrong with me that was clearly my fault.  It's not so much that there's something wrong with me that bothers me; it's being faulted for my lifestyle and choices.  That seems really backwards and silly, perhaps, but that's my bigger fear.  It's not them saying, ""There's something wrong with you.""  It's them saying, ""You haven't been taking care of yourself."""
0.785700	What makes me feel very anxious is probably the fact that I wont know the results until a couple weeks after the appointment. Therefore I tend to worry a lot about the results and the outcome while visiting the doctor office.
0.666700	When visiting a doctors office it's usually due to an illness or something else that is wrong with me so it makes me nervous while I'm there. I'm nervous what could be wrong and the treatment that will be provided and I'm also nervous that hopefully the doctor is correct.

0.714300	I am often worried that the doctor will not have a solution for me. Often the doctor proposes a possible solution, but rarely suggests a solution that will definitely address my problem. Because my time with the doctor often feels hurried, I am worried that all of my concerns will not get addressed. I also get anxious when I have to discuss problems that are somewhat uncomfortable or may be perceived as embarrassing for me. I also hate needles, and worry about whether the doctor will recommend a blood test.
0.285700	I feel a little anxious to know if I have good news or bad news. Obviously I am hoping for some good news, but it doesn't always turn out that way.
0.190500	That theyâre going to find something that means I have a bad disease or issue. Iâll need more medication or surgery. 
0.642900	I think I'm afarid of the what if? What if they think I have something wrong that I do not and then they mess me up for life with meds or surgery I do not need, I have seen to make people abdicated to pills to need to be that way. Plus the cost and hassle makes me out of sorts.  
0.142900	No really very worried. He is easy to talk to. He does seem to rush me out so sometimes I have to really think before i get in there. Never have to wait much.

0.500000	I am always fearful that the doctor will find some unforeseen, unusual issue of which I was not aware. I also wonder what my lungs sound like considering that although I quit smoking 5 years ago, I smoked for four decades previously.
0.595200	A lot of times my concerns and symptoms are dismissed, and I am rushed out of the office.  It feels like my doctor is only there to put out fires and deal with absolute emergencies.  With smaller issues/pains that could potentially develop into something worse, she doesn't have the energy to investigate or deal with them.  The same attitude is prevalent with other doctors I've seen.
0.285700	I hate change and fear of the unknown. Waiting is also very hard especially when waiting on routine blood work, my mind will race and come up with utterly ridiculous scenarios. I fear the negative results of what has been in my family history.
0.690500	I worry that anything I bring up in regards to my health will not be paid attention to because of my history of anxiety and will be written off as psychosomatic or as a result of my anxiety. I get anxious that they will brush things off and give me the standard lines about relaxing more, destressing, etc. I also feel anxious that they will think I'm crazy. 
0.285700	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most likely to feel anxious or worried about someone there making me sick.  I absolutely hate to be in small areas full of sick people.  If I could isolate myself in a little personal bubble/pod while in the waiting room, I would certainly not mind the doctor adding a few bucks to his rate to cover it.  Why don't you invent that and throw me a few bucks?
0.761900	i worry that something is wrong withe me. i worry that they wont know how to help me. i worry that they will tell me bad news. i worry that they will tell me i am overweight and need to lose weight. I cant go to the doctor without being told that i am overweight.

0.381000	The thing that makes me worried is that they will find something that is terribly wrong with me and I will have to have expensive tests or surgery.
0.142900	I am worried that I am just another customer and that I am the only one who truly cares. I wish medicine was a much smaller thing and that doctors practiced more independently. 
0.214300	Fear of the unknown. He might find something wrong that I don't want to know or hear about. I usually wait as long as possible before going to the doctor. We don't have a lot of money so I wait until the problems pile up and I have no other choice but to go. 
0.857100	When I am at a doctors office I am worried because I don't know what will happen. They do not converse very well about the procedures they are following. They may perform these procedures every day and seem to forget that not everyone knows what the procedure they are doing entails.
0.809500	worried that they won't take the time to answer all my questions.  Will be made to feel that I am a bother for having questions/concerns
0.285700	I just am not the kind that likes a lot of waiting. I think that it should be a quick and easy check up that comes in the office.
0.142900	I don't have at issue at all.  The only thing I don't like is like mammogram or pep smears that it could hurt.  Also fasting blood work could get me hungry.  Other than that I don't have any worry or fear.
0.666700	I don't like the impersonality there often is when being examined. It feels, sometimes, like being a car or something else that is being checked for malfunctions, rather than a person: the way you are led to a room and have to sit around waiting for the doctor, for instance. It also feels somewhat invasive to be examined in that way, and that makes me self-conscious.
0.142900	the cost or chance some of my blood work would come back showing a positive result for some unforeseen disease.
0.357100	I think what makes me feel the most nervous is learning that there might be something wrong with me that I did not know about before even going to the doctor in the first place.
0.142900	The only thing that makes me feel anxious. Is I had surgery for female reproductive problems. The surgery has a 40% failure rate and I go the doctor every 6 months to see if the procedure is still holding or not. That can be a little disconcerting because if it fails I have to have another surgery.
0.357100	I know I take good care of my health but with my families health history you just never know what results could be of a test you have. The waiting game is tough.
0.690500	I am always uneasy in a doctors office.  I have never gone there for a good time and usually good news means that they have nothing bad to tell you.  I tire of hearing I am getting old and also the rotation of doctors with the current state of health care and insurance in the country.
0.285700	I feel one never knows what may crop up, but I really don't get worried or anxious about Dr's appointments.  Perhaps a little uncomfortable because I find Dr's appointments are not really enjoyable
0.595200	You're afraid of finding out answers in case they might be bad. You're afraid of the cost. You're afraid of being embarrassed. You're afraid of being vulnerable. You're not sure what's going to happen, and there's a possibility of bad news, so you immediately only focus on the negative.
0.952400	I am usually worried about what the doctor will say. I don't want to hear any bad news. I also worry that they won't find anything when I know there is something wrong. There have been times where my doctor would say that I was fine, but I knew I wasn't. I also am anxious about what type of tests they will do. My biggest fear is blood work. I usually know when I am getting it, but I always hope they won't do it. 
0.381000	I am always concerned about discovering I have a sickness, or being lied to by my doctor in some way
0.571400	I am pretty much constantly in pain or having some symptom or another, but I do not like to bring this up, even to the doctor. It was not looked well upon by my family growing up. You just toughed your way through things without whining. I would be worried that I would bring up a concern and it would not have any real medical basis and I would feel like I was complaining about nothing. 
0.309500	Whenever I'm visiting the doctors office I feel like I tend to get the most anxious whenever I have to be weighed. I also get a little bit anxious whenever I'm sitting in the exam room and have to wait for the doctor to walk in because I just want to know what's going on with me as soon as possible and having to wait just makes me feel like I'm on pins and needles and I start to get worried that it could end up being something worse than what I'm expecting it to be that's going on with me.
0.190500	What usually concerns me most is how much it is going to cost. Though I have insurance the bill can sometimes still be considerable.
0.881000	I am concerned that I am broken that there is something wrong with my body that is not fixable or is not responding to treatment. This anxiety resonates with me every single day, but is at its highest when I am getting an exam at the doctor's office.
0.547600	I feel anxious or worried he is going to diagnose me with some untreatable illness that I will have for my entire lifetime. He also always tells me to quit smoking which sucks but is also necessary for my health.
0.381000	When I don't know if I've collected enough symptoms through tracking to be able to get a diagnosis. A diagnosis is hard to get, but once you have one, you can make a plan and do something about the problem. I hate knowing something's wrong but not being able to get help for it, and every time I go to the doctor with a problem, I'm afraid it's going to happen again.
0.619000	If I am going to the doctor for a health problem I can get a little anxious nervous and scared. I have a habit of always fearing the worst.
0.142900	What makes me anxious when going to the doctor is maybe finding out something that is worse then what i thought
0.428600	I feel anxious mostly because of just the uncertainty of what I  might find out, I think I go with the attitude to expect the worse. I also get upset because of having to wait for the doctor to do the exam, The waiting builds up my anxiety.
0.738100	I worry the most about my health being worse than the previous time that I saw him. I get anxious that he can tell that I have not been following his guidelines perfectly in regards to taking care of my personal health.
0.142900	I think i'm pretty healthy, my doctor says so. So i don't really fell worried or anxious visiting him. Basically it's just the routine checkup, what can go wrong? 
0.333300	I do not feel anxious at all when visiting a doctors office for normal reasons. They tend to be good at diagnosing and treating conventional illnesses. I just do not trust them with anything beyond that really. The only other reason I may be anxious is if it is flu season. The last two times I have had the flu, I caught it at the doctors office seeking treatment for something else. 
0.142900	If I'm just going for a regular check-up, I'm not worried at all. However, if something is bothering me, I tend to think the worst, so I do get anxious. It usually turns out to be nothing, and I've worried my self for no reason, but that's my personality. I'm always worried that whatever I'm dealing with is something bad. It can never be simple.
0.642900	That I could potentially find something wrong with my body or something that's out of sync, whether it be blood pressure or even my weight. I feel like if something could go wrong, even a small chance, it's something that I'll think about.
0.547600	It depends on the doctor and the reason for the visit. If I have to go to the gynecologist, it's stressful due to the extreme invasion of privacy. I'm normally not anxious when going to my primary care doctor, unless I have to provide a blood sample. I have an extreme fear of needles.
0.976200	I normally have a lot of anxiety when seeing a doctor not necessarily because I am worried the doctor will not be good enough, but because I am afraid about the uncertainty caused by not knowing what is wrong with me since I am at the doctor to find out what it is. I may find out that it is something really bad so I am scared of that. I am also afraid that the tests that need to be done will cause me pain or discomfort, and I am especially scared of needles.
0.500000	I think it is just being anxious about your overall health. You do not want anything to be wrong, so you keep thinking about the worst case scenarios while waiting at the doctor's office and you can not get the thoughts out of your head.
0.690500	I worry about judgement of my ability to express my concern adequately. I have encountered many impatient doctors. I often remember questions that I wanted to ask after I leave the appointment.
0.619000	I'm typically at the doctor's office when I'm not feeling well or something is wrong, so I feel anxious or worried about what the diagnosis or problem will be.

0.309500	That they will find something wrong with my health. I am also still a liittle nervous about injections/vaccinations. The older I get, the more anxiety I have about that
0.571400	Usually if I am seeing a doctor it is because something is wrong.  I am a natural worrier and tend to worry that it is the worst case scenario.  Even though I usually know deep down it's not the worst case scenario, I feel tense until the doctor tells me that.
0.761900	I have heard doctors tell me nothing is wrong so many times, and it makes me feel powerless. When I see a new doctor, I am worried that this doctor is going to be like most of the doctors I've had before.
0.500000	I feel most anxious or worried when i visit my doctor's office because i am worried that he might find something else wrong with me. But i trust that he will know how to fix it.
0.142900	Nothing, I've never felt discomfort or anxious when going to the doctor. Worrying about something I can't change is pointless and just adds further stress to my body so I keep myself calm and take the punches as they come.
0.428600	Feeling anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office can be caused by apprehension. The possibility of sick people in the waiting room -- passing along their own illness is always a concern.
0.452400	Sometimes I feel anxious going to doctor because Im scared to know that I have problem in my body. I tried to make my self healthy and avoid bad things that can affect daily living. Doctors sometimes makes me feel sick.

0.214300	Contracting the flu or another airborne pathogen while waiting in the waiting room. Other than that, not much. Most of our visits are well checks where we have no urgent medical treatment needs. So, we spend most of our time making sure our hands are washed and cleaned and use both face masks for protection.
0.404800	I hate social interaction the most. I don't care about the results, because I know that I'm in good shape and doing everything correctly.
0.976200	I feel like the doctor will tell me something bad, something that will effect my life or the way I lead my life. I am fearful of all possible outcomes. I worry about these things that may hurt my family if I am sick.

0.619000	I would feel anxious or worried about a doctors visit if I had a strange pain or feeling in my body that I haven't had before. Not knowing what could be the cause of the pain or illness would make me worried about what the diagnosis could be. I would slightly doubt the doctor fully understands what I am feeling and if the treatment would be the correct procedure for me. I would not feel anxious or worried if I was just going in for a regular checkup or follow up. Only when I am experiencing something I have never experienced is when I would start to worry.
0.571400	I hate small talk with people I don't know that well. Hate answering the same questions over and over, especially ones I don't think are their business or that I know how they are going to respond and I also know I am not going to change my behavior. 
0.452400	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is the thought that something might be wrong with me.  It has nothing to do with my doctor or how he performs checkups or physicals.
0.714300	Sometime I get worried that something will be wrong. I have two beautiful daughters and I always want to be healthy for them. I also have a long family history of breast and ovarian cancer. As well as heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. I always worry that I maybe suseptable to one of these conditions and it worries me.  I ear that one day I will be checked or tested and Iâll end up with a condition that a family member of mine had. 
0.785700	Having insurance issues that make payment difficult is one of my biggest anxiety factors. I also have a hypochondriac streak and expect terrible news about my health.
0.214300	I just don't like not knowing what's wrong.  Sometimes when I go to the dr I jump to the worst possible scenario of what my ailment could be and probably over stress about something that I don't need to stress out about.
0.690500	I have had a recent bad experience of finding out a health conflict I am working through. So now I am on hyper alert and nervous about possible other health issues.

0.714300	Embarrassment mostly. I have GAD and every unknown situation feels me with dread. Pelvic exams are especially uncomfortable.
0.142900	Well now adays I am mainly anxious that the costs of the visit will out weigh the need to go in the first place, I am a woman so I am technically now a pre existing condition.
0.642900	I always have a latent worry spring to life when entering a doctor's office that he or she will find something very wrong with me and the condition will affect my loved ones.

0.595200	Well it's always a scary situation as you get older when you go to the doctor because even if it's something minor they may find something major and the thought is always scary. 
0.190500	I think the most obvious answer is that nobody wants to hear something is wrong with them.  I have an unnatural fear of death anyways.  I do not have a regular physician because I am almost never sick.  So on occasion, when I have been sick or something has been wrong that I felt that I needed to go the doctor, I have worried that I would hear bad news.  The mind tends to go to worse case scenario.  I go to get a yearly mammogram and a yearly pap smear-neither of which is a pleasant experience just for the fact that it leaves me exposed. So that is enough to cause anxiety but add to that the possibility that they will find something wrong is always enough to cause worry.
0.500000	Not knowing what the problem is that you are seeing the doctor for.  SOmetimes small little pains can lead to big problems.  That will definitely cause me to be anxious and worried.
0.500000	The thought of finding out that something is worse than i thought. Especially during the cancer screening. I also worry when i am actually hurt because i know now that they are less likely to prescribe useful medication because of the opium epidemic. A cough that used to get prescribed cough medicine now gets crazy lung numbing pills that are newish to the market. not a fan. I worry about anything they may find, and how i will pay for all of it. 
0.571400	I'm a very introverted person.  I prefer to keep to myself and am usually comfortable talking with anyone outside my immediate family about health issues or mental health issues.  As such, even though I'm fairly familiar with my primary care physician, it still makes me a bit uncomfortable and a bit nervous, or anxious.
0.166700	A dreadful diagnosis such as a terminal disease, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, or organ failure. Anything that makes me worry about dying is worrisome.
0.142900	The most anxious I feel is the wait for the Doctor. I understand that they are busy, but when I sit around waiting long past appointment times I feel like they do not value my time in the same sense that I value theirs by being on time.
0.333300	Nothing really makes me all that anxious. Sometimes I dont like talking about my mental health issues like anxiety or depression because that just sucks. 
0.881000	I get anxious and worried every time I visit the doctor. I'm not quite sure what it is to be exact of the reason that I'm so afraid, but I think that it has a lot to do with me being afraid that something is going to go wrong. When I'm worried, my blood pressure usually shoots up from me worrying a lot. I feel so much dread when going to the doctor. 
0.785700	I never visit the doctor for a good reason, i'e either sick or injured so worrying about the worst case is human nature. Plus the whole thing is uncomfortable, with the doctor feeling up your member, them taking your pee, the waiting room, and paying for it all.  
0.857100	I try to take good care of myself, but I know I don't always make the best choices. And I worry and have anxiety all the time anyways.   So it's just worse when I need to visit a doctor. I always think and worthy about the worst possible scenarios.
0.238100	I feel most anxious when visiting the doctors because I'm fearful of what they may find wrong with my body.
0.857100	I am always anxious that I will receive a diagnosis for a terminal disease such as cancer or heart disease.  It makes me feel very nervous because that is one of my greatest nightmares.
0.261900	I get most worried that I'll be told I have a serious medical condition of some kind, particularly cancer. My family doesn't have a history of cancer or anything, but some of my behavior throughout my life with substance abuse has led to what I think is a higher risk of certain cancers, so that is what makes me most anxious about going to a doctor. But it's not something I dwell on.
0.785700	Not know what they are doing to find or say about what they find. They always say something is wrong so they can push a pill or want you to come back and keep paying them. The health system isnt really designed to cure you because they would lose customers then.
0.571400	i worry they are going to push drugs. I like to do things holistically and the militry drs dont often like that
0.381000	While being pregnant, I always worried about the doctor appts. Is the baby ok? Will the heartbeat sound strong? Are there complications.  I have found that specifically with this circumstance, I was very anxious.
0.785700	I am mostly worried that my care will not be effective or that I don't receive the best care locally. I travel two hours away to a large city for specialized care that is muck better
0.452400	I sometimes feel a little anxious about going to the doctorâs office because my family has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Although I try to eat better and exercise regularly, I sometimes feel that I am going to get bad news from my physician. There are so many factors right now in regards to eating habits, physical fitness, and stress that may easily change your health outcomes. I sometimes associate doctorâs visits with something going wrong in your life. I always expect the worst and think that something bad is going to happen to me and that I need to change something.   
1.000000	"When visiting the doctor's office, my biggest worry is that they will ""find something seriously wrong.""  I don't think that is an uncommon fear, and maybe not even irrational, but it does occur."
0.738100	THINKING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. KNOWING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG AND MY LIFE MIGHT CHANGE JUST LIKE THAT.
0.547600	I am usually worried that something will hurt. I also donât like that Iâm usually in some form of undress. It makes me uncomfortable. 
0.619000	"i get anxious or worried from the very situation of being in a doctor's office or medical setting. This is commonly referred to as ""White coat syndrome"", and I believe I suffer from it as well as a lot of the general population. "
0.738100	First, the paper gown is a nightmare. Who doesn't feel anxious wearing only a bit of paper? My usual appointment is for an annual exam, so there's always anxiety about having potentially cold and uncomfortable metal objects put in my girl bits. And, of course, the fear that the doctor is going to find something horrible/fatal
0.809500	What makes me feel most anxious is just not knowing whether or not I'm alright medically. I don't know if I'll need to increase, decrease, or change my medication.
0.595200	I always worry that there may be something serious with my health.  Recently I have started to have all sort of problems.  There seems to be something with every part of my body.  
0.642900	The potential for being disagnosed with something new and dangerous can make me feel worried.  The potential for being pressured into new medicines and/or shots can make me feel worried.  Being told to take 2 different blood medications when I have not yet started taking the first one makes me feel worried and manipulated.
0.404800	I sometimes worry that there might be something major wrong with me. Like I fear the worst sometimes like if I would to be diagnosed with cancer or something life threatening. 
0.666700	I feel most afraid that the doctor will gloss over what I am saying and not try to understand. I then cannot be reassured by anything said.
0.666700	The fact that I may find out bad news about my health makes me feel worried. For example, my last visit was a pap smear. A few days later, my doctor emailed me saying that they have to do my pap smear over because there were not enough cells to test.
0.428600	I always worry that they will find something that is going to be a problem in my life.  I think I go in hoping for the best and expecting the worse.  But so far so good, nothing wrong with me yet.(knock on wood)
0.238100	Wondering how much the payment will be. Wondering what I might need to solve my issues. Wondering if I could get help for my migraines or would I be stuck with them.
0.571400	I am usually nervous when i need to have any blood work done. It is a terrible feeling, especially if you have to do it on an empty stomach. No matter the assurance that the doctor gives me, i still know that it is going to be an unpleasant experience.
0.881000	I am afraid that something will be discovered that has gone unnoticed, such as cancer! I am nervous at being inspected closely. I am nervous that something is wrong that will be missed or misdiagnosed. I am nervous about my body shape or life choices being judged. I am nervous about the financial cost. I am nervous that some drug will be recommended that I do not want to take or that will be expensive or will have side effects.
0.476200	Just learning something new about my health, especially if it's something negative. But haven't really experienced that so it makes me worry that one day something might come up unexpectedly.
0.285700	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the thought of them finding something that could lead to a terminal diagnosis such as cancer. I do smoke cigarettes (about a pack a day) so sometimes I worry that something would be found to indicate the need for more testing. Uncertainty makes me nervous if it's for something that could potentially be serious. I am generally not anxious or worried when going to the doctor's office though. 
0.309500	I am mostly worried that my weight or blood pressure or something may not be normal and there will be further testing to be done.
0.500000	The thing that makes me the most anxious is that they will diagnose me with something worse than what I expect.  Also, I sometimes worry they will notice something irregular that I didn't notice on my own, such as a tumor or heart conditions like high blood pressure.
0.142900	If I have something wrong with me and I can't pinpoint exactly what it is I get a little bit worried, since it might be something serious.  I always get restless when I'm waiting to hear the information that the doctor will tell me. 
1.000000	Well usually when I go its cause theres something wrong with me thats causing a pretty bad ailment and so I already go into it expecting something bad. I can be a bit of a hypochondriac and that may play on my experience a little bit. But then its also because a lot of the procedures they must do to check you out, are uncomfortable or downright painful. And sometimes, doctors tell you that there is something they found that concerns you and they get you super worried, when they shouldnt say anything until test results come back. Many times I have had them distress me thinking I had an issue such as an enlarged/inflamed liver, just to find out theres absolutely nothing wrong with my liver. The days of stress from worrying waiting for those results is unnecessary. 
0.595200	I just do not like to go the doctor. I worry that the doctor might find something that is wrong or tell me something that I do not want to hear. I worry that my test results might not bge good.
0.523800	"One incident stands out from my 67 years - my current physician said ""we"" needed to check my heart again. Turns out I had a murmur. Subsequent tests revealed a mitral valve problem, which will be corrected via robotic surgery. That was scary for me and still is as the surgery has not been scheduled. Generally, I am somewhat apprehensive concerning new complaints (e.g, a mole). Part of my anxiety is related to having seen family members suffer with various diseases. For example, my father died of cancer at age 40 (I was 11). My mind tends to go to ""cancer"" when I have an otherwise unexplained pain. Generally, however, I find the typical examination to be quite routine and not anxiety inducing (except in the circumstances i have outlined above)."
0.619000	I feel concerned and worried that I might receive bad news when I go to to the doctor. I feel this way even when I have no reason to feel this way.
0.285700	If the doctor found something strange or maligns after the tests.  If I have a chronic condition that affects my entire life. 
0.857100	I worry that the cancer in my eye is active again.  I worry that the doctor is going to tell me that i need my eye out.  I worry that the cancer will spread...even though it was small and i had radiation treatment to hopefully correct it. I worry that my family will fall apart if something re-occurs in my body.  I wonder that the doctor will tell me that I need more treatment and that it's not over
0.142900	i just hope that there is nothing wrong with me and hearing everything is all good that make me feel happy
0.619000	im afraid they will tell me something bad or tell me that im unhealthy because of my weight or vitals
0.666700	I worry about the cost and about having a doctor that might not seem to care about me. If I go see a doctor, I want them to wholly focus on my health when I'm there, and I worry they won't do that.
0.714300	Well, seeing a new doctor is unnerving. Especially if you've ever had a bad experience with a doctor. Also, feeling like your needs may not be met or like there is something unexpectedly wrong with you makes you feel anxious or worried. 
0.285700	sometimes having ot ask for my anti depressant medicine to be refilled gives me a little anxiety because I kinda still feel ashamed and wnoder if they really want to fill it for me.
0.142900	I usually am worried about the cost. Also I worry that my illness or pain might be something worse that will cost more to treat. 
0.619000	That I will get bad news.   That the doctor will tell me something bad about my health.  I also worry that I will have to undergo more tests or treatments.
0.333300	I am nervous about my weight and what they will say to tell me to lose it.  I get anxious that I will be judged.  I hate putting on a thin gown and the office always seems cold.  I hate the paper and waiting an undisclosed amount of time.
0.666700	Worst part is the waiting room, where I come up with worst case scenarios in my mind about all the horrible things that arenât wrong, but they could be. Basically my own mind is why Iâm anxious and worried, nothing more.
0.761900	I feel anxious when I got to the doctor because sometimes im not sure what they will tell me. I get worried because they could tell me im dying and there is nothing that they can do about it and that its too far gone, or they could misdiagnose me and then I could die from getting treatment that I dont even need. 
0.190500	Not knowing why I feel the way I am and is it a really problem or just I need to keep a better check on myself
0.714300	I am worried that they are going to tell me I have some huge problem and then judge me for it. Or that they may just say I do so they can make money. Or make me feel uncomfortable about myself. I am a very private person. The best case scenario is that I go in they say I have a clean bill of health and I just paid them for that. 
0.738100	"I always think there's some random disease they will tell me i have. Im not sure why. I guess its the whole ""not knowing"" thing. "
0.381000	because i am not sure if i will ever get better an i tell the dr iwnt to get better but he says its a long journey
0.357100	I never know what is going to be said so I always have some level of anxiety with doctors visits. I also have had a few bad experiences. 
0.928600	I am anxious that the doctor visit will end up costing a lot of money. Sometimes I think that ignorance is bliss and I would rather not know if something is wrong. If you look hard enough something will always be less than perfect.
0.547600	i'm always anxious about results and i hate having to wait. the wait always makes me worry more and i'm the type of person that usually thinks the worst when something comes up
0.714300	The most worrying experience would be getting bad news or news about a problem that will be hard to fix. Also, getting news that will include discomfort or inconvenience.
0.714300	I always feel anxious about visiting the doctor. I worry about my test results from my last visit. I worry that I will get better news about my health. 
0.666700	I worry that there might be some bad result or that I might be sick and not know it.  I get scared that the test being performed might not have the result I want.  I get nervous days before doctor appointments.  And if I have a procedure done I worry even more because I have to wait for the results.  The waiting is the thing that really makes me worry, if I know I am going to have to wait for some results I lose sleep the week before I have to go in.  Losing sleep makes me even more anxious and by the time I get to the appointment I am really uneasy.  Not knowing the outcome really makes me scared.
0.261900	Most of the time it is the wait to see the doctor.  The sitting to get back into the office then the waiting once I do get into the examining room.  I worry that something new may be needed that will cause an extra charge. So all in all I would say waiting and money.
0.571400	I am worried since I am getting older that something will go wrong. As you age, it's sure that something won't work like it used to.  I want to make sure that I am examined thoroughly and that the doctor spends time doing the appropriate tests.
0.571400	I am a breast cancer survivor so I am always anxious before any doctor appointment now. I feel like I would rather not go and not risk getting anymore surprise bad news. This usually occurs with blood testing or any other types of medical tests. I felt fine before I was diagnosed so I know that there is a chance to feel good and not know something is wrong inside. It will probably make me feel this way for the rest of my life.
0.619000	The thing that makes me the most anxious is when a doctor does not talk much when they dont act like they care.  When a doctor seems like he is having a bad day can make me anxious 
0.333300	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office for something that is not routine (outside of my regular appointments). It is the unknown that I worry about.
0.761900	The biggest fear is that something very bad will be discovered. I worry about going for what seems like a relatively normal ache or pain and finding out I have some deadly or crippling disease. No one wants to hear their upset stomach is stomach cancer. Finances can also be worrisome. I am always nervous I will need to get expensive prescriptions or procedures I did not anticipate.
0.142900	The thing that always gets me going is the blood pressure cuff.  It gets really tight around my arm, and I've always hated that.  But actually seeing the doctor is usually pleasant and problem-free. 
0.571400	I am afraid they will discover something about my health that will be negative, about which I was previously unaware.  Sometimes, I worry they will suggest preventative measures such as immunizations, with which I am not 100% comfortable.  However, in my experience, most doctors I have encountered are quite accommodating to different approaches (mine is more wholistic) to health, as long as they are working/workable.
0.428600	I think I know how things will go, but there's always the possibility that I've missed something. I am never 100% confident in my ability to judge.
0.595200	When I have to have blood drawn or put through other tests to confirm or deny diagnoses. That is very stressful because I have to wait for results and while I am getting my blood drawn most phlebotomist do not know what they are doing
0.142900	There is really nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried. The only thing i do not like is waiting. I am not overly cmnfrotable around sick strangers. I get a little uptight when everyone is coughing and sneezing and the room seems to get smaller. Again I have no worries at the DR other than waiting.
0.714300	When I visit a doctor's office I feel most worried when his or her expression is worried and when he or she can't explain exactly what is going on.
0.476200	They will rush you. Support staff seems disinterested and abrupt. Lack of professionalism in general and seem almost undereducated.
0.404800	I think there is always the thought in the back of my mind that something might be discovered that is a big health problem. I don't stay worried about this constantly, but that thought creeps up most times when I go to the doctor. There is cancer in my family history for example, and sometimes I worry about that. Really, it's just a general thought that pops up during doctor visits.
0.452400	I get worried or embarrassed if it's something super gross that I need the doctor to look at or I have a question about. I worry other doctors might know about it and think I'm weird, even though I know they've seen just about everything from their patients. 
0.357100	I typically feel anxious. I think the only thing that ever worries me is if I think that something is wrong and I am worried about what treatment might be recommended or potential side effects. I am also sometimes worried when I know that I am going to have something painful done
0.285700	It makes me feel worried that he tells me that I have some disease, that gives me a lot of pain if he told me that
0.857100	I really get anxious when I think about my labs coming out bad. The doctor always seems like it is my fault they are coming out bad even though I'm trying my hardest to improve my health.
0.595200	I wonder at what halfassed shit they are going to try and push on to me. The place I go is a little hick clinic. Nice enough people for around here but not well educated enough to suit me.
0.857100	When I go to my doctor's office for a check up, I am always anxious that my blood tests will show that something is wrong. I tested in the pre-diabetic range last time I went, so this is a worry for me right now.
0.476200	Nothing really in particular, I just have doctor anxiety -- along with general anxiety. I think the doctor called it White Coat Anxiety or something like that.
0.523800	I GET ANXIOUS AND WORRIED ABOUT STUPID THINGS. MY JOB, MY FUTURE, MONEY, MY FUTURE RETIREMENT. BILLS
0.619000	Not knowing what the outcome will be and it there has to be something done how bad will it hurt and how long will it take to heal.
0.809500	When it's an issue that potentially requires more than a simple solution to it makes me feel concerned heavily thinking of what may be options or what could be the potential outcome of everything. There are times when I've become overly worrisome as to what could be happening to my health or whether or not these signs are going in line with what I may be thinking is the issue at hand. 
0.571400	"My doctor does my ""well woman"" exams. I don't think that any woman is entirely comfortable with that. My doctor has a good personal manner of dealing with people, though.  I think any time that I put on a gown with no back on it and nothing underneath, I am not going to be at my most confident."
0.595200	Im anxious when I go to the doctor sometimes because I dont know what to expect when I go there. In the back of my head I feel like everything is going to be fine but you never know.
0.619000	"I'm not talking about my primary physician. The NP that I use is awesome. I'm thinking about the orthopedic Doc that I see because of a broken arm. I've seen him for 2 years and I get butterflies in my tummy every time. He is so quick when he talks to me, doesn't listen to me and talks ""over"" me. I always go in worried about what he is going to say. "
0.785700	I'm afraid they're going to point out a medical problem that may be damaging to me. I'm unsure whether or not I can trust them to make the right diagnosis and prescribe what I need. 
0.904800	"I am always worried about how much the visit will end up costing. If my doctor recommends or requires lab tests or imaging, I often can't afford to pay the bill. I have ""good"" health insurance, but in the US ""good"" health insurance still isn't enough for many of us."
0.642900	Typically I feel that way when Iâm having a basic procedure done and routine exam. Not sure why because itâs not the Dr. 
0.476200	I am always worried about getting bad news or bad test results. Doctors offices always just make me feel uneasy. 
0.809500	I fear that they are going to come back and go we just found something terribly wrong with you and... That or its we need to get you on this medication and its going to cost a bazillion dollars and you better take it or there is nothing I can do for you. Or lets run these other tests that I am pretty sure are unreleated but they will boost my bottom line so lets do these. To which I know I will have to seem like a butthead as I ask what specifically they need that test for and why. But of course I dont always trust the answer as again its for making money.
0.976200	I get really anxious about all aspects of visiting a doctor's office. I'm usually very nervous before I even get there. I dread getting weighed. I'm always worried that they will find something seriously wrong with me, even if I'm just there for a minor illness or an annual physical. 
0.571400	Sometimes I get anxious over whether or not something is wrong with me, but mostly I get anxious because I have social anxiety disorder.
0.666700	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is not know what I may have, or what medication I have to take. I am also concerned with the fees I may have to pay.
0.428600	What makes me nervous about being at the doctor's office is being around people who I think are sick.  I'm afraid I will get sick just by being there. 
0.261900	I will have to fight to get the doctor to acknowledge I'm a human being and listen to me. He never has time to actually listen. He hops on the first thing he sees on his phone and writes a prescription. That's worrisome for me. I know I will not get good treatment unless what I have is common and everyone is treated the same.
0.547600	I am often worried about whether I will be treated with respect, more than anything. Or that the doctor I see will dismiss whatever I am struggling with. I also struggle a little with blood draws-- I get incredibly faint. Sometimes I am nervous for my own health, but most of the time if I'm not seeing my primary care doctor, I'm just rolling the dice as to whether I'll get someone rude and disinterested or someone who's an actual professional.
0.142900	What makes me the most worried when visiting the doctors office is finding out if I have a heath related problem that is not good for me. 
0.904800	I'm usually most worried that I will receive some bad news. I've had a lot of health problems in the past and always feel like the worst possible scenario is going to come true.
0.357100	I am comfortable with the exam and tests themselves. What makes me feel anxious is the results of any tests or exams. I guess you could say the unknown. 
0.690500	Overall I do not like doctors, and I have had bad experiences with uncaring doctors before and I do not want to repeat those situations again
0.714300	"The smell of a hospital/doctors office immediately gets me anxious. Moreso however, I almost expect them to say something is wrong (whether or not I have reason to think there is), and either ready injections or prescribe medications. It's primarily the thought of ""what if something is wrong"" and the outcome of it."
0.595200	I feel anxious because of the waiting room and germs (I am a bit of a germophobia and am afraid I might contract an illness while waiting). I also get worried about maybe being pinpointed from the doctor if I didn't follow there instructiosn to the t
0.404800	I always have a little unease that they may find something that is not right. I have always had good health but you never know. 
0.285700	Being in good health and being able to maintain good health. Not wanting to have any issues with my blood work or health. 
0.619000	First of all coming to appointment on time and waiting for up to an hour for the doctor. Then expectation of lack of details after exam.
0.357100	Anxious to see what they are going to say. Because no one or Doctor can know your body better than you. Are Bodies give us signs if something is wrong.
0.809500	I am always afraid now that the Doctor will mess up and diagnose wrong and cost me or my family our lives. 
0.523800	Thinking that he will find something that is wrong that I didn't know about. That there will be something major that will affect my life.
0.190500	More often than not it is just my own imagination conjuring up the worst case scenarios for simple illnesses/problems. There is nothing about the actual visit that makes me anxious. I put it all on myself.
0.881000	I fear that they will find something seriously wrong with me, and they will want to prescribe drugs that have serious side effects.  I also feel that the mind has alot to do with how healthy we are, and once people know that they have a serious illness or disease, they give up, so to speak and go downhill rapidly.
0.142900	What makes me anxious is that my doctor finds something really wrong with me. That would be one of my biggest fears, and to be honest is what makes it harder for me to get a check up from my doctor. Though my doctor does his best to make me feel that I am as comfortable that I can be. No one really wants to hear any type of bad news. Once I hear that everything is fine with my health from my doctor then that is when all of my anxiety disappear. That is what worry about the most.
0.214300	The thing that I'm the most worried about is having to get extra things done like labs where they take blood or running tests because my insurance doesn't cover squat so I have to pay for everything out of pocket.
0.285700	The lobbies and the wait time, It takes way too long and people usually have their kids running around being obnoxious.
0.761900	It is always the waiting process, I feel very dizzy at hospitals because of the classic smell and the test results make me nervous even is they might be very good.
0.857100	Not knowing what the doctor is going to say or what the test results are going to be.  Needles and blood make me nervous
0.666700	I sometimes fear that we will discover something that will have morbid consequences.  It is somewhat irrational when I have no underlying symptoms.  But I cannot help it.
0.238100	I worry a little that they might find something wrong. More than that I worry about having to make choices and advocate to get the treatment I want. 
0.761900	I worry about getting weighed and having my blood pressure taken.  I also worry of course about them finding something bad
0.976200	I usually visit the doctor's when something's wrong, so I am always anxious to find out what it is.  In addition, I fear nasty diagnoses, painful tests, or having to take some horrible drug.  I am very relieved every time I leave a health care building alive and ambulatory, as I feel that just going there presents some level of risk.  For me it's basically a choice between two evils-- the disease or the doctor.  
0.428600	I feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office because I'm fearful that something is wrong that I didn't know about and I'm scared how I will react
0.142900	Actually, I'm not worried when visiting my primary care physician. On occasion, I have been concerned when visiting a specialist regarding what they might find wrong but that is short-lived as I am always determined to approach whatever issue by working with the physician to resolve it.
0.690500	Mostly, I'm worried about whatever situation made me visit the doctor. I don't visit the doctor unless I feel I have a serious problem that won't go away on its own and it will need some medical treatment. This is a very rare occurrance though.
0.642900	Always wonder if maybe he has some bad news after giving his examinations. Also going to a doctor is rare so i'm a bit nervous just interacting with him. If i go to the doctor it is generally because of some problem so i worry about that too.
0.357100	There is always a concern that the doctor will find something wrong with me that is serious.  He could discover something that turns out to be fatal.
0.261900	I always get a little worried something will be wrong. My health is very important to me so I get anxious about it.
0.761900	I think that the things hat makes me the most anxious is just not knowing what to expect.  I often start to imagine the worst situations, like the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me and I let my imagination get the best of me.  I also tend to think that procedures and exams are going to be more uncomfortable than they actually are.
0.619000	I often feel worried that the doctor will give me bad news. I am worried that something some day will be seriously wrong with me and I will have to make a major life change to survive.
0.381000	Health matters are always something to worry about. If we dont have our health then what do we have? My doctor was very open when alerting me to things I really need to worry about and address
0.595200	I guess I just do not want to hear any negative information. Being in a doctors office feels a little cold and sterile. The environment encourages you to feel nervous and a little jittery. 
0.357100	Nothing typically does, I only answered the way I did regarding the few situations where I'm not sure what's wrong/how serious/etc. and I'm worried until the doctor reassures me/gets me the answers I need.
0.428600	I get a little nervous about judgement maybe. Like they'll think Im a hypochondriac if I tell them everything I need help with. I don't like the smell of the place, that alcohol smell. I don't like people touching me. I don't like how you're shoved around like cattle into different rooms. I don't like the front office at doctor's office, they are usually cold and sterile. Just say hello to a patient would be nice. LOL
0.142900	How much the cost is going to be, and what my blood pressure is - although that seems to get me worked up and drive it up more, ha.
0.500000	The times when I don't know what's wrong with me, or how much it's going to cost. Also if I don't know what to do after the doctor leaves the room (do I wait for a nurse? do I go to the checkout desk? do I just leave?)
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting the doctor's office is my fear of social interactions.
0.285700	Not getting the results back quickly is what makes me anxious when going to the doctor or if she can't give me an answer right away and has to rely on lab results instead.
0.857100	they will want to take my blood pressure and start treating me for something completely different from what i came there for. if you look for something you will find something and that is what they always do they think they are not doing their job if they don't give you treatment for something
0.571400	I worry mainly weather or not i have money to pay for the copay and then if my insurance is going to cover the rest. Insurance companies are so weird you never know what they are going to cover and finances are always my biggest stressor. 
0.785700	I get anxious when visited the doctor because I'm afraid of what they might find and that it will be bad news.
0.142900	Nothing makes me anxious.  I am relaxed and calm.  I guess the only thing that makes me a bit anxious is sitting in the exam room wrapped in paper, but I'm fine once someone comes in.
0.452400	I'm worried about the doctor telling me something is wrong with me or I'm anxious about the doctor seeing my penis because I've never had a woman look at it in my entire adult life and I feel like The 40 Year Old Virgin all the time regarding my lack of proficiency with the opposite sex.
0.761900	I lost my mom to a stroke a few years ago so I am now anxious whenever I visit a doctor, I was not prior to suddenly losing my mother. I smoke (less then half a pack of cigarettes a day) and I know the negative impacts this can have on my health so I am always worried. Also my cousin's 18 year old son was just diagnosed with Cancer so I am now aware that anything can happen. 
0.785700	I'm always worried he will find something wrong with me either during exam or with bloodwork. I get anxious getting called in like I've failed the test.
0.309500	I am always worried about  visiting the doctor because you never know what the diagnosis might be it could be good or bad. 
0.309500	The only thing that I could think of is the fear that I may be sick. Other than that I'm not to fearful at the doctors
1.000000	I have a lot of things wrong with me and I am always afraid they will find something new or I will have to have more surgery which is very hard on me and my family
0.857100	I only get to die once an that is all my life can be.  Most people seem bad at accepting this let alone doing something to make it better.  I dislike the mind and the things we've done with them ever more.  Trying to believe someone is professional vested in myself getting an improved life seems beyond any idea of lies I could ever believe with any safety so I approach all medical professionals as near enemies.
0.404800	I sometimes feel anxious or worried because you never know what your blood tests will show even though you may be feeling fine.
0.833300	I might be diagnosed with something horrible. I may need to have further examinations. I may be billed a very high amount.
0.761900	I'm a worrier, always have been, so seeing a doctor, even for a regular checkup, is nerve-wracking to me. I always think beforehand that the doctor will find something wrong or need to do a followup on something that's worrying to him. I tend to get myself worked up before doctor appointments, but that's just my personality.
0.142900	I have met with my new Dr. one time and walked away confident and peaceful that he is my primary Dr. Time will tell.
0.714300	I hope they dont find something wrong with me I wasn't expecting.  I hope they have the answers I need
1.000000	I just have horrible white coat syndrome. We went to the doctor when we were little only if we were terribly ill. I think as a result, I have a profound fear of all medical surroundings. 
0.714300	Not really that I have some condition to where I'm going to die. Sometimes when the doctor is the opposite sex as me it sucks and I hold things back. Some times when it is clear the doctor isn't listening to me I get upset. And most of the time they will judge you and assume things with out knowing for sure. 
0.285700	I hate everything to do with getting any medical thing done.  It makes me feel sick just being there.  The worst by far is getting blood drawn.  I hate it so much and it makes me extremely anxious.
0.738100	I am always worried that something is going to be really wrong and also they it will cost a lot of money. 
0.857100	just not knowing the unknown of the whole situation. worrying about things that you might be wrong with you ect. 
0.571400	Just the act of going there.  The uncertainty of what could possibly happen and what the next steps would be.
0.547600	I get nervous around doctors. I am afraid they might find something really bad about me or it might cost a lot of money. I do not want to have to do any procedures or anything or they might be just judging me by my health, as a person not just a doctor. 
0.738100	I'll answer with another question.  How does one feel when they take their car to the mechanic.  its a similar type of anxiety to me.
0.809500	Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.
0.571400	First, how long am I going to wait. I know doctors have little regard for their patients time as I tend to wait 30 minutes to two hours for them to arrive. If I am  sitting in a doctor's office, I have a health issue, so of course I'm worried that it could be serious.
0.428600	In general, what makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I go for a specific reason. For example, STD testing or I have something I noticed that I want to seek attention for. These are the situations that cause the most anxiety because they aren't specifically routine, but conditional. While I do have an annual physical, I know what to expect based upon historical visits, but when something unexpected occurs it could be anything from minor to severe and you just aren't aware of it. What if that rash is something more? What if that mole isn't right and I need to be referred to a dermatologist? What if that cold wont go away as fast as it should? These are the kinds of situation that cause me anxiety.
0.690500	Finding out I have a condition that cannot be treated or that is crazy expensive. I have issues with my own mortality, so anything that might be cancer always freaks me out.
0.285700	There is actually not much that scares me. I know I have a light heart condition and moderate CAPD. But I know also that I have quality healthcare and that this healthcare is available when I need it. I have regular check-ups and have cardiac training 3 times per week.
0.833300	The reason that I'm there is usually not a good reason. That in itself causes me to have anxiety, especially if I am not feeling well, or have a problem. Also, medical procedures make me uncomfortable. Examinations usually also get personal or require talking about matters that make me uncomfortable by their nature. I'm also concerned that they are going to find something terrible, or that I'm going to have to do something that requires a lot of suffering to improve the situation.
0.690500	WHEN THE DOCTOR DO THE PHYSICAL CHECK AND KEEP TESTING OR DOING THE SAME TEST AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT GET ME WORRY THAT THERE IS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY HEALTH. 
0.547600	I am anxious at the doctors office because i am sick and do not know what is going on with my body. I worry the treatment is going to be painful or uncomfortable and this brings my anxiety up. 
0.285700	Finding out that my I might have inherited a health problem from a family member during a check up or analysis, that is always a major concern and cause for nervousness when booking a check up.
0.857100	I just am an anxious person.  I don't like the doctor's office and try to avoid it when possible.  I go when needed though and usually good comes of it.  I just get so nervous that something might be wrong or that they're judging me.
0.333300	There's not really alot that would make me worried about actually seeing the doctor. If anything I would be the most worried about why I am going to the doctor. If I dont know what is going on and it is something that has been bothering me, it more about the unknown. The other thing I would be nervous about is if I have to go to the doctor last minute and I have to see another doctor that I havent seen before. When you see your regular doctor there is already some trust there so seeing someone else doesnt feel right to me and it is hard to trust them because they are not my doctor. Lastly, when I go for my yearly exam it just makes me nervous because of the discomfort. 
0.285700	The number one thing would be the discovery of something that is asymptomatic. I'm sixty years of age and feel pretty good. So I guess any anxiety I might feel would be tied into discovering an issue that I had not planned on.
0.452400	I hate the unknown, this is what causes so much anxiety when I go to the doctor.  My doctor actually tries to help the anxious feelings since she knows how I feel when I go.  I don't like surprises so my anxiety comes from not knowing what is going on or what will be done about it.  I wish I didn't feel this way so I wouldn't be so uncomfortable about going.
0.595200	For one thing, if there is the flu going around like now, I am very hesitant and anxious to go get bloodwork or general exam because I don't want to end up catching the flu from the sick people there. Beyond that, I just have had a few years recently that I feel going to the doctor is a waste of money for me, I leave with no answers, no solutions and just more broke. I have no confidence in the doctors at this juncture to at least point me in the right direction regarding my health. It is a frustration that I'm currently dealing with as a matter of fact. I personally feel (and many others in similar situations that I have talked with) feel that Novant Health, in particular, has ruined my family practice that I've gone to for decades. In recent years, it's just become a waste of money as I'm shuffled in and out after paying. That in and of itself, the lack of confidence I have now in the process, does cause me anxiety, as well as teh finances.
0.261900	I'm always a tiny bit worried when I'm at the doctor just because I worry they could find something wrong that I didn't expect but for the most part, this is not something I'm too worried about and I trust that most of my doctor appointments will go generally well as expected.
0.285700	The wait time makes me anxious. And having multiple ppl to interact with that could possibly be sick. 
0.690500	Are they going to be honest? Is this doctor actually a doctor for the right reasons? Who can be trusted? Why can't we find a middle ground as far as chemical drug treatments and nontraditional healing?
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when I visit a doctor's office.  I am calm and looking ahead at what I will learn about the doctor and my health.
0.523800	I am always afraid that they will want to draw blood from me.  I have a very severe phobia of needles and I almost always pass out.  It's embarrassing and I always have to explain myself before they start the process.  I usually tell them it's probably safer for everyone if they let me lay down somewhere while they are taking the blood.  I have hit the floor several times and hurt myself after passing out.  It's a terrible thing to live with.  
0.381000	I feel anxious when I have a sudden medical issue that presents itself that needs to be seen by the doctor. Also, when I'm having an unusual test done, like a biopsy, I feel very anxious.
0.404800	I am a hypochondriac and believe that even the most minor symptom is due to something larger and i'm dying. When I visit the doctor, i feel he will confirm that i'm really sick,
0.666700	Social interactions in general are a big thing for me. I am not very good at handling them without some form of anxiety cropping up. I also feel that going into the office is like going into the unkown where I might find anything to be wrong with me that could change my life.
0.142900	I am afraid they might find something that is out of the ordinary. The daunting feeling of fear is what is the most worrying. 
0.809500	I am worried something wrong with me will be discovered. I would prefer to be healthy and not have to worry about dying/suffering so there is always that fear in the back of my mind.
1.000000	"Can I just repeat the word ""everything"" ten times? My health keeps getting more and more... interesting as time passes. Nobody knows why I can't walk more than a few feet. Nobody knows why I'm nauseated all the time. Or why I trip over my own shadow on a regular basis. After a while, you get really tired of doctors saying to you, ""Wow, that's really weird."""
0.857100	i often feel as though i cannot accurately describe my issues because i feel nervous or afraid, and when i do try, i often feel misunderstood or dismissed. i also worry about things i can not control, such as exposure to other sick people or uncertainty about the physicians own care and sterilization practices. 
0.785700	The things that make me feel most anxious at the doctor's office are a) my ability to communicate clearly the symptoms I am experiencing and how often I experience them and b) describing intimate or personal issues with female nurses and doctors.  I am far more comfortable with male doctors or nurses.
0.857100	Sometimes I'm worried that something might come up. Like I might have an illness that I didn't know about. The waiting is really intense sometimes. 
0.619000	I am always nervous that something will be wrong with me. I get nervous sitting in the waiting room because I imagine whatever symptoms I am experiencing could be a serious illness. I worry about the doctor not saying much because they get concerned while examining me.
0.547600	Test results. I have a few issues with my blood sugar and A1C, so I'm always a little anxious about what they will say about my sugars and my weight. I do not want to have insulin at any point in my life, so I've been working on controlling sugars without it. Sometimes I succeed, but not always. And a lot of doctors don't approve of the diet I'm using(ketogenic), unless they have a higher understanding of nutrition.
0.785700	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is not being taking seriously. It seems most doctors are so quick to send you on their way so that they can get to their next patient. It is so hard to find a doctor who acts they actually care now - a - days. Im also worried about being treated for the wrong thing while the real problem is growing stronger. I had a friend who had a tumor the size of a basket ball on her uterus. The doctor told her she was pregnant. So for two months she walked around thinking she was pregnant. Turns out she had a very progressed cancer tumor on her uterus. She almost died from being mis- diagnosed.
0.928600	Even though I trust my primary care physician, I still worry about my health. I worry the doctor might tell me some bad news about my health. I worry a pain I have might be cancer or something else serious. I worry about pain and death.
0.261900	I am most anxious that i will get bad new at the doctor such as high blood pressure or something else going wrong. I usually do not have any issues once i am there but the lead up to going to the doctor makes me very anxious and worried. 
0.857100	I get extremely nervous and upset with every doctors visit that I have. Iâm always worried that something worse is gonna be found out or even just something new that could potentially be bad. I hate all the tests and blood work and just initially everything about it. I canât wait to get it over and done with and get back out of the office. Iâve always been this way and I suppose itâll never change. Even if it is just a simple checkup or something like that my heart still races and I get very anxious and nervous.
0.666700	Mainly that something will be wrong, when I go for the next check up, I'm getting older and I smoke and this is around the age when my mother started to have medical problems.
1.000000	I have never been a health-minded individual and have been obese most of my life. I become defensive when I feel judged regarding my health. I am deeply worried about my health but much more afraid of finding out that something is seriously wrong.
0.619000	It's a personal anxiety that is provoked when an extended period of time has passed between sessions, and I have to say that it doesn't help when they start asking directly related questions back to back.
0.642900	I always feel like my doctor doesn't want to be there and would rather be doing anything else, besides working.  I always feel like I am a burden and not someone who should be there because I deserve to be there.  I find my doctor is always on me about something.  I always feel like when I am asked a question, regardless of my answer, the doctor will interject something else I should do instead of any positive feedback.
0.404800	It is an irrational emotion that sometimes comes up, but not always.  I like to have the experience behind me each year.  As I have aged, this has been the case, for when I was young, I seldom saw a physician, except once for a gall bladder attack due to which, the gall bladder was removed. That period was somewhat anxious until over.  But that was 25 years ago. 
0.738100	Feeling anxious or worried about doctor's visits stems from the uncertainty of the entire experience. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong or even if your doctor will diagnose correctly.
0.857100	That I won't be listened to, or my illness will be dismissed with a bottle of pills and no alternative or other viewpoints.
0.309500	What makes me most anxious is not knowing a diagnosis. I am a planner, so when the outcome is not predictable, it makes me stressed out and worried. I am anxious until I find out what is wrong and how it can be fixed.
0.452400	What would make me feel anxious or worried is the unknown. Primarily aside from yearly check ups the reason for going to the doctor would because there is somethingwrong with my body. So the not know what is going on would make feel uneasy.
1.000000	Not knowing what is wrong with me or having the doctor or nurses find out additional problems that I had no idea about.
0.666700	I feel my doctor my find something horribly wrong with me during an examination or he might give me bad news. General anxiety at being examined, poked, and prodded, its a very intimate interaction that doesn't happen often.
0.166700	I am just a worrier in general its my personality. At the doctor's office all that worries me is getting sick from touching something as I feel there are a lot of germs in these places.
0.381000	The fear of hearing some kind of bad news. Even if it's just a routine check-up, I'm always fearing the worst in terms of hearing bad news. The entire atmosphere at a doctor's office gives me that vibe. 
0.738100	As a female I'm used to the fact that a lot of doctors will tell women that whatever is wrong with them is because of hormones or stress, and so I worry that they're going to miss something important. Particularly since doctors are far more interested in a woman's privates than her heart (annual heart scans aren't in vogue, but they'll nag for a pap) when heart attacks are one of the top killers of women. The problem is, you never know if you got a good doctor or not until you've seen him/her, so I'm always anxious thinking I might be going through the embarrassment and cost of seeing this person that I might never want to go back to for my care. Then you have to start all over again with a different doctor, with the same worries. 
0.666700	I think I get anxious just because it is usually for an acute problem, so it was not something I had scheduled. It ends up making me rebalance my board study schedule which makes me anxious. 
0.142900	I really don't have those feelings.  I guess when a new issue comes up  there might be a thought that it could be something bad and incurable but I don't dwell on things like that.
0.642900	I feel worried because I think about the possibility that I have an untreatable disease or a long term disease that will affect my life
0.714300	I am confident that I do not currently have major health issues, but I do struggle with extreme pain from a root cause that is not serious (life threatening). I get anxious when going to the doctor because my pain issues get dismissed due to my relative good health otherwise. I worry that my problem will never get solved and that going to the doctor is a waste of my time and money. 
0.428600	The one thing that causes me to be anxious or worried is that I sometimes put off going to the doctor over aches and pains and I am afraid he will find something majorly wrong with me. 
0.166700	I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I like that I have a woman doctor because I feel I can talk to her about anything, included issues only women have. I feel comfortable if I need to be physically examined because she and I are women. I feel she better understands women's issues because she probably had/ has them two.
0.238100	If im super sick or think something may be wrong then seeing the doctor and getting that either confirmed or not is stressful
0.857100	firstly i don't like being poked and looked over. secondly the fear of having a serious disease is always in the back of my mind when visiting the doctor. lastly it's also just the fear of not having control of the situation. 
0.857100	I am always concerned about finding out information that yields a high likelihood of having a terminal type illness or chronic condition.  I guess I openly feel like I have a chronic condition which cannot be helped without surgery and/or medication.  Both of these alternatives really cause worry for me.  I do not like medication at all.  I feel that the side effects associated with them increase the problems associated with my health. Furthermore, I know any surgery can turn more problematic so I would say it is the uncertainty that makes me most anxious.
0.714300	Usually when I'm anxious for a Dr. visit it's when I'm feeling real bad and expecting the worst. In those cases it's always been less severe than I imagined which is a good thing.
0.833300	That they won't believe me. Or the that the next step in my treatment will be scheduled too far out and I have to wait a month to have a test done.
0.285700	I do not feel anxious or worried at my doctor office. I feel like my doctors office has everything under control and makes everything as calming and relaxing as possible.
0.190500	The doctors office has always been a place that is scary to me. It is just the thought of the unknown, because we have all heard stories about the people who just go in for a normal check up and find something terribly wrong or something of that nature, and plus I had to get a series of painful shots when I was younger, so my perception of the doctor's office and hospitals has never been very good, although it has gotten better. It is more the place itself, and the unknown factor that worries me than anything that my doctor or any other physician does.
0.142900	I wouldn't call what I feel when I visit a doctor's office either anxious or worried.  It's more like frustrated and indignant.  Especially when I'm on time and they are not.  I don't spend much time anxious or worried in general - why should a doctor's office be any different?  It is what it is - worry never helps.
0.642900	"I have general anxiety disorder - my default brain state is slightly worried, with a tendency to latch onto any ""abnormal"" event as a cause for worry/stress/bad reaction. Specifically with doctor's visits I worry that they will ""find something"" wrong. There is really no reason behind it, and I am fully aware of this. I can deal with it, but I still have to experience it. I actually relax/do better if they do find something, because then I can talk about it, get, and give more info. It is mostly the unknown that is bothersome to my brain."
0.428600	Are they going to be on time or are they going to keep me waiting around for an extended period of time?
0.690500	I am most anxious and worried when going to the doctors office because I am anxious that something will be wrong. There are several conditions that run in my family, like diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure and more.  Each time I go to the doctor, even for a routine physical, I am always anxious that this will be the time we find out that I have those conditions too.  I do not like taking prescriptions and therefore do not want to have to start taking them for life. 
0.785700	I'm usually worried that I'll find out something negative about my health, due to the poor choices I've made in terms of diet and exercise. 
0.285700	I don't have any anxiety when I go to the doctors office.  I usually only make appointments when necessary so I don't feel that anyone's time is wasted.  the only thing that really bugs me is when I have to wait a long time without any feedback from the front office staff.  I know that emergencies come up which throws the schedules off, but I believe that keeping patients informed is important.  If you don't let them know about a schedule change you are basically saying that their time isn't as valuable as someone else's.  so I guess this is my anxiety issue when going to the doctor. 
0.619000	If I am getting a pap smear, I have been hurt in the past because of carelessness. So, I almost always tense up when I am getting that done due to past trauma.
0.404800	What usually makes me nervous about going to the doctor's office is when there's something that i feel is wrong with me that's beyond a regular checkup. It doesn't really have anything to do with the doctor since it's mostly the situation that got me in to the office to begin with. But when there is something worse than usual, then everything from the wait in the waiting room and the patient room to just talking to the doctor/nurse is nervewracking
0.142900	I don't. This doesn't apply to me. I don't go in feeling nervous or anxious when going to the my doctors.
0.714300	I am always a bit uneasy going to the doctor.  I worry that he is going to find something wrong with me.  I'd almost rather not know.
0.476200	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I have symptoms, or am suffering from an illness and have no idea what it is.  If my symptoms are extreme, sometimes I'm anxious or worried.
0.285700	The only thing that would make me anxious or worried is the condition that sent me to see the doctor in the first place.  I'm the sort of person who won't go to see a doctor unless I think there is something seriously wrong.  Not serious in the sense that I might think something life threatening but serious in the sense that it's something my body's defense system seems to be incapable of taking care of on it's own.
0.761900	I think I am just allergic to doctor's offices!  I am one of those people whose  blood pressure goes up when tested in the doc's office.  I look at the trays of sharp instruments lying in wait on the counters and I am uneasy!  I have a vivid imagination.  I am anxious about any invasive tests, about possible pain, about possible bad news, esp. as I get older and older.  I have learned to trust my doctor, and as I have reached the age just this year when my yearly physical exam does not have to include a gyn exam, I am much more relaxed.  
0.809500	The thought of what could be found or diagnosed. I have not had much health scares up to this point but I am aware I am getting older and things are bound to happen. Both of my parents are both still living and very healthy for the most part.
0.142900	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I have always been pretty relaxed while I was there.
0.547600	"Nobody likes to be ""exposed"" to someone they barely know.  This in itself is enough to create an awkward and uncomfortable environment.  Most times I really don't want to know how much I weigh and that always makes me feel crazy too."
0.761900	I'm worried that my doctor won't take time to hear my concerns. Also, I am anxious about possible test results.
0.285700	I do not  feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am confident that things will go well and that evverything will be fine and dandy after I leave the office.
0.381000	I get most anxious and worried about the bill I will receive. I have an HMO and pay $25 for PCP office visits. However, after my appointment my doctor's office will re-evaluate the co-pay and what was discussed and bill me for items that came up in conversation during an appointment. 
0.738100	I usually feel anxious that they're going to find something wrong with me than is worse than what I though.  If I have a cough, I worry it might be related to the lungs or that they may not be able to get my symptoms under control.  I worry that I'm going to be judged and this all makes me anxious and worried. 
0.333300	Occasionally, I feel anxious at the doctor's office. I feel like I am in a vulnerable position and I do not know if something will be wrong with me that I did not know about before.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I am attending these types of appointments because I am a laid back and relaxed person. I taking everything one step at a time and see no reason to stress over anything.
0.452400	There is always the risk that something could be found that was not foreseen, but on the whole this is not how I typically feel since I lead a relatively healthy lifestyle.
0.261900	I just feel anxious because I'm afraid something might be wrong with me. I am afraid I will be told something I don't want to hear. But I do trust my doctor.
0.285700	Since I do not feel these emotions when visiting my primary care physician, I will describe those feelings of going to my previous dentist.  I used to have these feelings when visiting my dentist because I wasn't taking good care of my teeth. I think I don't have these feelings now is because I have taken an active role in my total healthcare.
0.285700	I don't usually feel anxious or worried. If I do it's usually when I have a rare or odd issue that I am not sure will be diagnosed.
0.285700	I don't get anxious to actually see my doctor, the only thing that may make me a little anxious is when I go to the doctor for a specific pain or something and then I worry that something may be wrong with me and I don't want to get bad news 
0.500000	I feel most worried is when the doctor finds an issue and he does not know how to treat it in the first steps. It is unknown and could be life threatening.
0.142900	The possibility of having some kind of surgery. I have always had a fear of having surgery and the operating table in general since I was little. 
0.714300	I feel most anxious if a doctor is not open to my full explanation of what my body is doing. Most doctors are too close minded regarding nutritional therapy and so I tend to be skeptical of a doctors quick diagnosis. I know my body the best so I trust my insight more than them.
0.357100	I worry that I'll get admonished for not taking care of myself (my weight has been creeping up lately) or that my blood pressure will suddenly be high or something else unexpected.
0.142900	If I have something new that's wrong with me and I'm already concerned, then yes, I am nervous going to the doctor, but it doesn't have anything to do with my physician. It just means I know that something is wrong and I'm nervous to find out what it is.
0.571400	I am mostly afraid of them telling me something new is wrong that I did not know before and that I will have to start taking some new kind of medications.I can hardly afford what  I am on now even with all of my healthcare. I can only imagine what it would be like if they had to put me on more.
0.809500	I have been for several different exams and what bother me the most is, I usually know what the problem is and so does he but I dont really wanna hear what it is. The few rare times when I dont know what it is, Im worried about cost, and what I will have to do for treatment or if something new is wrong that I will have to deal with. You always have the dread of finding something new, when you think you know what is wrong, doesnt happen very often but when it does, it scares you.
0.285700	I rarely feel terribly anxious unless I am experiencing a very painful or unusual condition. If that is the case, I am most anxious about receiving a bad diagnosis.
0.142900	Having to sit on the exam table.  I'm a big guy and it is tough to get on that thing and sit.  I would rather sit in the chair.
0.333300	The main thing I don't like going through is a breast exam and/or a pelvic exam. I would imagine both of those are slightly uncomfortable for almost all women. I know they have to be done though, so I manage to get through them whenever they are needed.
0.523800	I'm anxious that there might be something really wrong with me like having life-threatening illness. I don't want to have something that will make me change my way of life. 
0.904800	Authority figures in general make me feel uneasy, but i hate going to the doctor. i am not sure why, I also hate getting naked in front of anyone who is not my fiance. That is a huge trigger for my anxiety. I don't like being poked and proded or touched.
0.333300	I just don't enjoy people poking and prodding me. Even worse is that you're paying to be poked and prodded. They usually don't seem very confident in what they are doing or why they are doing it, It feels very impersonal almost like you're a car at a mechanics shop and not a living breathing human with thoughts and emotions.
0.738100	I don't like to give details about private issues. The healthcare system seems to be set up as a referral business. The first visit is just to get a patient to go somewhere else.
0.428600	I'm anxious that my doctor might say something is off with my blood levels and or the nutrients I am recieving.
0.381000	It really depends on what I am going for.  Most recently I had to go because I was having knee pain related to an old injury.  When you go to a new dr and say you need strong pain killers some times they think you are just trying to get drugs
0.238100	It depends on my reasoning for visiting the doctors office. If its a matter of me being really sick or something that could of been wrong at a pregnancy checkup I was very worried. I had went in a couple times only to find out I had lost the baby my future pregnancy checkups were always a huge scare and worry but as far as routine checkup it wasn't ever a problem.
0.500000	Being touched makes me highly uncomfortable and I would rather you not do that, please and thank you.
0.476200	I don't like when she rushes me.  I don't like when she does not listen to my health concerns.  It makes me anxious that something could go wrong that my doctor could simply brush off and overlook.  I often wonder about a mole on my back, which she said was benign just by looking at it.  Meanwhile she is not a dermatologist.  And she then referred me to a dr that had killed my friends father by misdiagnosing him.
0.285700	I am most worried about the cost. I have the very good luck to never have health insurance when I need it, and even when I do it's still a large expense. I rarely feel any kind of anxiety over my health when I'm able to see a doctor, it's when I can't that worries me.
0.428600	I think what makes me feel the most anxious is what they might find. I worry a lot about my health and always fear the unknown. 
0.190500	That my health isn't what I want it to be and that it's going to be terminal or worse. That's it really
0.809500	Noodle's I don't like the pain being told something is wrong in my body really make me worried are just having to visit my doctor 
0.571400	When my doctor writes something down and doesn't mention anything about it to me. My doctor knows more about me than I do and I know nothing.
0.142900	Nothing really, maybe if they leave the examination room ans don't return for a while, I may get a little tense, thinking that something on my account is delaying their return.
0.476200	Unexpected health issues, or issues that seem minor and turn out to be much larger. I am fearful for my health as I get older so having a good examination is really important to me.
0.285700	I usually get good reports for the most part. Unknown is always worrisome. Something can happen that is unexpected and you can take things for granted. Health is always one of those things. My doctor does a good job of not keeping me in the dark about anything but you always worry about the what if. Mortality is a scary concept. Worry about what happens to my family is something goes wrong. Worry about how to pay large medical bills even though I have good insurance. No matter how prepared you think you are I don't think anything can prepare you for a very bad medical report.
0.761900	The great unknown. If I'm in the doctor's office it's because I really need to be there, and I'm usually heading out of the country or returning and something has gone wrong.
0.619000	Knowing that a doctor could give me information at any time that could change my life forever makes me a little nervous.  Or when connected to an EKG machine and they tell you not to worry--how can you not be a little nervous.  Or, waiting for a test result that seems to take forever.
0.571400	Whether I wasted my time and money or if this will be one of the few times Iâm actually provided a medical solution to whatever Iâm there for. 
0.333300	Not being able to know the outcome it what makes me the most anxious worried.  The actual act of being at a doctor's office and talking with a doctor doesn't make anxious or worried, usually.
0.309500	"Since I have diabetes, I am aware of its symptoms and comorbid conditions/disorders. The main thing I worry about when visiting the doctor's office is being ""found out"" if I didn't follow doctor's orders from the last visit or I slipped a little. I want to present as the perfect patient, though I know there's not one. I don't like being told I'm doing something wrong since I do try so hard to maintain any and all progress. "
0.571400	I don't feel anything in particular.  Why should I?  I don't know whether or not to trust what they say. So why should I feel anything?
0.976200	It was just one situation while i was prgenant and i just didn't want to go because i knew i would get myself upset at what they had to tell me.
0.619000	Whether or not that i would bleed once I was in the office. The doctor always needs to draw a significant amount of blood, usually until I get dizzy. 
0.785700	Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel.[1] The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch
0.833300	You never truly know what a doctor could tell you. Your body and mind can feel 100% sometimes and the inside of you could be completely destroyed. 
0.976200	The outcome of a diagnosis would be what I fear most. I do not participate in many actual exams, I don not like people touching me. Not even for a shot or checking heart rates. I just get extremely anxious about seeing any DR for fear of bad news.
0.476200	I am mostly anxious or worried because I have little faith in their ability to diagnose my problem. Or show concern by getting to the underlying cause of my problem. Medical costs keep going up and up and yet is seems as if medical care has been drastically declining.
0.452400	Hardly ever but sometimes i will think the doctor is going to tell me that there is something more that is wrong with me.
0.476200	it would be only when my doctor is not there and i would have to deal with another doctor that i don't really trust or know to much 
0.690500	I feel more anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I never know what they may find. It is an uneasy feeling going in and having to wait and see what may possibly be wrong with you. It makes me overall nervous and my blood pressure rises a bit when I go to the doctor's because of fear of the unknown. What also makes me most anxious is the kind of tests they may have to do or if I have to get a shot, or blood drawn.
0.666700	Just afraid that they will find something that is not good. I haven't really taken care of my body from like 12 to 22 using heroin and doing whatever drugs I could get my hands on. Just the past three years I got my life otgether and my health is phenomonal. But I am worried I will have something go wrong with my brain because I have had two traumatic brain injuries. I don't want the doctor to tell me I have brain cancer
0.571400	What makes me feel worried is that they will quickly prescribe meds and will give you no inside depth to how you can truly take care of yourself by keeping your body in an alkaline state to fight off diseases and ailments.
0.642900	I am never sure if my condition will get worse.  I don't want to have a negative report but understand it is a possibility.    I have to live in reality when it comes to the information. 
0.357100	I had a major illness when I was younger, and it took the doctors a long time to find out what was wrong.  I had to have blood drawn on a daily basis for over a month.  To this day I still hate having blood drawn.  I always look away, and just hate when I have people who aren't that competent drawing blood.  I also worry about what hereditary conditions I may have.
0.261900	It's probably a dumb reason, but her hands are very cold. She's a tiny woman and being in a doctor's office all day doesn't help her warm up. She apologizes, but that makes me a little anxious. If I had recently been ill, I also feel a little anxious about my lab results. I don't get many colds or the flu, but when I do I feel very sick. That makes me think there might be some other problem, but so far it's not been very serious. 
0.690500	Due to the fact Iâve already had 9 surgeries on my shoulder Iâm always worried I might need more. Iâm only 25 and Iâve had 3 shoulder transplants so it always makes anxious when I go.
0.809500	I'm getting older. I always feel my body deteriorating and I'm just always scared something new is going to pop up. I'm not a hypochondriac, yet I do worry about my health because it really isn't very good. 
0.571400	I wonder if they will find some kind of health condition I was not aware I had. I also wonder if they will judge or criticize me for things like not getting enough exercise or always eat nutritiously.  
0.761900	I am most worried about examinations which may be physically painful or uncomfortable, as this has necessarily been a common occurrence for me lately. I am also a reserved person, and therefore may feel physically or even emotionally vulnerable in these moments. This is particularly true if my condition is a source of embarrassment to me, such as a urinary tract infection. I may also be anxious about forgetting to ask a clarifying question in the moment, or otherwise missing the opportunity to inform myself or give the doctor helpful information which can lead to more effective treatment.
0.571400	Nothing makes me feel anxious more than just having to wait in the waiting room. It seem unnecessary to have an appointment at a certain time then be force to wait another 30 minutes or so. Can be very frustrating when they do this at the office. I get anxious because I could have been doing better things with my time then spending it at a waiting room. This waiting time feeds into my anxiety, but most of the time I feel like I am in the clear, and have no issues I should be worried about since I get tested every three months.
0.142900	The only thing I get worried about is that I am going to forget to tell the Dr. something or not be able to communicate correctly.
0.571400	Probably just fear of the unknown.  While I'm healthy in general, you never know what might happen or what tests may show to the doctor that you are not even aware about.
0.309500	you never know if they might find cancer. You could go to the doctor for something you think is probably minor, but it is actually something really bad
0.190500	I'm worried that they might find something wrong with me. It also makes me anxious being poked and prodded. It is a little uncomfortable. It's quite personal and not at all private.
0.738100	It is always the test results. They give me so much anxiety, it makes me nervous and I even start shaking sometimes.
0.571400	Sometimes I feel like I'm not where I should be weight wise. I am a shy and modest person for the most part and having a physical exam makes me nervous.  I also am worried he will find something that I had no idea was an issue with my health.
0.452400	What makes me anxious about visiting a dr. appointment is the wait. I see and hear sick people and worry Im going to get what they have. I also feel uncomfortable being in a confined space with people that I know are sick
0.285700	I always worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. Its not the doctor herself that makes me worry, just the thought that one day she might tell me I have cancer or something.
0.285700	My blood pressure. I always worry that it's going to start spiking. It doesn't though, so I am mostly worrying about nothing.
0.476200	Doctor's offices and hospitals in general are never fun places to be, it's where people go when they are sick or hurt or dying.  Really not a whole lot of positive connotations there. Also, there's always an irrational fear the doctor is going to stick you with needles or tell you you have cancer or whatever.
0.190500	I think it is the diagnosis itself. My mind goes to a bad place for a bit thinking of the what ifs and the problems I have been having. My grandfather died of cancer 2 years ago because his doctor wasn't thorough and didn't catch the cancer at all. My mind always goes to that instance and I wish it didn't. I don't feel a ton of anxiety but it's enough to make me think back to what happened to my grandfather. I don't want that to be me.
0.666700	When I visit my doctors office what makes me feel the most worried is that I will be told that I have a chronic illness. I worry because both of my parents suffer from illnesses and I know that they are hereditary. My mother suffers from high blood pressure and my dad from diabetes. I want to avoid both of the illnesses for as long as possible, but since I am overweight I have a higher chance of developing any of these illnesses. Therefor on my annual checkups when I go for my results I do get nervous and anxious because I don't want to be given bad news. 
0.666700	"I tend to be an anxious person in general and have a family history of high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This often manifests in ""white coat syndrome"" when my physician or a nurse takes my blood pressure. It is usually off the charts the very first test, and sometimes it stays that way throughout the examination. This issue is further compounded as my employer/insurer has a ""wellness program"" that ties the outcomes of routine examinations with insurance premiums for the year, so there is extra incentive to maintain healthy numbers (with blood pressure being one of those numbers). For that reason, I record weekly blood pressure measurements to bring with me to examinations; unfortunately, my normalized recordings are not the ones that make it ""into the record"" for the wellness visit numbers..."
0.190500	Any medical appointment makes me a little anxious simply because I will have to bare myself and be uncomfortable. The only time I get worried is if I suspect that there may really be something wrong that may not turn out well.
0.690500	That they are judging me. I just get so anxious that most of the time I won't tell them certain things because I'm embarrassed.
0.285700	Sitting surrounded by sick people, in an environment where nosocomial infections abound. A doctor's office is where sick people come, and a percentage of them are contagious.  Limiting the amount of time in a doctor's office reduces exposure risk.
0.142900	I sometimes get nervous that I will get sick while I am there. If I am going to puke I would prefer to do it in the comfort of my own home.
0.571400	I worry that there might be something wrong with me and that I would need to get more tests done or even surgery and I worry what me family will do if I am not able to help as much as I have a son to support. 
0.142900	I am usually pretty comfortable visiting the doctor, the only thing that makes me really nervous is having to be completely naked or getting a gynecology exam.
0.285700	I am afraid that I might be diagnosed with cancer since I smoke.  My mother had lung cancer.  She died two years ago.
0.357100	I am sometimes anxious because they may find out something that is wrong with me that I am unaware of. Going to the doctor is just is a stressful thing.
0.333300	That I may have some dread disease that cannot be cured or will take a log of treatments to cure.  That the chronic condition that I have has gotten worse or something is prescribed that I cannot accomplish
0.333300	It feels kind of impersonal and condescending to be sitting there feeling as though you are being talked down to most of the time, or like you have 15 minutes of this doctor's time and then he's moving on. Being on display makes me feel anxious.
0.333300	I feel a little worried about the possibility of the doctor finding a chronic disease that is not curable or treatable.  I also feel anxious that I may not be in as good health as the last physical exam.
0.666700	Vaccines and tests that are not needed being given. Getting sick from the people around me in the office. 
0.142900	I usually just worry that things are going to be worse than they actually are. Usually, it turns out to be the opposite, but still. The not know or that feeling that something might actually be really bad is what worries me the most. Sometimes things get in my head that I can't seem to shake off.
0.261900	It is the waiting time when you get to the office. Getting right in would make me feel less anxious there since I am getting in and learning of any issues as soon as I get there. 
0.857100	It mostly isn't  a conscious thing, I just get this feeling of dread from being in hospitals even if I am not the one being treated, I don't really know why. but weighing myself causes anxiety because i am really fat and I know that the doctor is going to bring it up (which is their job so I am not saying it is wrong). I also have anxiety about my health so I am always nervous that they are going to find something wrong with me. Also if I am being honest there is an inferiority complex going on, doctors are successful and even though I know it's just in my head there is a feeling like the doctor is looking at me like I am a looser.
0.619000	When visiting the doctor, I am always aware of the possibility that something I considered a minor issue may seem more serious to my doctor and lead to a diagnosis of an urgent health issue. 
0.285700	The concern on something being actually wrong with me. Being sick is the concern that makes me not want to go to the doctor and self access myself via web md.
0.619000	I typically won't go to a doctor's office unless I am completely sure something is wrong. By the time I am there, I know I have a problem and I tend to worry about how bad it is at that stage. I do not like people touching me as well, so being examined always pushes my personal space limits. 
0.476200	I am most anxious when there's a time that the doctor takes a long time giving me a diagnosis of my condition one time, for some reason it made me very worried and fortunately, the results were not bad compared to what I was imagining.
0.976200	i dont like crowds the last time i went the lady told me to come in the eveing hardly any people .i got there it was so crowded no were to sit anxienty was kicking in bad.went to the window she gave me a clip board to fill out paper work was so nerves i told here i couldnt be in here with all thse people she told the nurse she got me.i had to walk pass everyone it was aweul sat in a room for 2hrs to bee seen.
0.571400	That I will not get the proper care I require. I have had multiple instances where I paid for an Urgent Care visit, waited for hours to be seen, and was sent home with nothing but instructions to rest and take an OTC pill, only to end up admitted to the hospital the following day. Such instances include: heat stroke, kidney stones, broken ankle, severely infected sebacious cyst, etc. None of these instances were taken seriously by doctors in the urgent care center.
0.595200	If i really don't know whats going on and I end up in the doctors office I'm just hoping it avoids a surgery or something. If I think they cant provide me with what I need and I have to get forwarded to another doctor I may get a little anxious or worried about my next visit. Going to the doctor isn't very fun.
0.357100	Not knowing the answers are my worst fear. I feel like I want to know my results now even though sometimes that is impossible.
0.333300	Really the worst part about it to me, is taking the time out of my day to go and wait for a pointless exam that I have no reason to be examined in the first place. It's just a huge interruption every time it comes up, because its usually completely unnecessary.
0.142900	I would feel anxious if i had blood work or sometime of test . Say a disease test , They werent able to provide me with results over the phone, Made me go to the office 
0.833300	A diagnosis that i was not expecting or finding out that ive put off treatment for so long and it's worse that I thought
0.381000	what makes me the most worried when visiting my doctors office is that a necessary test or screening may be missed or a wrong result may occur from a test.
0.404800	I just don't want anything to be wrong with me.  I have a husband and two little boys and worry somewhat that something major will be wrong that we won't be able to fix.
1.000000	Most likely it's basically because I have never liked being physically touched and also because I have a fear that they will find something seriously wrong. I also don't want someone telling me that I have to change my way of doing things and I absolutely don't like being lectured to.
0.714300	I guess it is just a normal anxious thing for most everyone. The waiting is probably the biggest thing that makes me anxious. 
0.809500	There is just something about a doctor's office that is a little unnerving that I can't quite put my finger on. Everything seems a little too perfect, and I almost feel like if there's something wrong that I'm disappointing the physician or making their life harder.
0.166700	Nothing really. I am usually at ease. I guess if I had to choose one thing it would be waiting in that small room all by myself.
0.309500	I feel anxious being left in a cold room by myself for too long. It leaves me too much time to think and make myself worried
0.214300	Not knowing how unpleasant the treatment/examination might be. Also I might receive bad news. That bad news might raise the possibility of pain, suffering and unpleasant treatments.
0.142900	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is not knowing whether something serious is happening or not. I fear the worst but am unable to see whether it is true or not.
0.190500	I tend to google things a lot (big no-no) whenever I feel exceptionally bad, or have something weird going on physically, so that tends to create a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. I assume the worst. 
0.619000	I am over weight and I am always fearful that the Dr. writes he off because its my weight.. instead of looking further into y problem.
0.690500	I have a mechanical aortic valve, a dacron aortic aneurysm replacement, and a pacemaker.  The valve and graft are twelve years old, and my second pacemaker is 7 years old.  I worry the most that my valve will need to be replaced again, and that my pacemaker needs replacement again.  These things have a limited life, and I know that at some point problems that arise will need to be addressed.
0.904800	I am most worried about what diagnosis they are going to give me and what I am going to do about it.
0.642900	I am worried that they will find something wrong that I was unaware of and will result in a significant financial investment from me to treat. Our healthcare system is a joke when it comes to how much medicines cost. Your health is held for ransom by the drug companies and it's disgusting. 
0.238100	I get most anxious when waiting for a blood tests or physical exams.  I don't worry about the doctor, I worry about what could be wrong with me.
0.142900	The length of time I have to wait for my scheduled appointment time. Billing seems to be an issue a lot. I get frustrated with the lack of respect of my time.
0.166700	I think the doctor might not understand my condition. I also think that they may rush to quickly to conclusions or not fully recognize what is going on.
0.571400	That the doctor is going to find something very wrong with me.  I worry that if I am sick that I might have a serious illness. 
0.714300	You never know what to expect when you go into an appointment. Usually you are going because something doesnât feel right in your body and that worries you. With the internet nowadays you can always look up the worst case scenarios and no matter how hard you try the thought of the worst is always in your head. This scares a lot of people before they go to visit the doctor and that sometimes includes me
0.738100	Sometimes I have fear before entering the doctor's office in terms of finding a health complication that I didn't know I had before.  Usually, these examinations end well for me. 
0.714300	What makes me most anxious whenever I visit any doctor's office is uncertainty. When going to see a doctor, one never knows what may potentially arise in terms of a negative diagnosis. Thus, I am always a little bit on edge every time.
0.357100	I don't believe they have the truth. They have strayed from true health care. Prevention is key. Not pills to treat symptoms. 
0.381000	In general, my health has been good, so I usually don't fear healthcare visits.  This may change as I get older.
0.738100	I always feel like I am going to be told that my cholesterol is too high and that I need to start taking medication for it. I know this is just my doctor doing his job, but I don't like having medications pushed on me. I rather eat healthier and get more exercise.
0.571400	The anxiety from visiting a doctor's office comes from the worry that the doctor will tell me I have a serious medical problem rather than something trivia and temporary. There is also the dread about entering a hospital even to see the doctor.
0.357100	What makes me feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit is usually just my condition, hoping that it isn't something super serious or expensive to fix. Needles also make me uncomfortable, but they are a necessary evil at times.  
0.357100	I am anxious about possibly being seek, or needing a treatment. Usually I go visit during routine checkups, I am not very anxious about those. When I go when I do not feel too good, I worry about finding out if I will need a treatment. I also do not like needles, so if I have to get a shot, I feel anxious. 
0.381000	I am most anxious that I will forget to mention something- or what most people probably feel- that they will receive some bad news. In general I keep healthy habits and have not received any bad news. I am 39 so generally I do not expect to hear bad news about my health as I have not so far.
0.571400	I am just worried they will comment on something that will make me uncomfortable. I once had a Dr yell at me about my pulse rate but this was after the receptionist told me my insurance was canceled. I panicked but it was a clerical error on her part and was quickly fixed. My heart was racing and I hadnât fully calmed down yet. 
0.238100	I suppose the most anxious thing I have worried about is whether or not the doctor was in a rush. Sometimes they try and push you out and don't like being asked many questions.  
0.666700	What makes me most anxious and worried when I visit the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me and I will have some sort of health problem that I've been unaware of.
0.452400	I had a past medical history where a mysterious illness wrecked me and spent a month in the ICU, 2 weeks in a coma. So when I feel like something is wrong again, its hard to not have a bit of anxiety or worries. However when I'm at the doctor's office, I guess its mostly just being judged about poor life decisions. 
0.666700	I feel theyâre give me the same answers all the time and donât really listen or my issues. The doctor doesnât give me their best opinion and advise. They say itsuptometodecide. Iâd like to know what they think. Thatâs why I paid to go see them. 
0.571400	The only thing that really gives me any problems is thinking about the unknown and the possiblity that there could be something wrong with me that i don't know about.  This presents a small level of anxiety and fear that there could be something that is not good. 
0.523800	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. On the contrary, I want to find an answer to why I feel so bad, or something that will help me. Unfortunately, my concerns go largely ignored.
0.714300	I'm always worried that I have some serious medical condition.  I'm a hypochondriac, and I think what worries me most is being diagnosed with some horrible condition that I've never heard of.  Also, I have a bit of a fear of needles.  I'd hate to be surprised by having to take a blood test.
0.809500	That the condition I'm experiencing may require surgery or some other drastic, or painful measure. Since there's a family history and particular diseases that people with my ethnicity, and men over a certain age experience  (prostate cancer)  I fear that I may have it too. I guess to put it simple, it's the uncertainty and the fact that with certain conditions there's really nothing a patient can do to change the situation. On regular checkups, experiencing a cold or something like that  I'm not as worried since I have had many in my lifetime. I do, however, hate needles so I get antsy when I know I have to get  a shot.
0.619000	I feel anxious and worried when I am at the doctors office because I always worry of getting some disease that cant be cured or cancer I am sick all the time with ibs and I recently had hyplori I have alot of stomach issues and bowel issues so I always think of the worst outcome possible I am very anxious
0.809500	A lot of doctors don't get to the root cause of your medical issue.  They hear a few of your symptoms then give you a textbook diagnosis and send you away with a prescription for the symptoms instead of trying to solve the cause of the problem without filling you up with medication.  I want to be properly evaluated, not just medicated.
0.595200	unnecessary tests and procedures make me nervous. I don't like to have anything done that I do not feel I need.
0.381000	I do not like to visit the doctor because even when there is nothing wrong they try to medicate you to death.  It seems like they are just looking for a reason to give you all kinds of medicine that is not really needed.
0.381000	I get anxious because i'm always afraid that they are going to tell me that something  is wrong and need to change something. 
0.452400	I guess just worrying that something will turn up. That the doctor will find something that is very bad. I would say that is mostly what I worry about.
0.595200	The thing that i might not feel comfortable with the different tests that they do. Especially i don't like poking my hands for blood tests and i don't like the fact of them asking too many questions which might not be necessary.
0.142900	The things that could make me most anxious is that i am always pressed for time. The majority of the time when i go to the doctor it is a all day experience because the doctors office is so busy. SO i worry that i wont get out of there  on time to finish my day. I could also worry that there could be something wrong with me that is not fixable.
0.309500	I normally don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. One way I would feel worried is if I was experiencing great pain and had to go to the doctors office in order to stop that pain. I generally remain calm and don't expect to find anything too wrong with myself.
0.523800	I worry that he may uncover unknown ailments that could create new life challenges, or exacerbate the ones already experienced from being a type 1 diabetic.
0.738100	I always know there will be a conversation about my weight.  What makes me most anxious though is my blood pressure.  It always reacts when I'm in the doctor's office.  I've tried breathing exercises, visualization, hydrating well and distraction.  They work to a certain extent in calming me down but aren't 100% successful.  It's so annoying!  (My blood pressure is fine everywhere else but the office).  They know me well enough that they take an initial pressure and come back 10 minutes later after I've relaxed.  Totally a psychological response.
0.261900	I am always worried about two things primarily. When I enter a doctor's office, and sometimes even before, I am slowed down by the thought of the total cost of the visit. I find it very taxing to my patience that I get charged for my visit to the center, and then I get charged for my doctor's time AND THEN I get charged for my prescription. This is all of course assuming you pay the school's insurance fee which is far higher than the govt marketplace plans available to the public. The second worry I have going in is that whatever I am scheduled to have checked out will be worse than I thought. I have an acute worry that if I go check myself up the doctor will tell me oodles of things that are wrong with me, which sounds scary honestly. I suppose the second reason also ties into extra bills.
0.333300	Doctors cannot always explain what is wrong with you when you feel sick.  My brother had a serious medical condition that his doctors did not understand.  They ran a number of rests but never really understood why he was sick.
0.190500	I am most anxious about visiting a doctor's office when I have a problem related to my heart. I am worried it might be something serious.
0.214300	I worry they might find something wrong with me that is incurable. Something like cancer. Also waiting around for long periods of time will sometimes make me anxious.
0.285700	Nothing, I visit the doctor's office with they hope that they can resolve my issue, not worried that they'll make it worse.
0.214300	The only things I've every worried about when visiting a doctor are if it's a new doctor and whether or not I'm going to like them, if I see a lot of people in the waiting room and feel like it's going to be a very long appointment that is going to take up a lot of time and ruin my day, or if I feel like they are going to tell me I have some type of more serious health issue going on. I have had some doctors make me feel anxious in the past, but my main doctor has never caused me to feel that way. 
0.309500	I get slightly anxious when talking about my pre-existing condition (sleep apnea). Another thing that might make me a little bit anxious is getting a physical (for obvious reasons).  Getting weighed also makes me slightly nervous.
0.476200	I am worried that they will find something wrong with me. I don't want to be told I have high blood pressure, or something wrong with my blood work. So it makes me nervous to go. 
0.619000	If I'm seeing a doctor for a specific problem (rash or cold or pain), I think it's normal to worry about what they might find. As a general rule, going to the doctor for check-ups doesn't bother me, though I do worry they'll find something wrong sometimes.
0.595200	The alone time in the doctor's office is what makes me the most nervous. Usually when you show up you wait in that room for 30+ minutes alone. It is very cold in there, and usually the rooms are a plain white color. I become especially worried after a blood test/physical/etc when the doctor says they will return shortly and I am left alone again.
0.285700	i'm not usually worried when i go to the doctor. i'm a fairly healthy person and i can usually get a prescription to take care of anything that's going on. 
0.285700	NOthing.  I really dont require a lot of personal space or require any privacy as far as my body is concerned so I really don't care what she needs to do.  I'm also super healthy so I'm never ther for anything too crazy
1.000000	Everything.  What if I catch something while I'm there?  What if the thing I'm going to the doctor about is 10 or 100 times worse than I thought?  It's horrible.  What if they find something I wasn't even expecting?  So much worry for something that could maybe be handled at home.
0.238100	I hate the blood pressure cuff. I always get really nervous when they put the cuff on me and I have to sit there while my blood pressure gets taken. Because I get so nervous, my reading is very high.
0.476200	I just worry that something will be wrong with me or go wrong in the process. Nothing has been wrong with me yet, but I did the most worrying when I was pregnant. I thought for sure something would go wrong with the baby, but everything ended up being okay. I'm just a worrier in general.
0.142900	i don't have these feelings at the DR's . I always feel comfortable there because we have a high level of mutual trust.
0.714300	My main worry is that the doctor will not be there.  In the past 12 months I have been to my appointment each month only to have the doctor on vacation 2 of those times and one time no one was there and the door was locked.  I don't worry about what he may tell me I only worry that I wont be able to get my Rx's filled.
0.642900	A few things. I get anxious because I'm not sure I'll be able to express all of my concerns, because I'm worried they won't take my concerns seriously or will dismiss them, and because I might leave without any answers (because they don't know what is wrong). I also get anxious when talking to people anyway, and doctors are worse than most people. They are busy and I worry about taking up their time. My symptoms are weird. I'm afraid I'll just look crazy.
0.785700	I tend to feel anxious when I visit the doctor because as much as I like my doctor, I do not like going to the doctor. I am always worried that I will get bad news or a bad diagnosis of health
0.428600	I do not like to have my blood drawn so that is what makes me feel the most anxious and I worry about how test will come out. 
0.809500	The Doctor finding something very wrong, either cancer or something caused by my diabetes. I don't want to leave my family at a young age 
0.857100	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when I go to the doctor is knowing that I will probably leave with some sort of mind altering medication. I have bipolar 1. That can not be treated with therapy alone. I hate my medications and the side effects of them. I almost died because of the medications that I was given about a year or so ago. I am now horrified to try anything new when it come to medication. Though it does stop certain moods, it turns me into a vegetable that can barley function. 
0.142900	Nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when I'm visiting the doctor. I know I'm there to get checked out and I'll take the next step as it comes. 
0.714300	The doctor looking at my body makes me self conscious and I'm worried that when they're talking to me I'll look dumb
0.785700	I'm extremely private and modest. I don't like having to disrobe in front of him. It makes me feel completely awkward and uncomfortable - like I'm being judged.
0.595200	What makes me most anxious is that I feel insane. Doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. They keep telling me I'm fine and there's nothing wrong with me and making me waste time when I don't feel fine and need better medicine.
0.690500	Just the idea that something could be worse than it seems. Or that they'll berate me or something like that.
0.690500	Ever since my mother died of a rare neurological disease, I worry that something terrible is going to happen to me, especially in regard to my health.  It is a ridiculous fear, and one that I am trying to get over.  I worry about what could happen 
0.881000	Doctors have a strong and conservative mindset. They are not flexible. They can not look past the main concern and focus on something else. In my personal case, doctors can't look past my weight issues. Even though I have an entirely different medical concern that is not related to weight, they keep focusing on weight. I am also anxious because I do not like physical exams, I do not like to be completely honest because they judge you regardless.
0.785700	The single thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the fear of being diagnosed with something that I had no idea I had. I am always scared that when Iâm doing a check up theyâll find something wrong with me, but I know it is better they find it sooner rather than later.
0.738100	I just don't like the entire experience even though I know that most doctors are there to help and they really care but I don't like tests and being probed and don't like the possibility of them finding something bad.
0.309500	When I am being given shots. Since I was a child I have had a phobia of needles and do not enjoy when I need one. I understand they are important, but I still don't like them.  
0.309500	I have high blood pressure so I am always anxious about my numbers. I am a senior, so I do worry about things that a younger person would not think about. I hate tests and sometimes I have to go for them, even though I know it is in my best interest.
0.428600	I worry that something out of the ordinary will be discovered, and that I'll have some problem that I don't even know about.
0.142900	A primary concern for all of us would be the money and how much we will spend on the visit. Also thinking that there might be something terrible going on with me
0.928600	I have anxiety regularly, but I also hate being the sole focus in any situation. Plus, I don't like exposing myself due to a childhood trauma. I am sure that my distrust of my PCP adds to his anxiety. 
0.714300	I get anxious during the waiting time, I worry about the results of exams and tests I may have or need and discussions about things that may be wrong with me
0.142900	I have had unexplained pain a few times and I have been nervous wondering what it could be prior to going. I felt anxious to have tests done and get results in case it was bad news. I never felt scared to speak with my doctor though.
0.547600	It usually is what the doctors decision is. I am always worried about something serious. At my age things can go bad. 
0.714300	I'm worried but also curious, if they will find something and worried they may make a wrong choice for me.
1.000000	I consider myself a hypochondriac so when I got to the doctor I sit there imagining all the things that could be wrong with me.
0.666700	Knowing that I was unable to ascertain the cause or treatment necessary to overcome whatever the ailment happens to be. Knowing that my literal life is in another person's hands. It is an opportunity for life or death, the gravity of it gets to me.
0.238100	When I first go in, I am worried about possibly having something that wont easily be found and treated properly.
0.857100	What makes me feel most anxious and worried is the fact I may not get the proper help I want. Sometimes doctors fail to understand what I am experiencing and I end up not getting much help.
0.714300	Basically I go when I have problems . So not knowing the issues makes it worse. I feel threatened because of how uncertain everything is.  
0.452400	I dislike going to the doctors in general- I have anxiety and hate needles. I pass out when getting blood drawn, they are unsympathetic...the list could go on... 
0.547600	I just get worried that my glucose numbers are not good enough for my doctor. I'm also worried that they will find something new that's wrong with me.
0.238100	I'm worried the doctor will see something that I didnt know was a problem.  Or that something that is bothering me is more serious that it initially seems.  
0.642900	I feel anxious and worried when i visit any doctor . The reason is because i am always afraid of my health. I am afraid that doctor would say something wrong about my health
0.857100	Knowing that you don't have all the information, you need to basically take their word even if they aren't telling you the whole picture, and that you don't know what the outcome will be of certain medical procedures until after the fact.
0.404800	I would be most anxious about something being wrong with me in general. My family has many hereditary health and autoimmune problems and I have a few myself. Several members of my family have also had cancer while young and I have shown some signs of potentially developing two types of cancer in the past. I am moderately concerned and worried about the possibility of developing cancer while relatively young like several relatives. I am anxious in general about talking about myself and having myself touched by another person. I have general anxiety and just don't really like talking to people much, especially about myself.
0.357100	I'm often worried that my health may have deteriorated since my last visit. May blood pressure or weight may have gone up, or some other medical condition may have arisen.
0.642900	I don't really know what it is, I don't think it is the doctor themselves, but rather just the entire experience. I go to a hospital when I am not feeling well, so in my head, everyone is wondering what is wrong with me or why I am there. Plus, I do not want to have a time where I go to the doctor and something is very wrong with me. 
0.476200	I don't know if I will be there for an hour, waiting. If I have tests I would be anxious about the results. 
0.523800	I worry they are going to find a health condition. I'm always worried they will discover cancer. I also worry in general that my cholesterol will be too high, they will comment on my weight, and other routine health conditions. 
1.000000	I get really nervous around people in authority in general.  Add that to a situation where a person in authority is asking me all about myself what my daily life entails and it makes me extremely nervous even though I trust and respect my doctor. 
0.714300	I am always worried that the doctor may tell me that I have been diagnosed with a serious medical condition.
0.333300	My main concern and cause of anxiety is the worry that my actual illness is serious. I'm very rarely thinking about or distrusting the doctor or healthcare provider instead.
0.571400	I wouldn't want the doctor to find something negative. Also, the cost deters me from going to the doctor. Medical expenses are so exorbitant that I don't like to go to the doctor if I feel like I can avoid it.
0.238100	Again, it is not necessarily feeling these things outright and instead, just wanted to be prepared and anticipatory. Being aware increases the chances for finding the best solution. 
0.785700	That they will tell me some stuff, and it will seem to make sense, but ultimately it won't help me with any of my problems and nothing will be resolved.
0.214300	I get the most anxious in expecting a negative outcome. Aside from that I am not really anxious or worried at all about visiting the doctor's office.
0.809500	I am very overweight and I'm always worried that doctor's will disregard me or judge me when they see my size and weight. I'm very self conscious about my weight and body type, and I also worry that doctor's will just see me as a problem due to my weight. 
0.714300	I think that most people walking into a doctor's office, even if they look and feel healthy, are anxious and worried about being diagnosed with something terrible. Just a few years ago I thought that I was quite healthy and was told at the age of 30 or 31 that I had very high cholesterol and had to start taking prescription medication to address the problem.  Every time I go to the doctor I'm worried that I might learn of a similar problem.
0.142900	The battle I sometimes have to have to get them to use a manual blood pressure cuff on me instead of an automatic one.   As previously mentioned, I have severe osteoporosis due to osteogenesis imperfecta.   It is possible for the automatic one to tighten so much that it can literally fracture my arm.  Thus as the nurses' handbook for OI states, a manual blood pressure cuff should be used on folks like me.    Doctor's office staff are not used to patients coming in and insisting on the use of a manual cuff.   I don't look forward to having to go through that each time.
0.452400	If you're feeling under the weather and the cause is not immediately apparent, resulting in tests - and you need to wait on test results before treatment can be decided.
0.523800	The unknown, not knowing if what health check up could turn up or progress into something worse or more intense. Anxiety hits everyone, and just going to one would incur a little bit of worry or doubt when getting checked out and evaluated.
0.238100	Going to the doctor is like taking your car to the mechanic. There could always be something seriously wrong that will require time and money to fix. In this case, my health is the most important, so of course I am concerned the doctor would find something bad under my hood.
0.833300	I do not like to be exposed to other people's germs in the waiting room.  If I have something other than a routine condition, I often feel worried about the unknown.
0.738100	i am always worried that the doctor would tell me i have cancer or some other awful disease . the worst case  scenario is always in the back of my mind, im often a little anxious at the doctors office.i worry also about catching a virus from a previous patient because alot of people who go to the doctors office are very sick.
0.571400	I feel like everyone nowadays ends up with cancer or some other huge disease, even when symptoms aren't present. I am generally very healthy, but I do worry about the doctor finding something abnormal that may not have presented symptoms. I like to be in control and have a fear of the unknown. 
0.214300	I typically am not very anxious when I go to the doctor. The only time that I do worry is when I'm not sure what's going on with me. As I typically don't get sick, this is not really an issue for me. 
0.595200	I worry that there will be something wrong with me, something that will cost a lot of money to fix and I would not be able to cover the medication or procedure. I do not going to hospitals in general so that does not help my situation at all.
0.619000	I'm always afraid that I will get bad news and it worries we every time I go to the Dr's office. I have a great doctor and he always lets me know what I need to do.
0.690500	I do not feel comfortable going to the doctor's office. Health issues make me feel tense and anxious. I am not sure about the reason. Probably is the possibility of finding something new about my health.
0.666700	I am generally in good health so I don't need to visit the doctor's often.  When I do, it's usually for something that has me quite worried so it's just that.
0.619000	Never know if when going for a checkup for one thing, some other thing could be discovered. I guess the anxious feeling is that i do not fully understand everything that could be happening in my body until a checkup
1.000000	I have white coat syndrome. Going to the doctor's no matter what it is for makes me anxious or worried. I feel my blood pressure raising. There could be nothing wrong, but a cold and I still get all worked up.
0.642900	Learning the results of tests that I've had taken. I usually get scheduled for tests like cat scans to check my lungs. Waiting til my next appointment to learn the results of those tests makes me anxious to the point of almost being sick to my stomach.
0.142900	I have always been very nervous when I go to a doctor appointment. So that means when I sit down, and they take my blood pressure, it is sky high.
0.357100	Other than a routine physical the older i get the more i worry that there will be something wrong. I feel that the older i get the more i work to maintain a better state of health. In an emergency i am generally fearful of what the doctor is going to say.
0.166700	I have white coat syndrome.  Any Doctors office makes me nervous, you feel like you're being judged.  I have gotten mostly over that but a new doctor will still make me feel that way. When I was younger I had a particular doctor that talked down to me and was unkind and it stuck with me for a long time.
0.357100	I might get bad news or something unforeseen will rise and i might not be able to handle it. The thought of getting cancer has always frightened me. Even getting a dangerous virus has always scared me.
0.523800	I think the scariest thing is not knowing what the result of your test are going to be. Even if you feel super healthy and you are living a healthy lifestyle nobody can be 100% sure that they are healthy 
0.476200	I think that all people who go to a medical practice feel the same as me. Perhaps the patient goes with a slight abdominal discomfort and in the consultation discovers that it was not something so light what he felt but it was or is a serious and delicate disease. However, I recommend taking this risk and going to the doctor. That will always be the best option.
0.690500	In general, I would feel anxious because I would not be sure what the diagnosis would be.  Also, I'm always worried about having to buy medicine or take time off of work.  So I always feel apprehensive until I find out what the problem and treatment is.
0.714300	That they are going to perscribe me something generic that only helps maybe 10% of my issue or just tell me to take it easy and if it gets worse call like i came out here for a answer not to be told im nuts
0.785700	I had cancer 8 years ago, so I naturally worry that something might develop, or perhaps secondary cancers from my treatment.  I also am embarrassed about my weight, although I am on a walking program and am doing the best I can.
0.690500	I usually feel anxious and worried when I am unsure of the outcome of a diagnosis. When I am going to see a doctor for a concern with my health and I don't yet know the diagnosis, that makes me very uneasy. The other thing that makes me worried about visiting doctors, is the doctor themselves at times. Because I don't know the doctor personally and I am unsure of what type of person they are and how they maybe professional or not. 
1.000000	The doctor always takes a long time but they're always in a rush to leave. They always write things down but don't communicate. They don't make eye contact and they're always leaving and entering. 
0.428600	I guess when I go to the doctor I am scared that they will find something really bad, as I have had cervical cancer and it came back 3 times.  I try not to be negative but it just worries me.
0.142900	I usuall don't worry too much. The uncertainty of what may be found this time pops into my head but it is a minor issue.
0.381000	I just feel anxious sometimes that i may get bad news.  They may find cancer or something serious that i was not expecting that could be life changing.
0.714300	I think the fear that something might be wrong with me is the worst. The scary thing is that even if you think it's something small it might turn into something huge. I can see why people try to avoid it.
0.571400	I would be worried about how I'm going to pay for the visit, and whether the problem would turn out to be something that I would never be able to pay for. 
0.381000	always worry about going to the doctor. some tests can show somthing is wrong even when you have no symptoms so that always gives me a little anxiety until i know what is going on fully
0.333300	Finding out from the doctor that I have medical condition is what makes me most anxious or worried.  The medical condition may require taking medicine or seeing a specialist.  I always feel relieved when I go to the doctor for a physical and it turns out that nothing is wrong with me.
0.714300	I just never really know what to expect and I feel that it is a waste of time. There has been wrong diagnoses in the past with people, so who knows. It's like flipping a coin. I'd be more worried about what the doctors says if anything.
0.523800	I feel anxious about telling things to the doctor because I always feel like the doctors don't believe me or think my concerns are not important. I also feel anxious if I have to be undressed for an exam.
0.809500	I seem to get very anxious when seeing my doctor because I always forget what I need to tell them. I am usually worried about what I may find out at that visit. I sometimes feel worried that the doctor may think I am a little crazy because I do not know how to explain a certain symptom. I am sure they know most of the time what the patient is talking about as they have normally seen that problem before. But with myself I am not good at explain a certain pain or feeling. But as far as actually walking in the office and talking with the staff I always feel comfortable. 
0.357100	I am getting older. I don't have any of their difficulties, but pretty much all the males on my dad's side had high pressure, diabetes, and potential for heart disease.
0.500000	"I am most concerned of a ""worst case scenario"" that I have built up in my head when a medical condition has become severe."
0.142900	Nothing does as I do not go to the doctors at all. If i were to go to the doctors it would be something very serious that I need to get checked out with tests, so I would be worried about whatever I was getting tested for. 
0.690500	I am worried sometimes when I visit that my weight will be more than the previous visit.  I am worried to he get onto me possibly about the weight.  I am worried that the blood work could show some issues like high cholesterol.  I am worried that the blood test could show high liver levels which could be fatty liver. I am worried my blood pressure could be elevated.  The blood pressure maybe just elevated during that time because I am nervous about our visit.  Usually tho I feel very comfortable with my Dr.  
0.904800	When I see one of my specialists I am afraid she will find that something is wrong and that I will require surgery.  I have already had four of them for a medical condition I have.  She is a great, caring doctor but the fear of the unknown is the worst part.  I have an anxiety disorder as well so that makes the experience even worse.
0.523800	I know there is always the chance of bad news. I do not put my self in the expectative state of mind, but I am aware of the possibility.
0.452400	I worry that he will find something wrong with me that I am not aware of.  I get a little anxious when he runs tests and I am not sure why he feels they are needed.  I don't like the explanation that he runs them for all patients in my age group.  I understand that he is pro-active, but sometimes it worries me.
0.523800	The unknown is what worries me.  It's the idea of the doctor finding something wrong that could be potentially serious and leads to a bad outcome regardless of what a doctor can do.
0.238100	If I am not feeling well not knowing what is causing me to feel ill makes me anxious and worried. After the prognosis and diagnosis I start to settle down and relax. 
0.142900	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is my skin appearing to be in need of hydration. I never want to appear to my doctor as being as ashy.
0.166700	I just don't like going to the doctors office. I am a very healthy person, but the process of being in the doctors office does generate a very small amount of anxiety. Mostly the long waits. After I meet with the doctor, all is good.
0.214300	What makes me feel worried is just the anticipation about whatever could be ailing me being worse than I thought it was. I would not want anything serious to happen to me in that case.
0.238100	I don't really get nervous that much. It's more about shots. I hate getting shots and i'm terrified of needles. That's really the only reason. Getting my flu shot was hell LOL.
0.142900	I dont like getting blood tests. That is truly my only fear. Overall, i would say that I have no fear of the doctor. I am in generally decent health overall, so i dont have much to fear. 
0.357100	I feel anxious because I want to be better but most times I have something new that arises and adds to my disease debt. I try to remain optimistic but until they give you a positive result it is hard to do that so most times I am waiting on them to say something negative. I also just don't like waiting long lengths of time for the doctor to arrive. More times than not the doctor visit will require a needle for blood work so that makes me anxious as well. I am presented with multiple people before seeing the doctor which makes me feel like I have a huge problem that many people have to deal with. I just don't like having bad news.
0.881000	"I worry that the doctor will not take my concerns and thoughts seriously. I worry that I will be ignored and the doctor will think he knows what is best for me without listening to what I have to say.  I worry that the doctor will try to fit me into a ""box"" typical of other patients he treats and not treat me as an individual."
0.428600	I do not usually feel this way but when I do it is usually because I know what I am in for. I typically like to spend time self diagnosing before a visit to the doctor. I usually anticipate the most likely outcomes. I even watch the procedures online in so cases. Knowing whats coming and seeing it become my reality is a little nerve wracking. I get a little anxious from procedures involving me being naked. I think that is just uncomfortable in any case. I also do not enjoy pain so knowing I am getting some stitches can cause some anxiety. 
0.381000	To put it simply... fear of the unknown.  Everyone goes through this, unless they're a psychopath (I actually kind of envy them for that).  If you don't know what's wrong, and you don't know how serious it is, you're going to have that fear.  I's normal.  I'm actually wondering why this question is even necessary.  
0.642900	I would hate to learn that I have a dreaded disease that I didn't know about. I would like to think that my lifestyle would keep me from having a bad disease.
0.214300	I feel dirty when I go into a doctors waiting room. And especially in the back room where you see the doctor. I think of all the sick people that are in the same area and it makes me feel very dirty. Like I need to take a shower as soon as possible or something.
0.738100	My family medical history and not very great, so I am fearful that I will get diagnosed with something. Anytime I feel less than perfectly healthy I have a small amount of concern. Being in a doctors office is often an uncomfortable experience in general.
0.976200	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I could possibly be put on medication for the rest of my life, treating any condition instead of being able to cure it.
0.333300	I mostly have positive feelings when a doctor is examining me because if I get a clean bill of health, then obviously, that's a positive result but even if the dr does find something wrong, I'd rather know about it so that I can do what I need to to overcome it.
0.285700	There have been times when a test or exam turned up something questionable that needed to be explored with further tests. I have had a few cancer scares. Those times were anxious for me, because I knew there was a possibility I would have cancer. Thankfully, I never did.
0.142900	"While I have never really experiences the sensation of anxiety or worry when visiting a doctor or health care provider, I can definitely imagine why many people are apprehensive.  Many people are worried that the treatment may hurt or feel uncomfortable during the exam.  People may also be scared to hear the truth regarding their condition and be in a state of ""ignorance is bliss"".  These factors cause people to not only worry and become anxious, but to also not follow up or seek treatment for their condition or ailments."
0.142900	I am not anxious, but I have had a biopsy before and that did cause a bit of anxiety. In that case it was just hoping that the biopsy was benign and not cancer. The anxiety stems from unknown health problems that could be present.
0.428600	I have had health concerns in the past and I worry about things that may come up again when I go to see the doctor.  Since I do not know what he is going to tell me, I naturally am anxious about what I am about to hear.  Those who say they are not anxious are either lying, or just ignorant about what can happen to peope as they get older.  I work in a profession that has a lot of people having health issues and these concerns travel with me when I go in to see the doctor as well.
0.904800	I do not know what my current symptoms are, and how they effect the rest of my illnesses.  I dread going on new medicine.  I already take 9 presecriptions
1.000000	I am very nervous about having my body violated or put through examinations that I am not consenting to. Many times doctors have forced me to succumb to treatment that I explicitly said I didn't want, so I have constant anxiety about seeing them. I have been sent away in a police car too many times by care providers that refuse to give me the treatment I need.
0.809500	Worried that they'll find something seriously wrong - or worse, they'll miss something seriously wrong. Worried that they'll suggest I change my lifestyle in ways that make me unhappy.
0.666700	Thinking if they are really up to the task and willing to devote their full attention. If not, I may end up suffering from their incompetence and the lack of work ethic.  
0.809500	I feel that sometimes when I go to the doctor, I might not get what I am looking for right away. I also fear if I can afford it or if I am diagnose with something that can hurt my health and my future. 
0.142900	I always feel like they may tell me something I dont want to hear or something thats going to be hard for me to correct. I dont like bad news and I never want to hear bad news at all
0.619000	I was always somewhat anxious about all of my prenatal visits. I had struggled with infertility and had experienced a miscarriage prior, so everything related to the pregnancy made me nervous. It wasn't specific to the doctor. 
0.309500	I just get anxiety and my chest tightens up.  I am not sure why.  I have high blood pressure and it is always worse when I visit the doctor.  
0.714300	I don't trust them.  I always feel like I'm taking a chance when I go to see them.  I always question whether anything that they want to do is appropriate.  I always assume that anything negative I've been told in a doctor's office is just a starting point, that verification of anything I've been told will require a lot of research on my part and possibly even a trip to another doctor (who will probably contradict the first doctor).  
0.142900	Going to the doctor's office can be a real source of anxiety. ... examination, then all that time sitting there is probably making you dwell on your worries 
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. The only scenario I can imagine this might happen to someone is they go to a new doctor and don't know what to expect or happen.
0.833300	I am most anxious about the cause of the problems I'm having as well as whether or not I'm wasting money with a particular doctor who won't address the problems until other costly procedures have been completed. 
0.404800	I worry that a doctor will not fully understand my pain or symptoms. I feel anxious about being overprescribed medication or receiving unnecessary medical treatments that I'll have to pay for.
0.642900	Finding out about something that may be a short term or long term sickness.  Having to change my lifestyle for a long term or permanent time.
0.428600	I have a family history of diabetes and heart disease. As much as I take care of myself, I am worried that I would get a diagnosis that is not in my favor.
0.285700	"I always have this general feeling that I will receive bad news when I visit the doctor's office even though I usually don't. I'm a healthy individual. But there's always a sense of ""What don't I know?"" that might pop up. Receiving test results always makes me a bit anxious because of a false positive test that I received one time in my life."
0.785700	I am just an anxious person anyway, so anytime I have to go see my doctor I usually feel this way. I feel like when the doctor walks in he is going to give me the worst news ever, but it is not like that at my usual doctors appointments.
0.690500	If I'm sick, I'm not sure what the diagnosis is, that makes me very anxious for obvious reasons. I'm most nervous when getting tested for STDs/HIV because I'm part of an at risk population, but I do my best to minimize that risk. I don't really get uneasy or uncomfortable talking personal bodily or hygienic stuff because to me that's expected in a medical setting.
0.833300	Mainly that being sick sucks and there are any number of things that could go wrong. It's no fault of the doctor's and is inherent to my own temperament. 
0.142900	I am worried whether my weight, blood pressure, white blood cell will change for the worse. When I go for a screening whether it will show something I do not want to know I can fight.
0.595200	I really know what the doctor or nurse is going to say to me. If I gain a few pounds I feel like they are saying 'lose the weight fatty'. Also when it came to my mental problems they want to push drugs than get to a solutions so I worried they are just going to turn me into a zombie on drugs.
0.238100	I think he will give me some bad news about my bloodwork or that I've gained too much weight.  Ultimately though it always goes better than expected.
0.523800	Sometimes I go into a doctor fearing the worst when I go into see him. There have been times in the past with previous doctors that their first diagnoses wasn't always the correct one. For that reason alone I'm weary sometimes.
0.404800	ONE THING THAT MAKES ME ANGRY OR WORRIED IS ABOUT THE HEALTH TIPS WHENEVER THEY PROVIDE ME , BUT I FOLLOW THEM RARELY WITH THAT WHILE I GO FOR A CHECKUP I AM SACRED ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE .
0.642900	My health isn't stellar, and I often worry that there's going to be a new condition pop up that I haven't had to contend with before. 
0.404800	Last years diagnoses of cancer and then surgery and then a good diagnoses that they had caught it early.  That does make my appointments more stressful than before.  I think even before that that you wonder or worry more about your health as you get older.
0.833300	Whenever I get a physical exam of course I get anxious because anyone can have hidden problems within their body and you never know what may be found at each exam. So as much as I want to stay ahead of the game I dread it every time.
0.238100	Nothing really. I just go there and they take care of things. It takes a bit of extra time out of my day but it's only a hour. 
0.190500	I think that will find something else wrong with me. I know that they want to make as much money as possible off of me, and so they will do everything they can to find something else.
0.238100	If I have something that I know has been bothering me for a while that could potentially be major then I worry a little more about it.  If it's just a routine ache then I don't let it get to me at all.  However, if it is something that is deeper say in the chest or stomach area that could be serious then I'm more likely to worry.
0.714300	Doesn't everyone hate to go to the doctor? I know that being weighed is necessary for medicine doses and determining overall health, but I'd go a lot more if they didn't weigh me every time. If I'm a couple pounds over my last visit weight, I'll do everything I can to lose it before going to the doctor, or just not go. I suspect this is very common.
0.571400	Iâm most anxious that lab results will have indicate I need some kind of medication.  I worry about my blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzymes but so far they are OK. 
0.738100	The amount of pain expected from some medical procedures is a cause of worry. Also, being told that there could be an abnormality in some test results. The cost of the visit or tests needed is also bothersome.
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried.  I have not had any serious health issues to date.  I sometimes get a little anxious waiting for blood test results.
0.357100	"I feel like there is a chance that something could be wrong with me and I need to brace myself for some sort of bad news. This can make me feel a little bit anxious when I see a new doctor. Sometimes I also worry that the doctor won't take me seriously because I look ""rough"". I have been pegged as ""drug seeking"" simply because of how I look. This has happened even though I am not even wanting any type of medication and I am a drug and alcohol counselor per profession."
0.571400	I think its probably fear of the unknown... or if I know or think I know what's going on, its a fear of dealing with the issue and what comes with it.
0.881000	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I worry that she will criticize me for not having lost weight or exercising enough.
0.285700	Visiting the doctors office rarely makes me feel anxious. If at some point I do feel anxious it might be because the doctor will tell me that I will have to undergo treatment that is not the most convienient for me at the time or I am unfortunately diagnosed with a condition that is not curable. 
0.595200	That I will not be believed when I say I am in pain outside of the normal, that they will decide things about my health based on my appearance rather than my symptoms or not do the right testing because they think they know what my problem is without checking
0.381000	I worry sometimes that I will explain something badly pertaining to my medical condition or forget something important even if I write it down or even say too much thereby causing my doctor to send me in for tests or more prescriptions.
0.714300	Most of the time I feel dread and anxious because I'm scared of what they will find out and the cost of the visits and treatments. I'm also scared of their opinions of me in regards to taking care of myself the proper way.
0.452400	My biggest fear is that he would find something really wrong and need me to come back for further treatment. I guess that's a good thing in general, as I would be identifying a health problem... so I guess the anxiety would come from the possibility of having that problem at all.
0.404800	I think what makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what the physician is going to say to me and if they physician wants to prescribe medications or have me undergo any tests, such as blood tests or sonograms.
0.381000	I don't ever feel overly anxious. I usually go when I need to have an ailment treated with medication. Diagnosis is normally simple and routine. 
0.714300	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is the same thing I just stated in the prior narrative, is that I am concerned that physicians are primarily in the drug business and always looking to push drugs. I know that pharmaceutical companies incentivize physicians to prescribe drugs for pretty much everything and so I always fear that there is a âwitch huntâ in progress as a physician to look for reasons to prescribe and considers which drugs to use.
0.904800	Nothing that the doctor did or said, but mostly what I might have wrong with me. I am naturally anxious in these types of situations because I always fear the worst, and getting any sort of negative medical news can be devastating for me. 
0.190500	Mentally I am relaxed, but even benign medical procedures like taking my blood pressure can produce stress responses in me.  It's also difficult when they take blood, my veins are uncooperative and so it's typically a difficult process
0.785700	I think what make me anxious is just the whole environment of being at the doctor's office. It is not a comfortable feeling at all. It makes me feel very anxious. Further it makes me worried because I always feel like they are going to say things that are terrible. Or that the doctor is going to do tests I do not want nor like. In all the atmosphere of the doctor's office makes me anxious at best. It is not a good feeling. It just evokes bad feelings and the want to not even go. The anticipation sitting in the examination room waiting for the doctor not only creates anxiety but also worry. I have never been to the doctor's office and can say I felt at ease and calm. The whole experience of going to the doctor is just not conducive of good feelings. 
0.619000	I feel anxious when I walk into a new doctor office. I also hate going to some doctors because they are slow or way too quick in my opinion.
0.142900	I typically am not worried when I go to see the doctor as I am ready to face any medical condition I might have. I don't particularly look forward to prostate exams during my annual physical I guess.
0.333300	"For the past couple of years my Dr has been monitoring some ""suspicious nodules "" in my lung. So I always dread going in after having the xrays or Cat Scans done to monitor it. My dad died of lung cancer so it scares me and I dread going in to find out if its ok or not"
0.285700	If the doctor hesitate to tell me about my health reports after examination i would feel most anxious and worried.
0.452400	That a symptom is more than I thought it was. That they're going to judge me for something and give me worse care. That they'll do something that my insurance doesn't cover and I won't realize it until I get a huge bill.
0.428600	I am always worried about bad news or if something is seriously wrong with me. It's always anxious when you find out something is wrong with you or if you need to change something in your diet.
0.261900	It's uncomfortable to go to the doctor period. I get anxious from the time I call to set an appointment, to the time I leave. Fortunately, I don't go to the doctor enough to not be anxious. I don't think it's because I fear they will find something wrong, but just that it is an uncomfortable situation.
0.833300	I am always worried that a doctor is not going to hear what I am telling them or ignore my symptoms and play them down.  Then I get a huge bill a few weeks later.  I often felt like I was scammed or taken advantage of. This has happened so many times in the past.  
0.738100	I am pretty anxious in general, but working in healthcare, I feel I know a lot of the bad things that can happen. It's hard for me to get some of those things out of my head.
0.142900	I'm not anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's for an exam. I don't really like waiting and I dread the expense, but nothing about the appointment itself gets my very worried
0.595200	I worry that the doctor will find something going on in me that I will not be able to afford the treatment for, or that the treatment will have serious side effects. I worry that the doctor might see something embarrassing or shame me for being overweight.
0.619000	I worry that something is going to be wrong with me that I can not fix.  I don't like waiting in the waiting room or in the exam room.  I usually can't wait to get out of there.  
0.428600	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor, I feel like I am wasting my time. I'm not worried either.
0.690500	I always assume the worst. I usually think that something is going to come back worse then what I initially went to the doctor for.
0.333300	depends on why I'm there, last time was for my back sciatica and I was expecting a worse case thing because the pain was severe, but it turned out not to be a major issue and in a few months I was good again
0.738100	I am always nervous about what they are going to say about my health or my conditions.  I generally never really get anything to positive, so I always try to prepare myself for what is to come.  If I get a good report, then I'd rather be pleasantly surprised, then be hopeful and become disappointed.  
0.571400	Just the not knowing if anything unexpected may show up in some kind of test or blood work.  You just never know when some type of medical problem that is unexpected happens.
0.547600	I am not sure. I guess it would be if it is just a check up or for a specific reason. If it is for a specific reason then I am always worried about what they may find or tell me.
0.476200	Its just embarassing. I am a modest person, so having ANYONE see me naked or half dressed is stressful
0.571400	I don't like anything to change my schedule.  When I go to the doctor I feel anxious and worried.  But, the doc is friendly enough I relax.  I just want to get everything done.
0.690500	I am considered about my taste of health and an uneasy as to what new concerns might popup when visiting the doctor's office. I get worried about what the test results might show and am somewhat apprehensive about get the results back.
0.285700	Nothing, really.  There's the 1% chance that I might get blindsided by bad news, but that is very unlikely.  The only somewhat realistic concern I might have is if I was diagnosed with a condition that runs in my family, especially ones I'm actively trying to avoid.
0.642900	Not knowing what the outcome of what i am there for. Telling me things that i am probably not going to want to hear. Being told i am doing something wrong. I feel anxious not knowing the results of tests i have had taken. Prescribing pills that have side effects is nerve wracking.
0.833300	 Going to the doctors always has a component of dread for me. I fear my test results in particular after a period when I have let myself go physically or not watched my diet carefully. My particular fears are; cancer and signs of cognitive decline. My cholesterol is another concern as it is nearly always just outside the parameters and I am nearly always chided for that. I am diabetic but my A1c results have been consistently good for many years now. I dread going to the psychiatrist for anxiety meds because I really feat mental aging and there is nearly always a test for that involved with the visit.
0.190500	The feeling that something could be wrong that I dont know about that the doctor realizes is what makes me most anxious when visting the doctors office.
0.642900	If my doctors find something unusual if i visit them that makes me worried. Once they find out that my certain blood level is not in sync i can't just ignore them most of the time they look after their patient. Also just going to visit doctors itself is worrisome. The thought it self will make me thinking if they find out something going on with me and then i have to go through other diagnostics taste. That takes time, money and more stress for my family.
0.785700	The uncertainty over the possibilities of what health issues could arise or be identified, not knowing what outcomes are possible and may occur.
0.476200	what makes you feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just general anxiety. Or general worry nothing specific
0.738100	When I go to the doctor for something that could be serious, this is when I get worried or anxious. I hate not being in control of a situation and I think for me not knowing is what worries me.
0.500000	The uncertainty of not knowing whatâs making me feel ill, of having something very hurtful or that may result in a painful procedure or that might cost a lot of money.
0.714300	Well I am an anxious person to begin with so just having to go to the doctor is already enough to make me anxious. Plus it makes me feel vulnerable and uncomfortable sitting there being examined, often times in that flimsy robe thing. On top of that there is the overall worry of what might be wrong with you.
0.857100	I'm most worried about what the process is going to be and how awkward it'll feel. I'm more comfortable with a woman being my doctor and I have a male doctor, so I'm slightly uncomfortable.I'm also worried about if something is going to be found wrong.
0.571400	I feel anxious or worried sometimes when  visiting the doctor because I am unsure if my illness may be something worse. I also get worried that I will receive bad news about my health at some point during the visit. I never fully calm down until I have left the office with a good bill of health.
0.547600	I am worried about the diagnosis I may receive and whether or not I will be able to afford the treatment or medications I need. My main concern is the cost of treatment.
0.547600	Not knowing what to expect when meeting with a new doctor. This applies to meeting new people in general, especially those with some authority (ex.: new boss).  Meeting new people always makes me a bit nervous.
0.547600	Not knowing what my condition is like and the chances of getting some news that might make me worry. Also I worry about the length of time it might take, because often I've waited ridiculous amounts of time. 
0.595200	When I go to the doctor since I have hypothyroidism, I usually have to get lab work.  I have small veins so it can be difficult to draw labs sometimes.  I usually get anxious more about this than anything else.  There isn't usually anything the doctor did, but just don't always enjoy the tests they put you through.
0.428600	The fact that they're staring at me, listening to every word, makes me feel pressured and anxious.  I am afraid that I might accidentally forget something I need to tell them regarding symptoms or such.  I get particularly worried when I tell them my symptoms and they look at me like I'm a crazy person over-reacting.
0.452400	I feel anxious because I do not care being around doctors or nurses.  I feel as thought I am a healthy person and do not need to be in a doctors office for checkups.  I simply don't care to go to the doctor for any reason.
0.690500	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is finding out if there is something serious going on with my body, as well as not always knowing my exact medical health and finding out something terrible.
0.285700	I think the worst is when you go into the doctor's office and you feel bad and you are not sure what the doctor is going to say.
0.500000	Generally speaking, I am fine going to the doctor's office unless I am waiting on test results for something or expected to have blood drawn, which I hate. I was the most anxious/worried when I was pregnant, as I had a number of manageable issues arise. Each time I went for another appointment, I feared the news of something else.
0.738100	I get just anxious about seeing and being around people. I don't know what it is. Afraid of things that could happen but I know they won't. 
0.357100	I'm not quite sure what it is, but every time I go to a doctors appointment I always feel a little trepidation. Its not that I'm worried they will find something wrong with me, but there is just always this sense of anticipation. It is completely illogical, and I know it. Maybe its perhaps that even though doctors are associated with caring for one's health, they are also associated with sickness and disease. 
0.619000	mainly just being at the office knowing that i may have to get blood drawn or something, or if i have to get a pap test that makes me very anxious b/c it is painful
0.285700	I am usually pretty good when going to the doctor.   I do get anxious waiting for them to come into the room but that is more due to me hating sitting there cold in the gown waiting and nothing to do with the actual appointment
0.523800	I feel anxious that maybe i have not taken care of myself as much as i should and that it may have lead to some form of problem that i do not notice that needs to take care of. I have had conditions in the past that i worry may come back
0.642900	I always worry that they will diagnose with something different illness or if they will prescribe some different medicine which at the end might have some sided effects.   
0.142900	Usually it's just stepping on the scale and seeing that it has crept on up again.  That and wondering if my blood pressure will be up or down.  I have no problems with any physical exam she may give, but of course may be anxious to find out what is causing the symptoms - whether it's serious for my health or just a minor problem.
0.976200	I get anxious when I worry about whether the doctor will assist me in a way that I personally agree with or if they will demand I do things that are out of my comfort zone, such as taking medications I do not wish to take or taking tests that I find to be dangerous.
0.500000	Right now I'm uneasy because the treatment that has worked for me in the past is being denied to me, and the new treatment has caused a 50 lb weight gain (I was a perfectly healthy, trim weight before!). And when that comes up, doctors don't like to acknowledge the treatments I am on are the main culprit of the weight gain. They just blame me, which is dumb since I have ALWAYS been trim, and was looking good at 45 before all these stupid treatments. 
0.500000	In general I always get tense visits to the doctors because I always think the worst of my diagnoses and it makes me nervous to think about the results, it is a tense situation and I think it is something that all patients experience
0.547600	The doctor might be concerned about what symptoms I've been having. I never know when my health might change. 
0.523800	Usually I go to the doctorâs office for a reason â recently I had a skin cancer diagnosis â so Iâm obviously concerned about the results of a visit. Also, Iâm kind of getting tired of the hassle of healthcare. I have a growth that needs looked at â I know thatâs going to be at least four visits. The initial visit, another visit to get the growth removed, another visit to have a follow-up (either stitches removed or just a wound check for healing), and another check in a couple of months to make sure nothing is growing back. Iâm not anxious about regular check-ups very much.
0.785700	They will tell me what I am doing wrong based off of what other people in my race do. A doctor told me to stop in fried chicken when that is something I rarely eat. Not all people of color eat or like fried chicken.
0.619000	A male OB/GYN threatened to impregnate me during an examination. He said he was joking, but I didn't go back to an OB/GYN for years after that because I would start to feel anxious while trying to make an appointment
0.166700	I don't really get anxious or worried at the doctor most of the time. Sometimes if I have a problem that could be potentially serious I'll feel uncomfortable, but that has only happened once or twice. I also don't really like undressing at the doctor, but I opt not to and my doctor is fine with it.
0.285700	I do not like to wait for test results to say what is going on with my overall health I like to know right away what is happening and going on .
0.881000	In my experience people go to the doctor because something is wrong. As someone who has an anxiety disorder anyway, going to someone who can confirm that a problem is real and something could be terribly wrong just stresses me completely out. 
0.309500	I usually don't get anxious.  They only times that I really am worried or anxious is if I know I am going to a dr. that doesnt listen to me or I think won't.  Or if it is for one of my children and I know something is wrong with them.
0.761900	I am not e needle person. In fact my chart lets the nurses know I have a hard time with needles. I have high blood pressure, and have to get my blood drawn every now and then, so I worry about that.
0.523800	Just knowing that I may end up with a doctor who does not really want to take the time to listen to my complaints and will just try to push some drug on me makes me anxious.  I am not relaxed going in just thinking about that.
0.833300	because I have so many different problems with my health I don't know what is going to be next because it seems like every time I go to the doctor something else is wrong
0.476200	I think I feel apprehensive whenever I have to reschedule an appointment or have to wait far longer than anticipated prior to seeing the doctor or when having to wait while s/he checks on a particular result.
0.523800	what makes me more anxious or worry is knowing if i'm good or if i'm gonna need take pills, have an illness that is hard to cure.
0.738100	In most cases the cause of anxiety is usually the uncertainity sorounding a test whose outcome is unknown. We do not have control over outcomes of tests and however compassionate the physician is, I always get worried. I believe it's normal though.
0.761900	I think that doctors ask many questions. Also, they search for abnormalities. This can make me feel uneasy because I don't know what the next observation or diagnosis will be regarding my health issues. Also, I feel uneasy when I have to have my blood pressure checked. 
0.952400	Even though it hasn't been diagnosed, I'm certain that I've got some form of an anxiety disorder, so I'm pretty much always on edge when visiting the doctor's office. I'm a pretty modest person (and being asexual probably doesn't help this), so anything that involves getting a little too touchy-feely makes me extremely uncomfortable. For instance, I know that I should really visit a gynecologist or the like, but the thought of it freaks me out too much. I actually took far longer than I should have to go to the doctor about my IBS before I knew what it was, because I was afraid that I'd have to have a colonoscopy or something similar (as mentioned earlier, I was fortunate that my doctor also suffers from it, so as soon as I started talking about my symptoms, she knew exactly what it was).
0.690500	Mainly I worry that my good luck has finally run out and they find a major medical issue that has to be dealt with.  Possible crippling financial costs of a discovered medical issue causes me considerable worry.
0.142900	I feel nervous when something is physically wrong with me and I have no idea what it is. I get nervous when I know it could be a costly visit as well. 
0.857100	I am always anxious and worried so it would be no different in the doctor's office. I guess I would be concerned that I would find out that I had some incurable disease or something at the doctor's office.
0.547600	When the doctor recommends that I take some medication that I am not very familiar with. I read about some possible side-effects but my doctor does not seem very affected by that. That makes me worried because I'm unsure if something may be a big deal or not.
0.285700	Aside from the tedious visits which is a constant reminder that I am a cancer patient, I have no qualms other than that I do not work and my income is low which makes daily living sometimes unbearable.  I was a vibrant 62 year old with my own home a gorgeous leased vehicle and then in an instant I was a cancer patient.  It was not how I envisioned my life to be and was hopeful that I would work until full retirement age of 66 or later.  Visiting the cancer center is not a big deal.
0.261900	Iâm generally not worried about going to the doctorâs office. I would only become worried if a doctor gave me a reason to be after an examination. I donât necessarily go into the appointment worried 
0.285700	I always have a fear in the back of my mind of finding something wrong about my health. Both sides of my parents have a history of diabetes, and my mother's side have a history of cancer so anytime I go for a check up I worry about finding out that I may have it.
0.523800	I worry because when I go to the doctor it is usually because i have been having some symptoms and the doctor is going to tell me what is wrong, and I dont want anything to be wrong
0.714300	I don't like when there is something wrong with me and I don't know what it is. My fears get the best of me and I worry a lot.
0.595200	Thinking about whether I can explain my condition exactly or not is one thing that makes me anxious. Expressing condition is difficult. Also, when getting result of test, I will be anxious because there is no grantee if the result is good one. Especially after having PAP test and mammography, I become so anxious to hear the result.
0.404800	will not get the information I need because we all know they spend very little time with each client
0.285700	What makes me anxious about the doctors office is more so when they make you wait and wait in the examining room to see the doctor.  It's the physical atmosphere of the sterile environment that gets to me if I have to sit in that little room too long.  I'm not anxious about actually seeing the doctor because he is familiar to me and I trust him completely.  It's the equipment and the environment I don't like.
0.476200	That I will end up with another short term solution and no clear answer. In three months I will be in the same situation and he will just do the same thing and I don't see progress.
0.428600	Just getting routine check ups makes me nervous because I have been really sick as of late. I had a tumor before and lately I have been sick along those same lines again.
0.547600	Their standard assessment equipment sometimes causes errors in obtaining vital signs.  The doctor often will not re-check the vitals and my anxiety usually causes my blood pressure to read higher than it is. I get anxious when they try to give me new medication for something that hasn't been examined and followed through properly.
0.523800	I don't know exactly why I just get a little nervous when I go to the doctor or the dentist.  I am nervous and then I am relieved when I find out I am okay.  even if there's an issue, I am still relieved.  I think that just not knowing, and uncertainty about one's health is nerve-wracking.
0.190500	Mostly just when I have to get shots or have tihngs happen that might hurt in some way. Normal things are completely fine
0.500000	I'm usually nervous that they will find something severely wrong with me, like cancer. So I avoid going to the doctor as often as I can. I also tend to get jumbled thoughts and get extremely nervous and it's hard for me to articulate to them what I have going on or what I may need. It also doesn't help that when I do speak up, I get shot down and they just assume it's something that I don't need to be concerned about.
0.642900	I have generalized anxiety disorder and usually am always full of anxiety even if there is nothing wrong. What makes me the most anxious is the uncertainty of each visit. I Always expect the worst in every visit thinking something is seriously wrong with me. I cannot control this fear.  
0.714300	the feeling that given my age i might be diagnosed with a serious, life-threatening or costly condition. Or even worse, I condition for which I am referred to a specialist and they disagree in prognosis with the primary physician. 
0.428600	Getting weighed every single time makes me anxious. My white coat blood pressure makes me anxious... I tell the person who takes my blood pressure before the doctor comes in to wait a few minutes and ask me the standard questions and refer to my online chart BEFORE taking my blood pressure. But-they never listen to me, take it anyway and it comes out high. Then when the doctor comes in I tell him that told the assistant again to wait to take my bp(for the umpteenth time) and he takes it and it's fine.
0.642900	That they are going to find something alarming or that they are going to give me some piece of advice that will be difficult or unpleasant to take.
0.857100	I'm worried the doctor will tell me something bad. Being pregnant I'm worried the doctor will tell me something is wrong with the baby and I don't want that 
0.666700	That I will find out something negative or bad about my health. Not only would it be bad healthwise, but it would cost more money. And more medical bills is a nightmare in the US. 
0.619000	That i will get a bad diagnosis. That i may need to have an uncomfortable procedure performed. Or maybe the amount of money needed wont be enough 
0.381000	I worry maybe my blood work might come back with something wrong. Otherxious.than that I usually am not anxious.
0.833300	I often worry that they will discover something is wrong with me.  I also worry about how much the doctor's visit will cost and whether or not I will be able to afford by bill when I check out.  In general, visiting the doctor gives me high anxiety.
0.666700	If somethings bothering me, my biggest concern is that the doctor won't really give it too much attention and that they'll just brush it off and maybe give me a prescription that won't really help that much. I worry that i'll have to live with something that's bothering me just based off the fact that a doctor wants to get on with his  day without putting much thought into my problems. 
0.142900	I feel the most anxious when I'm at the doctor's office and have to have blood tests. I usually end up getting light headed and fainting. I am terrible with blood and the nurse must give me some smelling salts to get me back. It's terrible, i'm the most queazy person on earth and it is so embarrassing. I am trying to overcome my fears.
0.523800	Waiting for annual blood lab results to monitor specific conditions - if the doctor does not get back to me promptly with reassurance and feedback or interpretation, that makes me anxious. 
0.476200	Anytime you enter a doctor's office for an ailment it's always nerve wracking. You do not know what's wrong, and for me being in the medical field I always think of the worst conditions. It's almost like the people that google their symptoms and freak out. It's definitely harder waiting for test results knowing what's out there and how many people you file claims for that actually have these ailments. It makes you very uneasy. The anticipation is very unnerving.  
0.523800	I feel as if my doctor is going to tell me either something is terribly wrong with me or that i need some sort of risky procedure
0.404800	Even though I feel fine, there's always lingering doubt in my mind. Like I'll get some bad news or he'll tell me I have some disease or medical issue I wasn't anticipating.
1.000000	Like I said, I think I'm a kind of hypochondriac. It's very easy to convince myself I have any disease I hear of, and so I just want to avoid the whole situation, like going to the doctor will make it worse. Also, I've had really bad experiences with doctors mistreating my family members.
1.000000	I absolutely detest anyone touching me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach and sends my mind reeling even just sitting here thinking about it. I don't want any doctor disregarding or disrespecting my body autonomy. I would 100% avoid any circumstance where a doctor could even touch my arm.
0.404800	The only thing I get anxious about is when I have to get a flu shot or my blood drawn. I have needles and they freak me out otherwise I am fine.
0.976200	I'm most anxious about weighing myself. I have really bad body issues and haven't been able to lose pregnancy weight. 
0.142900	I sometimes dread getting bad test results or trying a new mediciation/treatment that might give me bad side effects. I also don't enjoy needles so that gives me anxiety. 
0.500000	The thing I find most worrisome is a doctor not being able to recognize the symptoms of what I may be going through
0.476200	I am most worried about going to the doctor when there is nothing really wrong.  I am most anxious to go to the doctor and be told that there is nothing wrong and it's all in my head.
0.714300	What worries me most when going to the doctor's office is not knowing what it is that they will be doing and what they will find.  I also find it somewhat unsettling to have a stranger looking me over and touching me. 
0.333300	Sometimes I encounter health professionals that blow of my symptoms so any worry is about getting them to investigate my symptoms instead of ignoring them.
0.500000	I don't like needles. I don't mind going to the doctor that much, but I know that if they are going to be drawing blood that it's going to make me uneasy. I also feel anxious about my own body weight and self conscious about it.
0.500000	I'm a person who has anxiety to begin with, so the uncertainty of what they might find makes me even more anxious.  It's also time spent away from the family, and that is something that makes me anxious as well.
0.571400	School and my future makes me feel worried about my future. There is a lot of pressure I have going on in my life and it can be a little too much at times.
0.690500	It is not comfortable being poked and prodded, so I always get anxious about that. And then I start thinking what if something shows up? There is a level they watch in my blood work and I worry it has fallen and I will have to go to a specialist. 
0.904800	I am nervous that they are going to find a major issue with my health. I am also nervous that they will miss something major with my health. 
0.738100	I just always feel like there might be something wrong that they are going to discover and that puts me on edge. 
0.761900	Well personally I don't like to be touched and I don't like to be spoken to in a demeaning way. I'm very bright, I'm in a Ph.D. program for pete's sake so it makes me worried that physicians think I'm stupid but aren't even nice about it and don't try to explain in  a way that would make sense to me or don't even take the time. Also the being touched thing is obviously a huge source of anxiety as well which stems more from my personal history. Like I'm 22 and I still haven't had a pap smear because I just can't do it. And I had an older male doctor as a kid who didn't explain what he was doing and was examining me and it was just a weird and difficult experience and it's hard to advocate for yourself with a doctor when they always think they know best. Sorry this answer is so long I hope it kind of made sense! Also bruh I don't understand health insurance for the life of me so that makes me worried too. I hate spending money so having to pay $25 for a copay when I feel like the doctor didn't even do anything makes me cranky and anxious about my budgeting. 
0.404800	Just being in a random cold room makes me nervous. I am also anxious about what it is i have that made me go to the doctor in the first place. I always worry it's going to be something huge.
0.142900	Doctors can be very pleasant to be around but many can also be untrustworthy.  It has been that way for all time and it wouldn't just suddenly halt one day.  Doctors can make sure that they are giving you a prescription that may not be the best for you as long as it is the best for them. 
0.642900	I just dont like talking about personal things with other people so it makes me anxious in general, not just because they are a doctor.
0.190500	Generally, I don't feel anxiety when I go to the doctor.  I take very good care of myself and I have good sense of when something is wrong.  It is only in those moments where I don't know what is behind a mystery ache or pain that I feel anxious.  
0.761900	I worry that I will be referred to yet another doctor who will then refer me to another doctor. I am also worried that I will be told that the only thing they can do is give me another pill to take. 
0.547600	The doctor makes me wait in the back room for hours. The room is often too warm and my health issues do not do well in extreme temperatures.
0.142900	I guess just knowing that I didn't hit the weight goal that I had for myself. I gained weight while I was pregnant and haven't completely lost all of that weight.
0.333300	Its entirelt possible that my health is such that the my doctor might find a problem that will be of major concern to me. Luckily I have never left the doctors office with such worries as my doctor has always been upfront with me about my health.
0.547600	I think the possibility of them finding something like a tumor or cancer.  Also I feel like they judge me for not being healthier or in better shape
0.142900	There really was nothing that made me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If anything, the only unpleasant part about visiting the doctor's office is the wait.
0.381000	I have had a lump removed from my breast and I have to have it checked to make sure it has not returned or any others have formed. I get anxious when I know it is time to have my check up.
0.547600	No one likes getting naked and wearing a flimsy paper robe and being poked around, and having the prospect of bad news.
0.142900	I don't think I ever feel anxious or worried. I think if I did, the only reason would be if my blood work panels came back normal. My doctor always treats me with respect and I never feel apprehensive or anxious to go to the doctor. 
0.428600	I have a chronic pain disorder, so when I see a new doctor I'm always anxious that they won't believe that my pain is real. 
0.523800	I was anxious and worried that they were going to tell me that I was going to need surgery for my tonsils a few years ago because I had constant sore throats.  My PCP was able to make a great decision with me about not having surgery because it would not have helped in the situation.

0.285700	Nothing really, He'll tell me the truth and not beat around the bush.  My philosophy is it is what it is, and we'll go from there.
0.714300	Well if I am in a doctorâs office that generally means that I am hurt or sick and I cannot take care of it on my own. So I am worried that the illness or injury is going to be worse that I feared. 
0.285700	How invasive things can be. That's what prevents me from going most of the time. I'd like to be able to discuss things with a doctor remotely (say, online) and then if a more invasive visit is needed we could arrange for a face-to-face.

Anxiety comes from being in the doctors office for a sickness that I want cured and having to rely on someone else to make the right choice as to what best cures that sickness. Sometimes I also get a little uneasy challenging the doctor.  For example, if I think one medication is better suited to my sickness, but the doctor is recommending something else. 
0.690500	Remember that doctors are there to help you and try to solve your health problems. It's not their purpose to hurt you as much as possible. On the contrary, they will try to achieve what needs to be done with as little pain as possible. Yet some things just hurt. No doctor can change that, unfortunately.

0.619000	"I use to feel very anxious when visiting the doctor as a child. I often had no idea what to expect and I often wondered what would happen if they couldn't figure out what was making me sick. Today the anxiety that I faced as a child has been greatly diminished. My current doctor and his office is really great about setting forth a game plan. Before any exam happens I'll be told what to expect so I'm not going into anything blind. Once the exam is over I'm given options on the course of treatments that are available. There is still some small part of me that gets worried before I'm seen because I roll through the ""what if they can't figure out what's wrong with me"" bit in my head. I've come to discover that this is unfounded which helps with future visits."

0.690500	Being 67 years old, I know that age brings about potential health issues.  Also being fairly healthy my whole life, the law of averages may rear its ugly head.  I know I do not always eat right and not exercise enough and I know the doctor will ask, I will be honest and he will prod me to do better.
0.714300	Just the thought that i should of come sooner. I blame myself for putting it of. Its always a bit nerve wracking getting examined  when you think something could be wrong with you.

0.619000	I am always fearful about a bad prognosis. I am also always working to avoid high blood pressure so consequently doctor visits tend to send my blood pressure up.
0.952400	I worry about what the doctor might find wrong with me. I worry whether the doctor will make a mistake or whether they will listen to my concerns. I get very anxious having to wait a long time for the doctor to examine me. In that period of time, all kinds of thoughts go through my mind. 
0.571400	I'm mostly uncomfortable having an unknown person examine my body.  This makes me anxious to be done with it as quickly as possible.
0.166700	My greatest concern when visiting the doctor's office is that I will be rushed and/or the doctor will not take my concerns seriously. I have a hearing loss and difficulty understanding individuals with strong accents. Therefore, this is also causes anxiety if I am meeting this doctor for the first time. 
0.333300	There is no benefit to worrying.  I completely agree and fully realize that most of my worries are ridiculous, but that does not make a difference; I still worry.  I've been trying to stop worrying my entire life.  It is uncontrollable. I have booked an appointment with my doctor, though I can already feel the anxiety building, and have been trying to distract myself.  I worry that he won't believe me, or something else.  It is embarrassing, and I feel bad about it.

0.690500	I have ha enough health issues in my life to get a sense of deja vu or flashbacks - I always have a feeling that something is about to pop up. And since I'm generally healthy, when I am at the doctor, it's usually for a pretty good reason.
0.428600	My family has a long history of heart trouble, in particular high blood pressure, so I am always anxious when I go in for a physical that now will be my time to start down the heart disease path.

0.619000	A combination of mild social anxiety and worrying that something will turn out to be not right with me, for example, my blood pressure being too high or something like that. I care a lot about my health, so having it examined is a high-stakes thing for me.

0.523800	If I have to get naked or show my crotch that makes me the most nervous.  If I have to get blood drawn that will also make me a bit nervous as I am not a big fan of needles.  My biggest hesitation when seeing a dr. is how much the treatment is going to cost.
0.595200	I am worried that I might find out that I have a serious and expensive disease like cancer.  If I had cancer it would complete change how I live my life.
0.190500	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I have prayed a lot before going to one. Going to get the results back from blood tests has made me feel a little uneasy, because I wondered what my primary care physician was going to tell me about the results, but I know that I am healed by the stripes of Jesus and I knew that I was going to be alright.  I think just waiting for the results and wondering what they are can cause a little bit of uneasiness. 
0.619000	I feel a little anxious when I go to the doctor because I know she is going to tell me that for my health I need to eat better and exercise.  I don't do those things and I know she will get on to me about it.
0.976200	I am worried about the doctor telling me I may have a disease or a condition with no cure.  I dont like people examining me.  I cant afford medical treatment.
0.833300	The fact that I might have something wrong with me but they will not notice it or even care to do a follow up on it. Also I can sense their lack of caring and that troubles me a lot as well.

0.142900	The only thing that would make me feel anxious or worried is if I had something that I did against the direction of my doctor. I would feel bad and not want to see my doctor.
0.166700	I feel that I have a pretty good bead on what is wrong with me medically.  I am never really expecting anything groundbreaking or life changing to happen or be told to me.  A doctors office visit for me is more of a chore then anything else.
0.285700	Nothing really anymore.  In the past it use to be getting on the scale, but now it does not bother me.
0.381000	In medicine, not everything is 100%, but very close. So naturally, when someone goes to their physician they are there for a particular reason, so I find it natural for one to feel anxious or worried because fear for the unknown. Iâm general, everyone needs to go see a doctor, for not only maintaining a healthy life, but preventing bad from occurring, and these types of feelings occur, along with excitement and pride when all comes out good. 
0.404800	My primary issue with having current Western medical practices applied to me is that medical schools do not address a wide enough spectrum of healing modalities. And if they do, they charge a lot for their services. Around here, MD/NDs charge far too much for me to afford. So, I'm left with the choice of visiting a doctor who is instructed in a more narrow treatment spectrum, which does not suit my approach to health. As a result, I'm worried and anxious, because I know how many doctors react if you question their advice.
0.666700	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor is the fact that I might have a medical condition that will cost a lot of money to cure or a long time.
0.166700	The thing I am most worried about is getting sick from other people while at the doctor's office.  I usually take herbal supplements and colloidal silver to overcome this issue.  The other thing I get worried about is the doctor not listening to what I have to say and then brushing me off as it's time to go the next patient.
0.809500	I am always anxious when it comes to an office setting. I feel like there could be anything wrong with anyone at any certain time and that is nerve wracking. I fear that I will hear the worst and have to go under surgery or something like that. 
0.428600	I do not often feel worried about visiting the physician. Sometimes, however, I would worry about a potentially serious diagnosis. I do not think this is uncommon, however, and it arises from a childhood fear I had of being diagnosed with a terminal disease like my uncle (cancer).
0.904800	Doctor's, Dentist's, They all make me anxious and worried. I'm not exactly sure WHAT MAKES me feel this way. Maybe the unknown? I just have a fear of doing things like this. Makes me very nervous!
1.000000	That the doctor may find a tumor or tell me that I have a major health illness. Even if I do not trust what the doctor is saying, this is enough to scare me and make me feel like I'm going to die! I think the entire situation of being in a dr office is intimidating. I am not sure if this is designed on purpose but the environment makes you extra anxious.  The whole waiting period amplifies this. 
0.309500	There's always the worry that they will randomly find something serious that you did not have. I feel that everyone has this worry.
0.238100	I am worried that they will find something serious that is wrong with me. I dont think its a very rational fear because I am in very good health but it is something that always lingers in the back of my mind while i am waiting in the waiting room at the doctor's office. I usually just want to get in, get treated, and get out as quickly as possible so that I can go back home.
0.285700	The possibility of having a health complication that will affect my day to day life. It would be very unpleasant to hear that I would have to take medication for the rest of my life for a health condition.
0.333300	I have not been with this doctor for an extended period f time. I need to spend a little more time underneath the care of this particular provider, in order to have complete faith in them.
0.714300	I am concerned that while conducting an examination he will find something seriously wrong with me. Usually I go right after getting blood work and I am always concerned that the findings will be very bad and it makes me extremely anxious
0.642900	I am most worried about the cost and pain of treatment. I also worry about how much time I might have to take off from work if something is seriously wrong. I have had a few medical treatments that cost thousands of dollars and had me out of work for a few days.
0.523800	I always have a tiny worry somewhere in the back of my mind that whatever small ailment is bothering me is actually a symptom of something huge and very serious, like a tumor or something
0.476200	i hate a new doctors visit and the nurse practitioner i saw was a different one then the on i saw a few years back at the same facility 
0.381000	Most of the time myself and many people visit doctor's offices is because there is something wrong, so being examined for the problem you've been having can make you slightly anxious or worried of the outcome of the examination. While it's great to potentially get answers for medical problems, you can get informed that what you're experiencing is worse than you expected. I believe that is typically in the back of the minds of most people in a doctor's care.
0.738100	I worry about getting blood drawn, about being declared somehow more unhealthy and having to have more work done, especially procedures or accompanying meds that I can't afford.
0.666700	My biggest fear is that I will receive news contrary to what I'm hoping for.  This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.
0.714300	I think the waiting process in doctor's offices make me the most nervous, or anxious. For example, waiting in the lobby for an appointment, or waiting for shots or a lab result. The feeling of not knowing what to expect, or what the staff is going to tell you can be nerve-wracking.
0.571400	When I get my blood pressure taken. I am getting older so hypertension is a real concern. I am trying to cut down on sodium intake and exercising more to keep myself health. But my job is somewhat stressful so my blood pressure goes up and down sometimes. Waiting to hear my result makes me feel uneasy.
0.619000	By the time I get to the doctor I've often thought of all the most terrible things my symptoms could be and though I know the worry is mostly unfounded, I am still anxious until I'm proven wrong.
0.238100	I absolutely hate that most doctors base your general health on the BMI index, when not everyone's shape is cookie cutter, or fits the categories. I get anxious when doctor's bring up my weight, because rather than argue with them about it, I just let them talk.
0.642900	 The thing that worries me the most is the bill I'll receive. Every passing minute I'm in that office, every procedure or drug prescribed is more money that I probably can't afford to pay even with insurance. I shouldn't have to focus on that but rather be focused on why I'm there in the first place. I seriously doubt I'm in the minority who think this way.
0.500000	I feel most worried when visiting a new doctor because I have to meet a new person and I don't know what to expect. 
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctors office. I know my doctor and his staff very well. We live in a very rural area and know each other well. My doctor has never made me feel uncomfortable of like I wasn't important. I've never had to wait a long time to be seen or treated poorly. 
0.476200	there is always the chance of the unknown no matter how healthy you feel or how well you think you are doing following your health Regine.
0.666700	I am usually concerned with having a high blood pressure. My father had White Coat syndrome, and I fear that I have inherited that from him. I do not like the sterile waiting rooms.
0.381000	The idea that a stranger is going to examine me and that he has the ability to diagnose me with illnesses or a clean bill of health.
0.571400	i don't feel anxious or worried at all if i am just having a visit or have only a small problem that is not serious.   if i had a serious problem, then i would be worried and maybe have a second opinion after their diagnosis of me
0.333300	I ususally do not feel anxious. I have a pretty go with the flow personality. There have been time I have recieved negative news from doctors but that's just part of life. 
0.547600	When I visit a doctor I feel the most anxious at the waiting. Waiting for the doctor to arrive and waiting to receive information about my condition. I wish the process was much quicker so I wouldn't have time to worry something awful might happen.
0.690500	I just have always been anxious when going to the doctor.  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even though I know it is for the best.  
0.190500	the only thing that makes me anxious if when I have to get any type of shot or have to have my blood drawn. I think this makes me feel anxious as I never look forward to having this done. 
0.666700	Visiting the doctor's office gets me focused on health issues I don't usually think about extensively but that just pass through my mind. It gets me thinking about what I might not be able to know about my health no matter how much I pay attention to my body and also that I might not be paying as much attention as I should.
0.381000	The most anxious part of a doctor's appointment is not knowing exactly what to expect.  As someone who is highly organized and detail oriented, I tend to get anxious when I find myself in an unfamiliar situation or surroundings and am not sure what to expect.
0.928600	I know that it will be very rushed, and that I will almost certainly not get all of my concerns addressed during the visit.
0.309500	What makes me most anxious is the unknown. It isn't the actual checkup, it's the potential that something could be wrong with me or that a symptom could be serious. I don't do well with uncertainty so I need straight answers instead of wait and watch or unknowns.
0.833300	I don't like to go to any doctor or hospital for any reason not even to visit someone else. I worry that they will find something bad so I do not like to go get a physical and I avoid the doctor's office as much as possible. They always have a pill for everything and I feel some prescription drugs take away the body's ability to heal itself. 
0.428600	I have a great doctor I just don't like going in general so that tends to make me feel anxious, but he's efficient and answers my questions and I usually leave wondering why I was so stressed out
0.142900	I worry that I may catch something from another patient like the flu while at the doctors office. If I'm having an unusual pain I worry that maybe something is really wrong and I'm about to find out what it is from my doctor.
0.261900	Not too much makes me irreparably anxious when visiting the doctor's office. I don't like parts of examinations like pap smears, but I know preventative care is important and my doctor has never made me feel needlessly uncomfortable. 
0.761900	I feel the waiting is the hardest part and I always don't know what to expect and will spend some time worrying if there is something more serious than I think going on. The longer I have to wait the more time I have to worry about things I probably shouldn't be worrying about in the first place.
0.809500	I fear they are going to find something terribly wrong with me. I fear that when they find something terribly wrong with me the treatment is going to be unpleasant. Even when I already know more or less what is wrong, I fear that the treatment is going to be unpleasant. I fear side effects of medication, and don't want to have to take more.
0.595200	Sometimes something will be wrong with me, and we will have to wait for lab results to help figure out what is going on.  This does scare me the most.  Also, when I had one issue, it wound up later being diagnosed as bladder cancer.  The symptoms were very scary, but she did help calm me down and had me come back every day to make sure the symptoms were getting better.  
0.785700	"I am most anxious when discussing symptoms and/or test results that do not conclusively provide a diagnosis. I have had a few experiences where my doctor at the time assumed that I was simply ""anxious"" and refused to take my concerns seriously. I was later diagnosed with a serious illness. It is my fear that I will be perceived as having a mental illness that causes my distress, or as ""drug-seeking""."
0.690500	Every time i go with some pain, i am thinking the worst case scenario. I dont like going to doctors office at all.
0.714300	I'm of course worried about receiving bad news.  And also of feeling like the experience itself wasn't very good.  I want to feel important and respected, and I rarely feel that way at the doctor's office.
0.381000	I'm not used to people poking me and prodding me. I also realize that I'm often being judged by my outside (since I don't wear makeup, will they assume I'm depressed?), that my outside figure doesn't reflect my habits (yes, I weight 175 lbs. And, yes, I go running multiple times a week. Both are true), and that some of my statements will be considered lies (people believe me when I say I don't smoke, they mostly believe me when they say I don't drink, but I'm pretty sure no one believes me when I tell them I'm a virgin). 
0.523800	What makes me anxious or worried is fear of the unknown.  What will she find?  Is there something wrong with me?  And what might the consequences be of any illness.  Basically, fear of the unknown.  I don't fear getting scolded for bad health behavior.
0.809500	The first thing that comes to mind is just having an appointment period. Time is precious to me and I am generally kept waiting much longer than my time. I understand this can be necessary but I don't appreciate it every time.  Next, the fear of getting a flu or cold just by visiting the office makes me very anxious. I do worry about how the visit  will go such as if I will get bad news or a lecture. I really dread the lectures. 
0.738100	I feel most anxious or worried when I have symptoms that might indicate a serious health condition. One of my doctor's nurses is a little unfriendly, so I feel anxious if she is the one who takes my vitals or draws my blood. Also, I feel worried about catching the flu from other patients at the doctor's office.
0.142900	I am most anxious about the cost of testing and treatment.  My copay is inexpensive, but some other areas of my insurance are not. 
0.261900	The idea that whatever is ailing me could be a terminal illness but those thoughts don't enter too often.
0.642900	I get anxious about what medical conditions that the doctor might discover and the treatments that might be suggested.
0.381000	When I was pregnant last year i went to see my doctor very often and I was always worried about being told there was something wrong with the baby. I didn't really care about me as much as i cared about my baby
0.690500	Finding out that is something seriously wrong with me is usually the top worry of mine. You could be feeling fine but there may be an underlying issue that you didn't even realize was present. The cost of going to the doctor is also something that I worry about since my insurance is not that good.
0.166700	I don't like appointments and I prefer to get them over with and move on with the rest of my day as quickly as possible.
1.000000	The fear of being told something could be seriously wrong with my health is the main thing that stresses me out. Another factor is, being a person who has struggled with eating disorders, being told the number on the scale, whether it is higher or lower than I expect, gives me so much anxiety. After hearing the number, I don't think about anything else and I usually revert to bad behavior. Anything that involves my weight puts me on edge - it's very triggering for me and, unfortunately, hearing information about it form a doctor is very important, so it is inevitable that I become nervous during a visit.
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office would be finding out if i have some sort of illness that may have gone undetected.
0.881000	I am just always afraid I am going to be told I have some sort of cancer or disease. I grew up with a Nana who was VERY OFTEN hospitalized and spent a lot of time there visiting her. She had a myriad of health conditions and I'm just afraid I'll end up like that no matter how much I watch what I eat and take care of myself.
0.642900	I always imagine and fear the worst. When I had my diabetes problems I was very concerned about my long term life and how it would affect my lifestyle.  
0.595200	Not knowing what he will find, and the cost of any treatment that might need to be done. My family has a history of health issues and I am afraid I might follow suit.
0.857100	Because they hold the key to knowledge i am unaware of so giving up control to random people is fearful and naked. Putting trust in a stranger for my well being is also not as controlling as I typically like and i know i am my own best fighter. The sickness that i am walking into at a doctors office is also seems like i will walk out worse than i walk in it seems counterintuitive to what im looking for.
0.547600	Sometimes I am afraid they will tell me that what I came to the doctor for is a symptom of a serious disease such as cancer.
0.309500	I just worry that something could be wrong even though I know there's little chance of that being the case.
0.357100	If I am sick, I am always anxious about what it could be and also I feel anxious that I may catch the flu or a stomach bug from someone who is there. This is something that makes me most anxious. 
0.857100	I am anxious that my blood pressure reading will be higher than normal, because I definitely have white coat syndrome. I am worried that my concerns won't be taken seriously. I am also concerned that the exam will be cursory because the physician is pressed for time and sees many people every hour. Something might be missed or overlooked.
0.309500	The most anxious or worried I can get when I go to the doctor is that  the doctor will say that is something wrong.  Or give me a hard time about weight or diet.
0.381000	I am afraid that I will embarrass myself, that they will discover something wrong with me that requires painful treatment or puts my life in danger, or that some aspect of the examination will be painful 
0.714300	I just worry that they're going to find something really bad, that I'm going to be sick with something deadly. 
0.595200	I have a hard time comprehending people talking at me. I can't focus no matter how hard I try. I usually try remember key words and look up stuff later. They just get so rushed I don't want to be rude and keep interrupting. So I feel useless sometimes. And passed off that after 35 years of the pain no has an explanation.
0.452400	The unknown is the biggest source of worry or anxiety that I have whenever I have to visit the doctor's office.
0.190500	I always dislike going for my physical because of the thorough examination given,  and then having to have blood drawn.
0.738100	I have generalized anxiety disorder so doctors appts for me while necessary tend to bring stress and anxiety. I become anxious about what my weight will be, what my blood pressure will be (most likely high due to the anxiety) etc. I just tend to be a very anxious person even when there is nothing to really worry about. 
0.833300	When I am visiting the doctor's office,the things that make me feel most anxious or worried is first of all, not knowing what the actual problem is and worrying if my ailment is something that could be quite serious. I also become anxious and worried,wondering if I would be referred for additional testing,or perhaps to specialists for my ailment. Lastly, I get worried and anxious about the cost of my medical care. I am limited as to what I can afford to pay for my health care.
0.642900	I have just always been uncomfortable about letting someone  look me over.  I know that it is sometimes necessary, but it kind of feels like an invasion.  That's just how I feel.
0.690500	Not knowing if something is wrong with me or that something is wrong with me. Fear of receiving needles. 
0.690500	I suppose I sometimes think about the potentially worst case scenario for a given situation, and that may lead to some anxiety. Even if hypothetical, some visits may reveal an unexpected diagnosis, but on the other end of the spectrum everything may be fine. I suppose this is a situation that falls under the whole idea of hope for the best but expect the worst.
0.452400	I feel anxious that I will find out there something is wrong with me that I was unaware about.  The sterile atmosphere in general also makes me feel a bit anxious.
0.285700	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at all when I go to the doctor suprisingly I have always had good checkups and no major health issues. 
0.309500	Getting bad news,  or being misdiagnosed. The Doctor not taking your complaints seriously. Trying to remember what you need to say in the little time you get to be face to face with the doctor.
0.857100	The comments the doctor will make about my body or lifestyle. The needle for the blood test and the results.
0.142900	When I visit the doctor's office, I have no reason to feel anxious or worried. I have been in good health my whole life and have had almost no health issues. However, if I were to feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, it may be due to the fact that I had no clue about what may be causing my symptoms.
0.500000	Usually the thought of what might be wrong. Sometimes my mind wanders to the worst medical conditions.
0.238100	I feel anxious because I don't like discussing my problems and having to answer questions. I also don't like not knowing what's wrong with me and dreading the worst.
0.809500	That the doctor will tell me that I have a life threatening decease like cancer. I also don't like waiting and the doctor being late.
0.619000	I get nervous at times because you never know what could happen. You never know what conditions may exist that you don't know about.
0.571400	The only time I get anxious as the doctor is when I am getting a shot or having some kind of test done.
0.523800	I go to the doctor when I am sick. I have never been for a wellness check or a physical. So I am already in at least some discomfort. I just want the problem to go away. Being sick in a place with other sick people is not comforting at all. I just want an answer. I know that the course of drugs will take a week or longer to really start working. So it all takes so long.
0.833300	I feel uneasy if i am visiting a doctor and do not know what the test results will conclude. Also, I feel more uneasy to be examined by doctors when they perform more invasive testing (prodding/poking). If it's just a routine checkup, then i usually feel much easier/relaxed about it. 
0.738100	"Discovering something unknown. Or something that I could have prevented but did not. I just have general ""white coat hypertension"""
0.666700	I have white coat syndrome so it happens without a lot of reasons. Sometimes, I fear that they will find something wrong or that I will have something wrong that they won't catch. Cost used to be an issue but I have great insurance now. 
0.476200	I am usually not that nervous or anxious when visiting any doctor but, am not that excited or comfortable either. I dont have any particular feelings it's just neccesary.
0.595200	i've had high blood pressure and chest pains. i've had pretty serious kidney stones. when i go to the doctor because of some pain, at my age i always worry whether it might be heart disease or cancer. haven't had anything that serious yet, thankfully.
0.571400	It's always nerve wrecking when I visit a doctor's office because I don't know if there is something wrong with me. Most of it is the wait after you are examined and waiting for the results to come to me.
0.500000	I went to the emergency room several months ago because my feet were swollen for a few weeks and it was painful for me to walk or stand. In addition to the pain and swelling there was a very aggressive rash on both feet. After sitting in the ER for hours, the doctor told me I had athlete's foot. I followed his instructions and took the medications and one weeks later the condition only got worse. I went to my physician and was then told the problem was an extension of my eczema and that he would put in a referral for me  to see a dermatologist. After a few reminders and months later, I am still waiting to see a dermatologist.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious when visiting the doctor. Sometimes there's a weird feedback loop when taking blood pressure where I'm almost nervous that if I'm feeling nervous about my blood pressure being high I'll get an inaccurately high reading, which makes me a little nervous. It's pretty dumb and the nurse and I laugh about it.
0.809500	I don't always know what the doctor is going to tell me when I am there for a visit. There is no way of telling and they can sometimes be very blunt when telling you things that can really upset you. Once again, it goes back to their insane workload and the fact that they don't really have the time to form a genuine rapport with their patients.
0.285700	I never feel worried about going to the doctors. I am going there to be healed so not anxious at all. Maybe a little worried about the price but not seeing them
0.500000	Wondering if something is much worse than I think it is is probably the biggest thing for me to make me super anxious. I dont like that because who knows what the problem is.
0.857100	The things that make me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is I usually already know that it is going to be something bad, and I fear what I will be told and than the next course of action. I have many medical issues and most don't simply just go away on there own.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is think if I'm going to feel any pain or any discomfort.
0.857100	I have intense anxiety anyway just normally anyway. Doctors certainly make it worse. A lot of it is simply discomfort around the stranger. Another part is the vulnerability. 
0.666700	I think I always worry that I will have something unexpected wrong with me. There is such a bombardment of cancer awareness that it almost feels inevitable that we will all get it eventually.
0.190500	I am comfortable at the doctors office now that I have a doctor that I am confident in. Having a Dr who wont listen to me or who dismisses my symptomology is what makes me most uncomfortable at the dr
0.452400	I think it is just the unexpected. I'm ok as long as I know what is going to happen, but if I don't .. then I get anxious - confused - nervous and sometimes upset.
0.142900	I trust the doctors and I already know that they advise for the sake of every patient, and they never ought to harm intentionally anyone
0.238100	I worry about the cost of things sometimes and if things will be more expensive than what i am expecting
0.428600	I don't too much get anxious or worried during a doctor visit. I am normally completely at ease. I trust my provider so I;m sure that helps ease any worry or anxiety
0.309500	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.  I don't usually have a reason to be.  I know what to expect with my doctors.  They are straight forward and honest with me.  They will go over all of my options with me and discuss pros and cons of all of those options to help me to make an informed decision so there usually isn't a reason to be worried.
0.428600	I worry a lot about the cost. Medical care is so expensive, even with insurance, and there's no way to know how much things cost until the EOB arrives.
0.404800	I'm always there about something that is out of my control, and I have to trust that the person I'm seeing might be able to help with the situation.  I usually wait until problems build up, so there is also that urgency.
0.357100	Being examined is an anxiety-inducing experience. There's a lot of uncertainty about what the results could be. Going to see a doctor is also anxiety-inducing in itself.
0.928600	Being told that I'm a liar, or getting fat shamed. Being blamed for most of my issues. Getting treated like an idiot. I'm really sick of it but it happens every time.
0.238100	I am most anxious that my blood pressure will be high, or they'll find something I wasn't aware of having.
0.428600	Most of the time when I visit the doctor for anything other than routine physicals, I don't always feel I know how my treatment will go. It seems sometimes I have left the doctor's office being no closer to healed than I was when I entered.
0.142900	What causes me anxiety at a doctor's office?  A request for a blood sample, or the need to have an IV.  I really do not care for needles or for blood draws.  Not sure exactly why, but both are something that I would prefer to avoid.
0.619000	I am overweight and I know the doctor will ridicule me about it. It is also always uncomfortable to have an exam or get blood drawn. It is not something I look forward to.
0.642900	Usually the thing that makes me most anxious is having to sit in a waiting room surrounded by sick people who are coughing and sneezing and being afraid I will catch something from them.
0.666700	You never know what they may find.  I always fear the cost of follow up appointments and the potential time that will be wasted.  Definitely not convenient.
0.761900	The idea of receiving bad news is what makes me the most anxious and uneasy when going to the doctor's office. I hate the feeling even though I know it is necessary for me to get a physical examination.
0.738100	Even though I trust my doctor (and any of the specialists I see), I always get anxious about doctors appointments because there is always an element of unknown. There is always a chance they could discover something is wrong with you that is totally random and unrelated to what you came in for, and it could change your life. 
0.666700	I feel anxious when waiting for test results. The uncertainty of not knowing what is going on with my body makes me worried. I also dread having examinations where the doctor must physically touch my body.
0.261900	I am afraid that they are going to assume my condition and put me on a regimen without really trying to work on finding the issue.  I do not feel that doctors really look into things correctly. 
0.785700	If I'm going in for a check-up i would fear finding out something bad (i.e. diabetes, cancer). I also worry if they may have found something or if my physical condition is more serious that what i personally think. 
0.547600	I just feel anxious having like ten minutes to get my questions/concerns answered. And I don't have a good relationship with any of the doctor's I've had. 
0.714300	I'm afraid that my doctor is going to mess with my medications because they try that every few years.  I am concerned I am going to walk out with referrals to a bunch more doctors and/or more unnecessary testing.  
0.666700	I feel anxious or worried in case something is seriously wrong. Although it is not better to be blind to an issue when it is time to visit a doctor, the fear of the unknown leads to more worry than just putting it off. 
0.857100	Why not feel anxious?  I might have some sort of disease and I don't like anyone touching me period.  I hate going to the hospital it's a depressing place to be.
0.785700	I am always scared they will tell me I am overweight first off. Then just the initial exam I am afraid that I will have some sort of disease that is really bad because I am terrified of death.
0.142900	I don't like waiting in the waiting room. But I especially hate waiting in the examining room where it is so cold and there's nothing to do while you wait. Plus the visits are too short to delve into any problems you may have. The doctors are always in a big hurry to see as many patients as they can so you feel like you're not anything special. I wouldn't care if the doctor just pretended to be interested in my problems as long as he/she showed any interest at all.
0.619000	My main concern is to find out that I have some really serious disease. However it is always better to know and start looking for the treatment or the setup a plan than not being aware and realizing it too late. The other thing that is very upsetting is the costs of the treatments. It is always expensive to go to the doctor and getting the necessary examinations. I do not understand how people are able to afford medical treatments. It is way to overpriced and after that you will live and work to pay back the costs of your medical treatment.
0.904800	I'm afraid i'm going to get a bad diagnosis. The anxiety and dread of not knowing the condition i'm in is the worst. Also i'm worried about what type of mood my doctor is in, or how experienced and thorough the nurse is. 
0.404800	Sometimes I worry about cancer or some other condition.  I am aware of a bunch of people I either know well or that are in my work/social circle that have had gall bladder problems.  I worry about that.  
0.333300	When visiting a doctor I am worried that they may find out something that is wrong with me that I never thought of or had concerns over. The other things that makes me feel anxious is have a female exam. Even with a female physician this makes me feel anxious.
0.690500	I think it has to do with the waiting and all the thoughts and ideas that enter my mind. The longer i am waiting the more harder it is to stay calm. Feeling anxious and wanting to get it over with.
0.714300	Not knowing what new problem may have been discovered from recent lab work. I'm always a little anxious about what my blood pressure reading will be.
0.666700	I am most worried that I will be very sick because of an unwise activity I've engaged in or it will in some way be my fault. I do not want the doctor to judge me based on that. 
0.309500	I fear having something really serious be discovered about my symptoms. For example, a few years ago I had frequent migraines and my doctor suggested that I get further testing down just to stay on the safe side. I was afraid there was a tumor. 
0.619000	I'm afraid she will find something serious and then I will have to make decisions on what to do. I prefer not to think about such things.
0.357100	I think it's the atmosphere of doctors offices/hospitals that make me anxious. It always seems to be associated with health problems and that makes me feel that I have problems.
0.500000	That would be getting bad news that I have a terminal illness or issue. Also just the rooms and materials in the office make me very anxious.
0.190500	Getting bad information that may cost me a lot of money or affect my life in the future. Having to go on a medication or something that may hinder my lifestyle in any way. 
0.476200	It's nothing in particular, usually. It's just a general concern that something could always be wrong that I'm not aware of. A doctor's office isn't usually a place you visit when things are going splendidly. 
0.928600	I have always been afraid of going to the doctor.  I am very fearful of pain and doctor's visits always has been related to pain in my mind. I think  I have phobia maybe.
0.547600	I don't like having people i don't know well touching me. I also have a small fear that the visit will result in the knowledge that I have a large medical problem.
0.142900	I don't have much fear or worry when I go to the doctor. I used to, before I started trusting Jesus. Now that I do trust Jesus, I give all my worries and concerns to him. I just go to the doctor for checkups, and I deal with whatever is said the best way I can.
0.714300	I am old enough to know the probability for health and longevity, and also old enough to have experienced times when things did not work out the way we hope that they would. What makes me feel anxious is that the older I get the more likely I will be told that I am going to die by a doctor based merely on probabilities.
0.738100	I am afraid that they will find something wrong with me that will be difficult to treat such as cancer, or that they won't look into my health needs as much as I'd like them too
0.523800	I don't like waiting for the doctor. I feel uncomfortable. I can also feel anxious about finding what is wrong with me
0.642900	When I have been examined my overall health condition, especially I have been screened for cancer, I felt most anxious and worried whether I had some symptom of cancer or uncured disease.     
0.619000	"Mostly I worry about how the doctor will perceive me and whther they judge my bad habits. I sometimes worry about getting bad news about my health but I think that is normal, and it will only increase as I get older. I worry that they will rush the appointment and not answer all of my questions as well. I have to check the time they come in for billing purposes because they will bill me for ""expanded visit"" which is supposed to be like 20 minutes but they stay for only 7-10 mins. This is unfair and I do worry about it."
0.285700	There's a variety of mild anxiety. For example, maybe there's nothing much wrong with me, and it was stupid to go to the doctor. Maybe there's something really wrong. Things like that.
0.690500	Whenever I visit a doctors office I feel most nervous that the doctor is going to tell me to do something which will not help my condition or better understand my condition but instead just prescribe whatever is most fashionable or lucrative for himself. I am concerned that my best interest will not be taken into consideration. I am concerned about harmful and poorly understood medications being prescribed to me. 
0.333300	I'm mostly anxious about getting my blood drawn or shots. Sometimes I am anxious when the waiting area is very crowded, because I'm not sure when I will be seen and hope not to be rushed. Occasionally if I have a lot of concerns I'm worried I'll forget to ask everything on my mind.
0.523800	Just the thought of going to the doctor always has made me nervous and a fear of needles and such. Once I am in and see the doctor I am fine. 
0.381000	I have to be weighed and I never lose weight.  I have to let the doctor feel me in places I would rather not have anyone touch.  I have to reveal myself to an almost complete stranger.
0.523800	Waiting for them to examine me and tell me something is wrong with me.  While waiting, my mind jumps to crazy conclusions like I am dying of some disease or I have tumors growing somewhere.  These thoughts kind of make my heart rate go up and he ends up thinking i have high blood pressure.
0.571400	Usually it's just dealing with the doctor and potentially telling them that they're wrong if they were to simply give me medicine with a thousand sides effects that hide the real problem one might have. 
0.309500	I'm a little anxious about procedures that are done to me, I don't like anticipating the discomfort with some procedures.
0.285700	I'm not really usually very worried when visiting a doctor's office.  However there is always the back of the mind fear that they may discover or see something that is not what I came in for. Additionally, when I have blood tests I sometimes fear that they may discover something that is wrong that could be caused by cancer or some other major illness.
0.428600	I am always worried that I will not get a good bill of health.  I have some weight to lose and know that I might be confronted about that and what I should be doing.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I take any of the bad news to come with stride and try and have a positive outlook whenever I visit the doctors office. I do not fear checkups or any examinations.
0.690500	Mainly worried they will be giving me bad news. A lot of bad diseases, cancer, heart conditions, etc, are in my family. 
0.357100	I can't explain it.  I just don't particularly enjoy then environment and I have a low level uncomfortable feeling about it all.
0.285700	Well, this doesn't really apply; see, I go to the doctor when something is bothering me or once a year for my checkup. The doctor is there to help me, is my attitude, so even if I'm worried about some condition, I don't fear going and doN't feel very anxious or worried.
0.833300	I get scared because I worry about what might be wrong. I get all worked up about it. I'm worried about having to take a new medication or if there might be something seriously wrong with me. It really freaks me out.
0.714300	When you visit a doctor's office, it's usually because something is wrong, unless it is for preventative purposes. The anxiety and worry are related to the uncertainty of your condition and the uncertainty of whether it can be treated, or what kind of treatments are available. There is anxiety and worry when visiting a doctor's office because the doctor might not be able to help you, they may not give a lot of time for your visit and rush to see another patient when you still feel unsure about how to proceed. The doctor might not have confidence in treating you and that is also scary.
0.142900	The most frustrating occurrence is the never-ending rotation of doctors.  It seems every year, (interns) I have to go through my entire history again.  Including, family, life, medical, etc.  Then, a new diagnosis, new medications, and so on, and so on.
0.642900	I feel anxious or worried that the doctor might find something wrong with me.  Anxious because I might feel pain during the exam or the test given to me.
0.357100	Whenever i feel anxious seeing my doctor its generally due to me not knowing how much information or what information specifically i should release to her even though im fully aware i should tell her everything due to HIPA and the confidnetiality it provides. I still have anxiety however with certain things like mental state etc. 
0.523800	While logically I know that there's likely nothing wrong with me, the last visit I had involved being diagnosed with PTSD. It was a bit of a soul-crusher to have had that confirmed, because I sort of knew that I did for the month leading up to the visit.
0.214300	That what I think is no big deal will turn out to be something a lot more serious. I also get anxious if I have to get a shot as I am not a fan of needles. I also get a little anxious being exposed to sick people.
0.833300	I never know what they will find wrong with me.  Or if they will find a cyst and want to do more tests that cost more money. 
0.642900	I feel anxious that they are going to find something and give me bad news. No one wants bad news in their life. I know I could make better judgement as far as health goes and I am always worried that what I am doing is not enough. Especially when I was pregnant I was always afraid something would go wrong. 
0.714300	Generally what makes me feel most anxious is when I know I have something wrong but I can not match an illness to the symptoms. 
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's. I have enough experience with doctors that I am comfortable that I can ask for and get what I need.
0.238100	I worry when there is a waiting time before diagnosis. I have had 3 or 4 good scares in my life, liver failure and cancer. I am not the kind of person that will freak out on possibly fatal news like that.  The other thing was needles. I used to become quite anxious when waiting. 
0.881000	I often feel like they will rush me and not listen to what I have to say or that they will write me off as a hypochondriac.
0.404800	I am not too anxious when going to my doctor, that is, about the physical exam. I do have social anxiety, so for the most part I am nervous around all people and social situations. So sometimes talking one on one and being physically examined makes me anxious, but it's not the doctor's fault.
0.761900	When I go for my yearly exam and it involves female stuff I hate it. It is uncomfortable for the patient and for the Doctor. Plus it is somewhat painful. Then there is the breast exam. I don't like anyone seeing me undressed much less touching me in a private area. I am always so relieved when it is over and I am walking out all dressed!
0.142900	i would say the wait to see if you are ok like your blood work your blood pressure your ox your heart your weight
0.142900	If I believe beforehand that there is something seriously wrong with me BEFORE I talk to the doctor, then I might feel anxious as I wait to see him and talk to him. But that is rare. I  do not usually feel anxious while I am talking to the doctor. I usually just let him examine me and listen closely  to what he tells me. But I do not tend to overreact to things. If he , on the other hand, told me Ihave some deadly disease that cannot be treated, obviously I would feel rather anxious.
0.285700	I donât feel nothing at all so I donât know how to answer this question... will get through whatever the outcome is 
0.547600	It depends on what has been going on with me lately. I know when I haven't been trying to take care of myself in terms of diet and exercise and fear what the doctor will say about the results of some of those little examinations. If I also have some kind of sickness I've never dealt with before, I can start to feel fairly anxious. 
0.452400	I feel anxious about the probable poking and prodding that will take place, and the inevitable disdain that the doctor will evoke once I start making suggestions that might contradict something they had stated. I also worry about the possible copay. 
0.381000	I'm afraid that they aren't going to really listen to what I have to say.  I am afraid that they will give me a generic answer to my problems instead of asking me more questions just to make sure it isn't a more serious problem.
0.523800	If i'm going to have a procedure done or a surgery i'm obviously going to be nervous and worried. That's always how it works for me. When going in for a routine exam i'm not usually worried, however.
0.666700	I tend to be a very anxious person.  When I go to the doctor's office, I tend to assume the worst for my health or that I have something wrong with me when it tends not to be true. 
0.714300	It is the fear of being judged and of not knowing if they will find anything wrong with me. Perhaps they will judge my lifestyle, or perhaps they will say I am eating all the wrong things or not exercising enough.
0.666700	I have social anxiety, everyone makes me anxious. But being in a place that knows you are having difficulties makes it worse. Nurses, PA's, Doc's all rushing around coming in and going out.
0.238100	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting a doctor is a general anxiety of being in public places in general, along with the likelihood of being undressed. Also, I usually only visit a doctor is there is a problem, so there is some anxiety as to what the problem may be.
0.881000	My biggest fear is that of being told that I have an incurable disease or only have a few months to live.  I think my fear is that my mother died when I was young and my father was very sick as I was growing up.
0.547600	I worry I will be scolded for having poor self-care. I worry that they will find out I am actually quite sick. Also, I am generally nervous around many people who are authorities and I have a strong desire to look as though I know a lot, but I don't actually know much about the medical field.
0.309500	Always makes me nervous to see a doctor, although my health is quite good.  Probably left over from child hood when I would have to go because of something stupid I did.
1.000000	"Even though I have a ""good"" insurance plan, I am in constant fear that something unaffordable will happen at the doctor's office. If the doctor decides to send me to a lab, imaging center, or hospital, it might be out of network or there might be some other loophole that will give my insurance company an excuse not to pay. A prescription might be on some arbitrary list causing my insurance to deny it. Even the doctors fees might be mishandled by the insurance company. There is no way to comparison shop or get an estimate of fees beforehand. As a patient I am at the mercy of a healthcare system rapaciously seeking to squeeze every possible dollar of profit out of me."
0.285700	I am just generally anxious about what he will find or that he will discover I have been doing something wrong. I am not worried about his actions or thoughts but, my own and chance happenings.
0.809500	I am always worried about my weight and if the doctor is going to say something about it. I don't like talking about my weight. 
0.428600	What makes me the most worried when i visit the doctor's office is the possibility of having negative results. Knowing that i take care of myself and am in good health, i should not as much but still. Things manifest in healthy people all the time.
0.642900	What makes me most anxious or worried is that they will find something unexpected or recommend an invasive procedure.
0.690500	I am usually a little worried that they will find something wrong. Especially since so many of my recent visits have been prenatal - I always worry about the health of the baby. 
0.285700	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am most worried when I discover a reason for which I will need to see a doctor
0.238100	Waiting. Once I am back in the exam room I'm usually ok. The only other thing was expressing how bad I felt knowing it was something other than the flu or general fatigue and worry about not being able to express it because I am such a strong person that doesn't show weakness so its hard for me to really break down and let people know I feel horrible.
0.523800	Depending what the visit is for would determine how anxious or worried I would be. I think what makes me most worried would be being concerned the doctor would find something I was unaware of, or something potentially serious. This worries me sometimes.
0.381000	It's the uncertainty of it all that's nerve-wracking. You second-guess yourself and maybe something is wrong and maybe you lose sight of the truth and start to fear random things.
0.404800	I have an eating disorder, and if a doctor or nurse is new to me, I sometimes worry I'll get unwanted and unhelpful advice about diet and exercise. I don't like looking at the scale, either, for related reasons. 
0.642900	i always feel like i'm going in for a test I didn't study for. I usually have a list of questions i want to ask and in my nervousness i forget them all. 
0.619000	I'm 55 and haven't had a medical issue in decades. While I do exercise regularly and eat well; I've smoked for 20 years and drink regularly so if I had an issue I'd be concerned as I'm far from a person who you'd consider has a healthy life-style.
0.714300	I am afraid after certain tests are run, I may be diagnosed with some incurable dread disease. I would feel helpless and very upset to receive this news.

0.619000	When I'm going in for something and I'm not sure what is wrong with me, there is always uncertainty there with not knowing what could potentially be wrong with me. 
0.476200	Some doctors do not value patients' time. They never see patients at the time of the appointment and they do not offer anything to read.
0.142900	I don't usually feel upset or worried when visiting my doctor's office.  The last time I had blood work done I was a little nervous to get the results of the tests back, but they made me feel at ease and told me ways to improve my numbers and things I could do to better my health overall. 
0.571400	I feel the most anxious when I have symptoms that I haven't been able to cure on my own and that's what's bringing me to the doctor's office in the first place. 
0.500000	I can feel anxious regarding when I have to wait for a test result as if its something that could mean there could be adverse results for long term.
0.333300	Just the atmosphere in general. I have no real issues or reasons to feel anxiety. It's probably more from childhood feelings or the idea of a hospital.
0.809500	I hate visiting the doctors office because 1) I hate getting on the scale. 2) I hate getting shots or my fingers pricked. 3) The nurses are usually rude. 4) My doctor does not know much about me. I feel like he knows my name but does not care about me or does not care much about my health. 5) My doctor has not helped me get the right type of anxiety medicine that I have been wanting. All of it makes me tired and I just need something that calms me down.
0.214300	I feel anxious about any examination in general. Being checked out physically can be a little stressful for me. I don't like being poked and prodded. 
0.452400	There are a few things that could make you feel anxious when visiting a doctor's office.  A couple things that make me anxious or worried is how much the copay is going to be and if I paid my  Deductible yet or in my going to get charged a ton of money.  The next thing I worry about is sitting in the waiting room with all the sick people.   Another thing that makes me anxious on the way to The Doctor's office is how long the wait is going to be in the waiting room.  Also if your blood pressure is going to be high when you 1st get there because all the waiting.
0.452400	What makes me feel anxious is not knowing rather I did good of bad when it comes time to check my diabetes and what the results will show.  I dont follow what i am supposed to be doing on a regular basis so everytime i usually get anxious about it and what my doctor will think. Also when going to the doctor sick people are in there and i dont want to catch what they have like strep, cold or even worse this years Flu. 
0.833300	I feel anxious and worried when i will have to visit Doctor as I am afraid if any other deseases may come to my notice apart from the one for which i wished to consult doctor and also if the doctor confirms my ailment as the one which cant be treated or there is no treatment that leads to frighten me.
0.261900	The fact that they can get very intimate into my personal life, both physically and emotionally.  They also can sometimes be slightly vague with what their thinking is on my health.
0.333300	I'm always worried about finding out that something is wrong with me that I didn't know. There's always a fear that I may go to the doctor for something routine and find out something catostrophic
0.261900	I hate getting on the scale. I never want to know how much I weigh, and I always tell the nurse not to tell me. That's probably not a great idea. My blood pressure is almost always good, but I get nervous that perhaps on a particular visit, it will be high. 
0.142900	nothing because I trust that my life is in good hands with my doctor so there is no use trying to worry myself and have worse nerves than i need for nothing
0.738100	"My doctor is a part of the LDS Church, and I am too, but not ""active."" He is a high council member in the Church and has pressured me and tells me I need to go to my Ward (or church). I can't make this stuff up. I felt it stepped over the line or patient/physician relationship. It make me really anxious to go to another appt with him because I knew he would know I haven't been to church, or paid tithing, etc."
0.833300	I feel the most anxious about feeling judged or criticized by the doctor. I'm afraid of them blaming me for my conditions or just not listening or taking me seriously. I'm afraid of feeling lectured to, disrespected, dismissed and invalidated by them. 
0.285700	Anything involving needles. I have a HUGE needle phobia that has oftentimes prevented me from getting typical blood work or vaccines.
0.642900	I feel anxious or worried when I feel I haven't followed the doctor's instructions properly or have been lax regarded my own health. When I am disappointed in myself, I am anxious in anticipation of telling the doctor the problem, because I don't want him to be disappointed in me.
0.595200	I do not enjoy waiting to be seen and all the little things that must be done (weight, temperature, blood pressure). 
0.976200	Something about the look of doctor's offices, I also don't like them to touch me. I am afraid of pain. I was upset and scared last time I was in the hospital. 
0.285700	I am usually nervous and anxious during my doctor's appointment. My blood pressure is almost always higher when it is being measured by the nurse. I guess I want to unconsciously be as healthy as possible and can sense judgement of some sort - or maybe it is all in my head.
0.404800	Usually it has to do with seeing how much weight I have gained. Other than that, my anxiousness could only be due to the unknown. But I have full trust in my PCP. 
0.738100	The lack of compassion. Most doctors don't care about the patient. They just want to push drugs on you and get you out of the door instead of reviewing your background and the things you have tried that was either successful or failed. We have records for a reason and no one seems to read them. I hate having to start from scratch with each doctor I see. 
0.571400	Getting injections of any kind. As well as x-rays and cat-scans. talking about cancers of any kind. i dont like how many germs and other possible parasites are  around the inside of docters office.
0.690500	Worried that they will find something wrong that would require expensive treatments or hinder my standard of living that would put a burden on my family and friends
0.142900	I do not worry when I go to the doctor's.  I know it is necessary for my health.  I have confidence that my doctor will listen to my complaints and proscribe the necessary and correct treatments.
0.500000	Uncertainty about potentially bad things.  Moles that could be cancer, things of that nature.  When I don't understand or know what is going on with my own body, that brings anxiety.
0.285700	It depends what i am going in for. i think that if i am already unsure about something regarding my health, the unease will already be there.
0.642900	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the initial greeting and how the conversation starts off because lately I haven't been taking the best care of myself, so I'm always really nervous to find out how much worse things have gotten with either my weight or cholesterol numbers.
0.738100	I get most anxious because I don't know what the outcome of the appointment will be. I also don't know how the doctor will treat me while I am there.
0.142900	I am currently diagnosed with a chronic condition.  The thing that makes me the most anxious or worried is finding out that my health has gotten worse rather than stayed stable.
0.404800	I've come from a history of cancer in my mothers side of my family. I would feel worried of anxious if they would diagnosis with something in that range. I have small children so I feel that I have to be here to guide them in to their adulthood.
0.333300	I ALWAYS FEEL A LITTLE ANXIOUS AND WORRIED BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT HE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG.
0.666700	I dont like going to the doctor if I can avoid it. It makes me think maybe something is wrong. I would rather be finished and find out what is the diagnosis
0.452400	I have had poor past experiences with doctors that automatically makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, even though I trust my current doctor. Just being in a doctor's office setting seems to trigger the anxiety.
0.738100	My genetics/family health history is not great so I'm always a bit worried something's going to hit me out of nowhere as I get older.
1.000000	I often worry that they will find something seriously wrong with me or that I am going to die.  Even though I feel ok, I always dread that they might find something that canât be cured or they canât help to heal.
0.476200	I just always wonder if I'm in worse shape than most others seen by the doctors.  It makes me evaluate the uncomfortable aspects of my health and my body.
0.357100	It is simply that factor of uncertainty. Even if you feel healthy you can never truly know if there is something wrong that can't be seen or felt. You always want to hear that you are healthy but you can't know if they are going to find something unusual.
0.214300	I sometimes just feel generally anxious when I visit the doctor's office - I feel that I suffer from 'white coat phenomena'. I sometimes notice that my blood pressure is elevated for no particular reason when I visit the doctor's office.
0.357100	When i go to the doctors office my main worry is whether or not im going to be getting a shot. I do not like needles and really hate getting a shot or giving blood. 
0.190500	Honestly the cost thereâs not much else other than that like I feel like going to a doctor making sure Iâm OK doing my research hoping they do their research but if they make mistakes that cost more money that is what frustrates the worries 
0.714300	sitting in a waiting room full of potential sick people. that he might charge me a unreasonably high amount etc,
0.571400	I know that he is going to complain about my weight.  Then he is going to tell me that his wife put him on a diet and how small his plate is.  He will then tell me that his wife is blond and beautiful and that she knows what is best.  Then he will talk about his need to still lose ten pounds so that his wife will be proud of him.....every time I go see him.....same story.....
0.642900	I come from a family with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, and I'm always anxious when I go to the doctor that they'll find out I have one of these things.
1.000000	Once I am waiting over 20min I start to panic severely because the wait alone is bad - it is exhausting, then you kind of lose your momentum and forget to tell the doctor things which makes me more anxious - then I am fearful once I tell her my symptoms that she will tell me 5 different BAD deadly things that it could be and she wants to run a bunch of blood work and tests which then make me have panic attacks until the test day and then weeks until the results are in - the waiting for everything is the most difficult
0.881000	To hear any bad news like things are getting worse or that they don't have any other medicines/options to help my symptoms.
0.666700	I think it's just the stress of being there and seeing 5 different people including the doctor, who all do different things and can't answer my questions or come and go too fast for me to ask
0.619000	That I am surprised of his decision, I want to trust my doctor, I want to know that he thinks about my case and tries to help me not thinking of his financial profit. The times are changing and humanity is so important for this profession. I worry every time how expensive will be the next prescribed medicine and what are the side effects, I try to read everything carefully and when read the long list of side effects I become more and more frustrated. Sometimes the doctor is thinking about something else and doesn't listen to me, I have to repeat what I have said, that is confusing. 
0.190500	I worry some about pain or invasive physical procedures. I worry about something serious being discovered. I worry about encountering new germs and getting sick from visiting the doctor's office!
0.238100	I do not feel worried when I go to the doctor.  I believe in a simple and necessary procedure that does not require any additional alarm.
0.738100	"My doctor says I have classic ""white coat syndrome"".  My blood pressure rises considerably and I am flushed when I first go in."
0.476200	I am most worried that the doctor is going to find something wrong with me that will require medicine or hospitalization. I also don't enjoy talking about my weight with the doctor.
0.785700	Needles, blood and going to the doctors really stress me out. I can withstand pain, but seeing blood and needle scare me a lot. The thought of the needle piercing through my skin and drawing my blood out. I had a complete check out at one time long ago to determine the cause of my vertigo. My primary care doctor sent me to this lab. They took 4 tubes of blood from me. The worse part, they told me not to eat anything prior to the blood drawn. I almost faint. I was dizzy, and feel like vomiting. The nurse me to laid down and rest afterward. It was so crazy. 
0.690500	I think it may be the atmosphere or the ambiance of the doctors office. Its too quiet and smells like disinfectant. Iâm always feeling a little anxious and nervous when I have an appointment even when itâs just a check up/physical. I donât know... Iâve never thought about why it is that I get nervous when I go to the doctors.
0.714300	The biggest fear when going to the doctor is that something seriously wrong might be discovered. In fact, I have health anxiety, and the fear that a small normal sensation is cancer or some other disease is quite scary. That is what makes me nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.928600	I am self conscious about my body, so I don't particularly like having to undress or show certain parts of my body. I don't like to be touched and I am also sometimes concerned with what my diagnoses could be or other things unrelated to the reason I am there that the doctor might find. 
0.642900	Just the overall atmosphere tends to get to me. It's never set well with me, and I doubt that it ever will.
0.238100	Because the only one that knows everything is God. For that reason I fell very anxious because no matter I'm healthy and fit and try to be doing the right thing you never know when your luck or the destiny is on you're side because when is you're time is you're time.
0.166700	Well I have the normal worry of hoping that I don't have a serious conditions when ever blood tests etc are done. We all want to avoid bad news and pain. I know the irony is that avoiding the doctor heightens our chance of bad news when we finally do go. I learned this first hand when I when I had the emergency, telling myself that the pain in my chest and difficulty breathing was nothing to worry about. It turned out to be more serious than I thought.
0.595200	"I think what makes me feel the most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me but my gut is telling me that I know more about what is actually wrong than what my doctor knows.  Sometimes I wish instead of just treating a million different symptoms, they'd just treat the cause or say ""Look honestly, I don't know what's wrong"".  "
0.595200	I am afraid i'm going to get yelled at for something I have or have not done to take care of myself.
0.500000	I know I am not in the greatest health. So when I go to the doctor's office I am quite worried that she may end up giving me bad news. I also have a family history of heart trouble, so I am very scared about that. 
0.571400	Just the unknown. I tend to be a bit of a worry-wart, so knowing everything will be ok and that I don't have X, Y or Z is always a relief. As I ge older, I realize the difference between being vigilent and attentive to one's own health and being a bit paranoid.
0.642900	I'm afraid they or going to find something wrong with me. This brings me emotional and financial uncertainty. I am also afraid they will treat me,but something will go wrong which can harm me further.
0.309500	I feel most anxious if I need to have test done and need to wait for the results. I feel most worried if I am called in for a follow up appointment that I was not expecting.
0.333300	I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorder so it is something I struggle with in my day to day life.  However, going to the doctor sometimes causes my anxiety to increase just because I feel shy and awkward in the situation. 
0.500000	Not being able to know if something is wrong with me even though I feel quite healthy.  There could be something internal that we don't know and after doing blood tests are the times when I feel the most anxious to get the results back.
0.166700	Because I am male and my doctor is female and I am conscious of myself. I know she is a medical professional, but I just get a bit anxious. 
0.452400	Receiving bad news about my health. Overall, I'm healthy but something could pop up. Or if I go in for a certain reason and they can't provide good news about the condition. 
0.690500	That something will be wrong, that a slight twinge or pain I've had for a long time will turn out to be something terminal. And even though I've tried to be healthier, and do right by my life, and improve...that it all will be meaningless because I suddenly have some horrible disease (cancer, illness, etc.) that will cut my life short before I can get it back on track.
0.357100	I am overweight, so it just makes me anxious to have to weigh-in and discuss my weight with my doctor. It also makes me uneasy when I have to do things like pull up my shirt to have my stomach checked. 
0.571400	Sometimes I had white coat syndrome. This is when I went to the doctor's office my blood pressure would be fine and then she would take my blood pressure and it would be elevated.
0.738100	I am most worried about my doctor personally attacking me for my choices I have made. It is hard telling how he will act. 
0.642900	First off, I am generally an anxious person, so that doesn't help.  Mostly for me, it relates to the fact that I am going because something is generally wrong, or I am looking for medical advice.  When I either know or suspect that something is wrong, but I do not know what, it easily makes me anxious.  Combine that with the fact that I always have some sort of idea how the visit will go, but having the visit never go that way, I get easily anxious about the visit.
0.428600	I dont like when people touch me.. and even though i know him, i dont know him on a personal level like that. plus the germs at the doctor really bother me. 
0.142900	My health is pretty good so there isnât anything that I am really concerned about. I guess just getting my yearly physical. I hate getting that every year.
0.476200	Just wondering how things are going to go. If there's something wrong with me. I don't want to come out with bad news but most of my visits are pretty good. I stay real healthy and workout a lot.
0.333300	I generally do not feel too anxious when I visit a doctor. The only anxiety I feel, is if the problem is worse that I had imagined. But overall I do not feel worried. 
0.142900	Nothing. It's better to know than not to. I tend to think that mostly good things happen to me in life, because has been my experience thus far, so that is how I approach all situations...including visits to the doctor.
0.285700	It depends on the examination, but I am very self conscious of my body shape, and worry they will judge or laugh behind my back. 
0.857100	I don't want to be given things I am allergic to, and I want to feel better. Doctors don't always give me that feeling that I will feel better.
0.857100	You never know what they are going to find. Maybe they find something bad that always makes me very nervous.
0.381000	I am anxious or worried when I google symptoms myself and work myself up over what could be. I get worried that I may be sick with something contagious, especially when I am busy at work, because I often have to be at work to get certain things done. I also do not like being contagious because I worry I will get other members of my family sick.
0.238100	The unknown answer of what might be the issue. Unless Army doctors- then its the worry of laziness causing further harm. 
0.214300	It's more just a general worry of could anything be wrong or irrational things like even though I'm on birth control is it possible I'm pregnant random things like that. Not so much an actual I am worried because of my doctor or any real possibility.
0.666700	I usually have to go to the doctor for sick visits.  In that frame of mind, I am already uncomfortable.  I am usually worried that I will have a long way to recovery, or I will need to take expensive medication.
0.881000	If ever I am at a doctor's office, it is normally because I am experienced an unexplained medical issue. I am always worried about what could be wrong. I am a worst case scenario type of person. I always assume the worst and come prepared to hear the worst, whether that is true or not. I also get worried that I will leave the office without many answers as to what is going on. I typically have great blood pressure, but as soon as they take it at the doctors office, it is always much higher due to my nerves!
0.619000	Just get anxious that they may find something wrong with me that will change my way of life. I also feel like there is a good likelihood of me getting sick from other sick people when i go to the doctor
1.000000	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel anxious or worried about not being given a choice about anything that may be wrong. I also feel anxious about being poked and prodded as well as being told I need a needle to make me feel better instead of treating a problem, the doctor treats the symptoms.
0.357100	"The thing that makes me most anxious is when I do not believe my concerns are being addressed. For instance, a doctor did not want to discuss my ankle problem during a ""well woman examination,"" and gave me a lecture about this. She said I'd need another appointment. I wanted to ask one or two quesions before I agreed to do that and she cut me off. The ankle pain was having a significant effect on my quality of life."
0.904800	"I guess I am most worried that something will be seriously wrong with me, because I don't have time to be sick. Also, I am overweight--not more than 15-20 pounds--but some doctors make nasty remarks about it. I had one male doctor ask me, "" How do you expect to find a lover when you're fat?""."
0.642900	There is an element of wanting to stay healthy and be on track.  Thoughts might go to the measures you've taken such as exercise and diet to stay healthy.  Have these been adequate or is more required, and will you now be able to accomplish what will be asked of you?
0.404800	I'm most worried that they will find something very seriously wrong that I had no idea was going on with my body.  There are many stories of people finding out they have cancer or other diseases when it's too late, and they never had symptoms.
0.738100	Other sick people there, the wait times are long, whether the doctor has an accurate picture of my medical history.
0.714300	I am a generally anxious person and any interaction with a doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I am uncomfortable with my body and with the shape I am in so that plays into it as well. Mostly, I just feel like a freak and my problems are unusual or like the doctors are judging me and the shape that I am in. 
0.714300	I am afraid that a recurrence of a disease might occur. I am also allergic to many antibiotics, so any time that I have an infection, I am afraid that I will have a reaction if I am taking a new antibiotic. It is just a relief when the doctor tells me what the problem is and that it can be easily treated. 
0.261900	I do not feel anxious or worried.  I am prepared to accept anything that comes my way.  The only way I will be able to stop giving my murderis ex 65% of my only income, SS, is to die.
0.881000	It's always the fear and anxiety over wondering what's wrong with me. Do I want to know? No, but I have to. It's the anxiety of wondering if it's something serious. It's the anxiety of possibly receiving bad news. It's the anxiety of worrying about possibly having surgery. It's the anxiety of being surrounded by sick people in the waiting room. All of that combined makes me very anxious when I visit the doctor. And most of all, it's simply the anxiety of getting bad news that worries me the most.
0.142900	Can't say as I'm usually worried when visiting the doctor's office.  So, nothing? I pretty much know why I'm there and what the ultimate result/plan is going to be.
0.190500	Sometimes I think I have the white coat syndrome, especially when it comes to my B/P.  I used to be on B/P medication and it was getting too low so my doctor took me off the medication.  Now my B/P is slowly creeping back up.  I do not want to go back on the medication so everytime I go to the doctor and have my B/P checked, I am anxious about what it will be.
0.738100	Generally do not know exactly what is going to be done.  The rush of an appointment is so out of proportion to home much of your day had to be arranged to be there.
0.714300	It is mainly the fear of not getting any answers to my questions.  This as well as having my body examined by a somewhat creepy doctor who seems interested in me.
0.285700	I feel anxious about a potential upsetting diagnosis at times especially when a concern could be a symptom of a serious ailment like cancer
0.714300	I am always nervous around doctors because If I am at the doctor it is because something is wrong with my health that I have not been able to address by myself. That being said, I also am just nervous around unfamiliar people in general, and as a young and fairly healthy person, all doctors are unfamiliar. 
0.476200	I need to lose about 40 pounds, and I need to eat better.  I always have plans to do that but never get it done.  
0.261900	I just don't like being in a place that has sick people around since I get sick easily. I don't get extremely worried, but the thought of getting sicks is always just sitting in the back of my mind.
0.333300	the unkown in general. until you talk to them or test comeback there is no actual knowing.   its just wait wait wait wait. 
0.476200	If it is not a routing check up and there is some physical problem that caused me to go there than I obviously would be concerned that the result might show something I would not be happy about.
0.666700	I think it's just generally anxiety of being in a situation that isn't common and also the worry that they may end up finding that something is wrong even though I feel fine.
0.642900	If I have a particular symptom that could require major intervention, such as surgery, I become worried. Pain, particularly orthopedic pain, can often mean a chronic problem has developed wherein I will need surgery or will have to stop an activity. This makes me anxious. 
0.547600	I only feel anxious or worried, because I do not know what the outcome will be. I know the doctor will be a great help, but getting to the results is the anxious part. 
0.642900	Me personally, I have social anxiety disorder. So I feel uneasy just leaving my house. I feel like mine gives the most worst case scenario much of the time. I end up worrying a lot until they get the test results back. I have been told I might have cancer. False alert. I was told I have diabetes and had to stick my finger twice a day for a year. Just to have another doctor tell me I didn't have it. etc.
0.285700	When a doctor is condescending or makes you feel like you have done something wrong. It takes quite a bit to make me feel anxious and that will do it. I would only be worried about a specific diagnoses and I don't think that a doctor could control that.
0.833300	I'm not a big fan of being touched by people I don't know, even if it's by a medical professional looking for 'lumps' or what have you. I guess that makes me feel uneasy, but I also worry that one day I'll receive a negative medical diagnosis. 
0.333300	If I go in for something embarrassing and/or unpleasant. If I happen to have waited a little to long before I went to the Dr because I thought the problem would go away and didn't want to hear any bad news. 
0.904800	I always fear the worst, that something is really wrong with me. plus, I worry I'll be able to get all I need out of the appointment. 
0.452400	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong that I didn't notice.  Or that they will make negative comments about my life choices or lifestyle. 
0.333300	I am always anxious that anything I have that is bothering me will turn out to be something serious and untreatable. I always worry that I have cancer or will develop it at some point, because both my parents died of cancer. Although all my doctor visits are basically well visits, I still worry he will find something serious.
0.738100	I just don't like the process and while I'm not a full blown hypochondriac, my mother was and I just worry about if something will be wrong with me, even though I don't spend most of my daily life worrying about random sicknesses.
0.666700	When you are my age 66 any DRs visit can be worrisome. Your body breaks down with age. You worry that you are suffering from some kind of health issue.
0.642900	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office if I'm really sick. I feel this way because I wonder if something is seriously wrong with me. I think there may be other things wrong with me that the doctor may find that I didn't know about before. I wonder if there is something wrong with me that the doctor will not be able to cure or fix easily. I also think about how healthy I am in general compared to other people.
0.214300	I know I am a fairly healthy person I try to watch what i eat and exercise at lest three times a week, but even with all that you never know if the doctor finds something that is alarming. I never rule out a possibility of something bad occurring, that is why I try to limit these risks by choosing to live a healthy lifestyle.  
0.381000	I do not get anxious or worried about the actual examination or medical procedure itself, but more from a general misunderstanding of what is going on. I feel that I have no idea how much everything is going to cost and if I am even visiting the right doctor for the issue. If I am sick or have a medical issue, I don't know who to go to and do not understand how my health insurance policy works. 
0.238100	I would be most anxious and worried at a doctors visit if I was being tested for some form of cancer. I would worry that I would be confirmed for having a difficult or tough cancer to beat.
0.738100	I am worried frequently that they will again tell me nothing is wrong with me, despite a variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms that have persisted. I am also anxious that I will get overwhelmed and not be able to discuss my questions or accurately answer unexpected questions. 
0.523800	I am most anxious about the discovery of an underlying or latent condition that is not showing symptoms. I feel relatively fine and try to stay in good health but you never know what may come back in your blood work or what the doctor may find during an examination. 
0.238100	I still fear needles so I feel anxious when anything with needles is required. This includes vaccines and blood tests. Even the prick finger tests make me fear.
0.666700	When visiting my doctor for a routine check-up I'm generally calm and comfortable. I feel slightly anxious concerning lab results because that's what tells the true story. Visiting the doctor due to an illness causes the most anxiety because I know something is wrong. 
0.333300	That they will find something that is a medical problem. That my a1c will be too high. That my best efforts to take care of myself aren't good enough. 
0.714300	Feeling like a doctor missed something or I didn't speak up enough. That, and finding out something else that is just really awful.
0.857100	I never know if I'm going to get bad news. I've lost a lot of family members due to several different illnesses (walking pnuemonia, breast cancer, liver disease, etc.) so I'm always on edge that I could be next. 
0.190500	there is always an element of anxiety about any exam. doctors are people too.  are they having a good day? are they focused on me? do they have time to listen to me? do i really feel what i think i feel. will they believe me when i describe what i feel?
0.904800	I feel anxious overall. I would be anxious over the wait time in the lobby and not knowing what to expect at the appointment.
0.523800	Just knowing that I have to have Lab work done and hoping the results are going to be where they should be.
0.523800	"I always wonder what my diagnosis will be; I am a worrier and always ""WebMD"" things and blow things out of proportion. I look forward to meeting with my doctor because she helps to put things into perspective for me."
0.476200	Concern about what they may find and what they may have to say about my weight! :-) Other than that, I find it an enjoyable experience. 
0.357100	At times I feel worried about getting the results of my blood work. I feel relieved once I find out that there is nothing abnormal and I am in good health. 
0.547600	I'm overweight and very self-conscious/embarrassed by it.  I know I'm not taking the best card of myself and I just dread being told what I already know; it feels shameful.
0.714300	I am a bit (at least) out of shape and I have concerns that visiting will cause me to work on too many things that I know I should.  Lame, I know but I can live with it alright for now.
0.285700	how much time it will take, I don't like to wait.  other than waiting I don't mind going to the doctor's office.
0.714300	"A general health care facility doesn't always understand that some people are intelligent and they don't like when a patient says ""I don't want that"". "
0.190500	If that when I do go in for something minor he has to have a sit down with me in order to mention something serious.
0.642900	I always feel anxious or worried when visiting, just because if there is bad news to be given, that is where it is going to come from.  I am not the healthiest person ever, and I know that one day that could all backfire on me.
0.404800	The uncertainty is what makes me the most worried.  I am actually eager to get back the results as soon as possible so I could see what the issue is but waiting for it is what worries me the most.
0.523800	I feel anxious and worried when i feel like my doctor may give me some terrible news about my health
0.357100	I DON'T OFTEN VISIT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR MYSELF.  WHEN I DO GO TO A DOCTOR IT IS BECAUSE I AM EXPERIENCING AN ACUTE ILLNESS THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY WITH SELF CARE SUCH AS THE FLU.  I FEEL ANXIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS WRONG AND MUST USUALLY BE GUIDED INTO CONCLUSIONS.
0.142900	I sometimes feel anxious prior to arriving to the doctors office because of the unknown result. I believe that my condition can change from time to time and this causes a little worry. I trust my doctor's knowledge of medicine, his ability to diagnose conditions, and treated appropriately.
0.714300	That not only will something be wrong but something that I didn't even predict would be wrong as well.
0.523800	the possibility of the doctor discovering something i was unaware. while it's good they are able to identify anything which needs to be addressed, i'm obviously hoping that i leave the doctor with a clean bill of health. i'm always worried that this will not be the case. 
0.381000	Most of the time I worried that I might forget stuff that I need to tell him in order to help me with my condition.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor because I know everything will be okay with my doctors care.
0.595200	I'm most worried about the germs at the doctor's office and catching something from others. I don't want to get sick, even if I already am. 
0.238100	Being unsure as to what the doctor may tell me concerning my health. Going to the doctor does not always go the way I would like it to. I do not always get the best results. Doctors do find issues that have to be resolved.
1.000000	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried in a doctor's office would be the fact that they will be giving me news on something I don't wanna hear or they are telling me I'm going to have to give labs and give blood.
0.690500	The anxiety I believe comes from the uncertainty of what I might be told. Although I could leave the office with a clean bill of health there is always the chance you could find out you have a serious medical issue.
0.547600	I'm overweight, I don't like getting on the scales nor hearing about it. Otherwise not much else bothers me.
0.761900	I am always worried that the doctors will not listen to my concerns and take them seriously. Most doctors I have seen just wanted to give me medicines without actually trying to find the cause of the sickness itself. I am always worried when I see doctors now that they will not listen fully to my concerns. 
0.571400	The entire time. I don't just go for anything, but when I do it is usually serious. They have a tendency to treat people like cattle, and that makes it all the worse for an anxious person.
0.333300	I feel most anxious about how the interaction with the doctor will go, how I will be treated as a patient, and whether we can exchange the right amount of information to make informed decisions. 
0.666700	I don't like going to Dr's offices.  I think of sick people and death when I go there.  I lost a child at 19 weeks of pregnancy which makes me even more anxious when I am in a Dr's office.
0.547600	Sometimes you just do not know what they will find. I worry that they may tell me something is wrong that I had no idea existed, so I am always a little nervous. 
0.500000	I feel anxious going in for blood work, and while waiting for the test results for cholesterol or diabetes.  I fear the lifestyle changes that may result from bad results.
0.428600	I am sometimes anxious because i do not want to get bad news, or i am worried about the pain of a type of procedure 
0.738100	The most obvious answer for me would be either finding a potentially new problem or having an existing but controllable problem change or get worse.
0.309500	I'm a very self-conscious person, so sometimes I worry that something might be wrong with me. That's really the only anxious fear I ahve.
0.928600	The uncertainty of what's causing my problem makes me anxious or worried.  I have to be really sick and can not find any resolution on my own to go to a doctor.  I will have exhausted all possible natural solutions first before I consult a doctor.  I am anxious of what they will say is wrong and if they will judge me for my actions or inaction.  I worry that something is seriously wrong.  
0.738100	I am always worried and concerned that something serious has developed since my last appointment. Itâs a fear based on nothing in particular 
1.000000	I hate it when they arrive late. I'm left sitting in a filthy room, waiting for them to come in and put their cold hands on me. Once she arrives, she is busy logging on to her computer and trying to convince me that I need to go on some blood pressure medication when I've never had high blood pressure in my life. It shoots straight up when I visit the hospital in anticipation of ill treatment. 
0.547600	Only when it may result in permanent bad news. I try to stay in good shape and would be nervous to receive unexpected bad news. 
0.476200	I may have lost a ton of weight, but I'm still fat. I still have man boobs, and I absolutely hate taking off my shirt ever. I hate talking to people in a closed room about what's wrong with me.
0.214300	If it is not a routine office visit, I would be anxious/worried about what the test results are or what further testing is needed.  Maybe I need to have further tests to find out if anything is wrong, that makes me worried/anxious.
0.642900	I have aches and pains, and I really don't want to stop for surgery right now.  This would be my knees.  I sometimes feel afraid of worse diagnoses.  Plus my doctor doesn't hear me when I say the diabetes test is wrong.  I am diabetic and the numbers don't get good just like that.  Whatev.
0.428600	Finding out that something may be wrong. Having a couple of scary medical situations, of course, I'd feel uneasy. 
0.857100	I really only go to the doctor when I am sick.  I am overweight and I smoke.  I dread the lectures from the doctor. I know I should lose weight and I know smoking is bad for me.  The only reason I am there is to get help with whatever issue I have.
0.285700	Well, most of the time I have been to see the doctor is for a symptom that I am aware of and know the severity of it. Only once have I been not knowing and I was anxious but fully relieved after the diagnosis.
0.428600	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor's office would be them finding out I have some grave disease. I also feel worried when they overthink things like giving medications or going through procedures that are not necessary.
0.595200	Cancer runs in my family. So I am worried that the doctor will find a lump or a growth somewhere on my body when I get a physical(even though I am in near-perfect health)
0.809500	I do not like the fact that something might be wrong with me and I can't do anything about it. I do not like receiving shots either.
0.714300	I fear I won't be taken seriously, or that I will again be carelessly diagnosed or prescribed another harmful medication.
0.690500	I worry that something may be wrong with me that I don't know about. I worry the doctor will scold me for genuinely bad habits I have, like drinking and smoking, and how that might show in whatever results he is looking at. 
0.571400	I am most anxious that they will find something that is incurable and will end my life as I know it prematurally.
0.238100	Due to my anxiety, I just get worried about going out some places in general. The doctor's is one of those places because I am always worried about what is going on with my body. 
0.976200	I have felt anxious at a DR's appointment when they found something wrong with my health. This usually leads to fear and overthinking a condition or trying to guess the treatment plan.
0.500000	I always feel like this I'm about to get a cancer diagnosis or something. Or they're going to tell me I tested positive for the next black plague. 
0.547600	I'm now at the age where there is a possibility of receiving terrible news.  It ins't likely but still possible.
0.500000	If my pain or illness is something that is unsure of it worries me because I think it may be some serious thing that I have never encountered before
0.500000	I worry that my doctor is going to miss something serious because he is just going through the motions of another physical or exam instead of being meticulous and caring.
0.500000	The initial first visit for an issue I am having bothers me most. Without any knowledge from them yet I get very anxious. When they tell me the diagnosis I get worried. 
0.595200	I usually feel a little exposed and also uneasy about the unknown. There is always a little fear that something may be wrong with me. I am worried that the doctor may judge me for having a little extra weight or for not taking care of myself right. I am pretty self conscious so letting someone see or feel parts of my body that I wouldn't normally expose makes me anxious and uneasy. 
0.714300	"I don't like the possibility of being diagnosed with something bad. I also feel like I will have to do my ""homework"" such as individual research and seeking second opinions before agreeing with what my doctor says."
0.904800	I hate the anual exams, well woman check-ups. They make me anxious and uneasy. I do dread them. I don't know why, I just do. I also hate mamograms. They make me anxious too. They hurt.
0.523800	I am worried about getting bad news, I worry that I might have something terminal. I have medical anxiety so I avoid the doctor a lot.
0.357100	I used to get anxious and worried, but not anymore. My doctor has given me the trust and the confidence that everything is alright and that everything is going to be fine.
0.714300	If I feel I have a serious illness.  I would obviously be afraid because I'm afraid of getting sick.  I like being healthy and being in tip-top shape to do the things I love to do in life.
0.881000	I worry they may call me a liar. I worry they may not trust what I say about what is bothering me. I worry they may tell other people I'm a liar. I worry they may put false things in my medical chart.
0.142900	I don't really experience any anxiety when visiting the doctor.  I treat it as a normal activity that needs to get done. 
0.285700	There always is a feeling of dread that during a physical they will find something new and unexpected. The actual physical is not a problem. Though no one enjoys the blood draw.
0.285700	Concern about what they might find that is wrong with me, and concern that the doctor may not be able to do anything about what is wrong.
0.428600	I usually do not feel this way at all whenever i have to go to a doctors office. Again my doctor does a good job of making me feel like im at home, and not uncomfortable. The only time i may have these thoughts slip into my head is if i do not know what is wrong with me and im just acting a bit panicky and uneasy. 
0.666700	I feel anxious that there's going to be something really wrong with me, even if I'm feeling okay.  Just going to the doctor's makes me think about possible problems.
0.500000	The past experiences with my doctor. Howw she views me. Something i think u views me as more of a number than a perso n.
0.476200	Any feeling of anxiety when visiting a doctor is usually because I would be feeling particularly unwell or unsure about something, and as result am expecting there to be a real problem. 
0.285700	Usually nothing makes me feel anxious. If anything would make me feel anxious, I guess it would be that as I get older, I feel more likely to have them find something wrong with me. 
0.619000	The unknown to me is definitely the worst part. I often think of the worst thing that could happen and it's hard to think of anything else afterwords. Sitting in the waiting room also makes me feel anxious because I keep thinking about anything bad that could occur.  Finally, when the doctor starts talking too fast or talks about confusing things i get nervous that I will not understand something.
0.428600	I usually know what I am there for, or I have an idea of what my issue could be. I am able to put my trust in the doctor seeing me and I feel confident they will diagnose me with the correct issue. I'm sometimes anxious about what will happen, since I don't know ahead of time. Mostly I just want answers and relief, so I'm more than willing to let them do their job and help me.
0.690500	I feel worried that something might be wrong with me and don't want to find out the bad news. I also don't like showing my body to my doctor. It can be very awkward.
0.666700	I feel anxious or worried when I have to remove my clothes. Also, when I am concerned that my problem may be serious.
0.857100	I am not a doctor so I don't have the knowledge or equipment to test and find factual results and when you do your own research or diagnosis it usually looks more bad than good and you don't know what's going on for sure.
0.404800	"going to see a doctor is never pleasant but i rarely experience any severe anxiety.  i certainly don't experience dread.  i think one reason for this is i'm about to turn 62.  i realize that although i'm not VERY old, most of my years are in the past and i know it's inevitable that my health, at some point, will take a negative turn and perhaps a drastic one.  i can deal with that because, as the old saying goes, ""none of us get out of here alive.""  i think i can deal with whatever i learn at any medical appointment.  the only time i'd be real anxious is if i knew i was facing a painful procedure."
0.428600	I am most worried that they are not going to listen to what I am describing as my actual problem. And only listen to key words that I might say. 
0.761900	What makes me feel most anxious is being misdiagnose with a terminal disease like cancer or HIV when i never really had it. I'm scared to get vaccinations when i'm healthy because i feel it will only make me susceptible to those diseases. I believe the only thing that gets sick is your mind and if i begin to feel helpless due to a misdiagnosis, my immune system will get weaker and the virus will be easier to take over my body & emotions.
0.952400	I worry about the doctor giving me a lecture about my weight or other lifestyle choices. I am also afraid of being told that something could be wrong with me, especially something that I could have prevented if I had taken care of myself better or come in more urgently. I also worry sometimes if I will be taken seriously when I list my concerns and symptoms, or if they will be brushed off.
0.500000	Coming out with some diagnosis that I did not expect. Also coming up with something that would be expensive to treat.
0.142900	The only time I feel anxious at the doctor's office is when I feel like I may be receiving bad results.  Other than that I never feel anxious or worried while visiting my doctor's office. My doctor puts my worries at ease.
0.523800	The biggest concern is that a serious, non-treatable issue will be uncovered.Going hand in hand with that is that treatment for an uncovered medical issue might not be affordable.
0.285700	Mostly, it is the fear of the unknown. I have high blood sugar, and I am always concerned that my doctor might tell me that I am a diabetic. That would be very traumatic for me. This relates to my weight, and I worry what my doctor's scale will show for that.
0.452400	I have brain tumors. They've been controlled and benign for a few years now. I'm always fearful they will come alive again or others will develop. I get MRIs a couple times a year, and I'm always anxious waiting to hear the results of those.
0.690500	it's inconvenient to take time out of a work day to be at a doctor's office.  i don't like the feeling that i may or may not get a solution to the problem i came in with.  i don't like not knowing what's wrong with me, and not knowing if the doctor i'm about to see will be able to help or not.  
0.547600	This is easy, I am always worried about cancer or some unknown thing that will kill me. I am constantly asking questions, trying to understand everything and then making sure without a doubt that I am either fine or take steps to get better.
0.761900	I am a young guy with an old guy's problem. I have a high pain tolerance and have been dealing with my ailment for at least 10 years. Most doctors don't seem to believe me when i say i am in almost unbearable pain. I feel like doctors think i'm lying about my problems to get painkillers which is not the case. I fantasize about the day when I won't need to take any medication. I get very anxious when describing my symptoms and lack of healing or improvement because I feel defensive every time i see a doctor,.
0.142900	i never felt anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office. Its always good to have occasional visit to the primary care physician for preventive care 
0.595200	I am concerned about if they find a serious condition that could be life-altering or life-threatening.  I am not concerned about them but what they might discover.
0.904800	I worry a lot about how I am going to pay for it. Then I wonder if thing are as bad as the seem ur are the trying to get more money. I get scared that they are going to tell me there is something wrong that I can't come back from.
0.785700	I rarely go into the office unless I have noticed something is very wrong with me. I generally tend to let things get to a bad point before reaching out for professional medical help.
0.285700	The only time I'm worried if there is something wrong that I haven't had looked at yet or if I'm waiting for results.
0.595200	Since I'm getting older I start to worry that something will be wrong with my heart, or the doctor will say I have to drastically change my diet and all the good foods like cheeseburgers and milkshakes will have to be eliminated. It's mainly just my aging that makes me nervous that this will be the visit where something has gone wrong that I never even noticed.
0.238100	It's the normal. Everyone is afraid of dying. I'm no different. I'm  anxious that the doctor will find something and it will be something horrible, something fatal, something no one can do anything about. My mother went to the doctor for knee and came out having found out she had a slow moving form of liver disease. It can happen. You can go in with a minor ache or pain and come out knowing what's going to kill you.
0.428600	Usually I get worried because the outcome is unknown and I am not sure what is going to happen. I think alot of this fear is due to not wanting to have some major medical issue come about such as cancer or other very prominent diseases. Also it is not somewhere you go very often and is usually associated with death, illness and pain so these places are naturally scary to someone who doesnt go often or is awaiting a bill of health. Also the cost is another concern and can cause stress in someone who visits because something simple can still be expensive. 
0.785700	I have had nurses and doctors underestimate pain, so I am constantly worried that I will not be taken seriously or believed. 
0.547600	Even if I'm perfectly healthy for some reason I get a little anxious because you can never know what will really happen. There are people younger than me that have died from cancer and horrible things, so it's always in the back of my mind.
0.714300	From the beginning, when they leave you in the room alone after taking your basic vitals is nerve wracking. It's you alone in a room and you don't know if they've forgotten you and you constantly run through all the possible worst-case-scenarios in your mind. Being alone is the scary part. 
0.785700	I feel worried and anxious that I will receive bad results or told that I am dying. I'm worried I'm not living a healthy enough lifestyle and it will show up on my tests.
0.190500	"I am usually not anxious or worried. I suppose I would be if I was expecting a test result that could possibly be ""bad news."""
0.666700	I've always been an anxious person, I tend to think it's because my mother died when I was young. Going to the doctor for anything serious, or a new pain or issue is very nerve wracking for me. It makes me worry about death and what would happen to my kids if god forbid something happened to me.
0.523800	I always think there is going to be something wrong with me, or it will be even more negative I get worried cause all of my health issues.
0.523800	I dont know if I will have good news at the end or bad news. It makes me nervous to go through something like it.I dont like the uncertainty of what the outcome might me
0.857100	I don't like the feeling of not knowing what they are going to do to me. I hate blood and I hate needles. I like to know what to expect when I go places.
0.238100	I am most anxious when I see a needle for a shot because I have a strong physical reaction to them and feel uncomfortable, but I know it will pass
0.904800	I worry about what the outcome may be.  If something is seriously wrong with me.  (like getting cancer for instance)
0.285700	I am always worried that I may get bad news in any dr office. I am nervous I may get bad news and I may get. 
0.785700	I feel most anxious and worried in a doctor's office because I am uncomfortable in a setting where I feel vulnerable and alone. I don't like one on one settings with someone I barely know. I don't want to be uncomfortable talking about something I don't want other people to know about, or the doctor having to examine me naked.
0.785700	I feel worried or anxious when visiting the doctors because I am not used to doing so. I don't like how white and clean and empty the patient rooms are, how odd and sterile they are. I don't like having the possibility to be told that there is something seriously wrong with me either.
0.857100	Well, having been misdiagnosed and, on other occasions, groped by doctors in an inappropriate sexual way (especially by 2 ob/gyn practitioners) has resulted in my being anxious and worried whenever I visit. One misdiagnosis nearly cost me my life--thank goodness I was able to figure out what was wrong--I then marched back to the doctor's office and demanded the right course of treatment. I have also been subject to Dr. Perverts--as in two ob/gyns who sought fit to check my breasts for cysts by groping them for long periods of times. One ob/gyn even closed his eyes and smiled as he squeezed my breasts and told me afterwards how beautiful my breasts were. Suffice to say, I feel anxious, worried and very much on guard when visit the doctor's office. 
0.642900	I am naturally an anxious person and I worry a lot, even when there is nothing to worry about my mind just starts going and I start worrying about a lot.  So just going in to the doctor's office makes me anxious.  I will worry something horrible is wrong with me.  I am not anxious about seeing the doctor as my doctor is great.  Its just everything that goes along with it.  Mostly just the thoughts in my head.
0.523800	I generally feel anxious or worried.  I feel uncomfortable and cold in the doctor's office.  I am usually stressed because I've had to drive in traffic from a distance.  I get social anxiety.  I am sometimes a bit uncertain about the results.  When I get checkups, I am generally expecting them to go well especially if I haven't had any issues prior to coming.  But you never know if some test result or exam comes back questionable and you have something serious or concerning wrong with you.  Or some expensive testing procedure that of course insurance won't cover.  Money and pricing is always a concern with doctor visits.  Sometimes I feel strange that every doctor can see all my previous digital health information which makes me uncomfortable.  Many times I feel violated for having to sign away all my rights in the paperwork.  And the office staff is usually rude and abrupt and treats you less than humanely.

0.428600	The discovery of a new ailment that would lead to new treatments and medicines with uncertain outcome.  You always want to be healthy, but sometimes as you age you are not sure whether something may pop up unexpected.  Also, as you age the number of tests and labs seem to increase. This leads to a time of worry and anxiety to get the results back.  Hopefully, the doctor can put your mind at ease if relevant that the tests are just a precaution. So you do not have to worry while waiting.  Otherwise, you can just try to lead the healthiest life possible and go in to the office confident that you are ok.

0.285700	My doctor's office has always been very kind and welcoming. The only things that can make me feel anxious at my doctors office are the financial and insurance aspects of my visit. Even then the people there are always understanding and willing to try and accommodate my every need.

0.357100	"I just think the overall of feeling of  ""what are they going to say about my current health status.""  Once the examination is completed and they begin to talk, I'm no longer anxious"
0.666700	I get most worried or anxious when I visit the doctor's office, whenever I have to take my little one to see a doctor. I get more worried because I don't take my kids to the doctor unless they are really ill and I see a lot of media talking about really dangerous, possibly deadly, flu's and other illnesses out there. I worry about these because a child can easily get these illnesses from just being at the store and someone sneezes or coughs. They can even get sick if someone coughed on an item in the store and I touch it and then hold my kids. Being a parent is already worrying but having to worry about their health whenever something like this arises, is very stressful and irritating because I tend to get really antsy and nervous while waiting for the doctor's diagnosis. I had to take my daughter to the ER a few times because she had a high fever temperature, and at the time there was a big outbreak of the flu that was nationwide and causing deaths for some young kids and the elderly. Because of this reason, I decided to take my daughter to the doctor to make sure she was alright. She ended up being fine but just the information on the news and the media and her being sick just made the whole situation nerve wrecking. 
1.000000	Money. I have no insurance so if there's something serious and I have to be rushed to the hospital, I will never be able to pay for it. I would rather they just leave me on the examination table to die than help at that point. I'm already in debt because of college loans; I literally can't afford to be in any more debt than I already am.
0.142900	I feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor if I have had some signs that something might be wrong.  Also, when I have my yearly exam I always hold my breath until my blood work comes back.  I am always afraid that something might show that something is wrong.
0.666700	There's the concern that something could be wrong. I avoid testing altogether. There's just a generalized anxiety with visiting the doctor as well as it can feel like an invasion of privacy.
0.904800	I always worry that an incurable problem will be discovered and /or that I will find out terrible news about my health.
0.928600	I worry about needing painful procedures. Even innoculations scare me. I cannot stand the thought of a needle piercing my flesh and gouging a hole in a muscle. I get all worried and my blood pressure sky rockets as I enter the doctor's office.No matter what I do to calm down I remain very anxious.
0.285700	My family is prone to diabetes, high blood pressure and even a case of ovarian cancer.  I am not typically worried or anxious unless I have a pain or illness I cannot identify as a familiar feeling.
0.142900	The only thing that makes me anxious or worried is that my concerns will be ignored. Which they usually are.
0.571400	I think that the time constraints upon my doctor visit. I don't know what to discuss with them and it seems that if I bring up too much, I may be charged for an extra visit. And, when I bring up something with my primary care physician, it will probably result in one or more referrals which I prefer to avoid.
0.547600	I don't want to figure out I have cancer or some other type of illness.  I also feel anxious cause I have to get home to my kids and the doctor's wait times can be long.
0.785700	I always feel like they are not looking at serious underlying conditions that are not so obvious.  They never seem to want to do any tests that would uncover internal issues.

0.142900	If I'm in there for a specific reason, I can feel anxious sometimes. Even with that, I know that they will do the best they can to help me or find someone who can help. 
0.571400	if i was really sick or in pain and i didnt know why then i would be fearful, other than that im usually very calm
0.904800	I'm not a particular fan of people getting in my personal space and touching me. I know they need to at some points during exams but I am most definitely not a fan. 
0.619000	I have a general anxiety towards all doctors and healthcare providers. My doctor I trust very well but I still feel somewhat anxious when seeing any kind of healthcare provider. This is something that I just have to deal with when seeing a doctor.
0.619000	I have a chronic condition that killed my mother. I am always worried that it will become worse. Secondly is the unknown. By that I mean what if something new has cropped up? I am a passenger in this body and I will not get a second one. There is always the uncertainty of the unknown.
0.714300	If I'm going there about something that I've noticed as a problem, I fear that it is some bigger problem that could be painful/long treatment to fix if it is even fixable.  I also know there are some issues in my family that could someday present themselves in me and I really don't want to have those problems.
0.381000	I sometimes am worried about the outcome or what I may find out. Don't want there to be something wron with me. that is waht I get most worried about.
0.142900	I think the thing that makes me feel most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me and don't know if the doctor will know as well. When I was diagnosed with chronic hives I was always anxious or worried when meeting with the allergist because I wasn't confident that the hives would go away and the situation would be resolved. The fear of them not knowing what to do when I have no idea what to do is what gets me worked up. 
0.833300	I really do not like being there in the first place and then having them tell me what I am doing wrong in my life makes it that much worse. I am worried that they will tell me something bad or find something really wrong with me. I am almost in the mindset that it is better not to know what is going on. I know that is bad but I worry way to much about everything to begin with. 
0.761900	Anything medical sets off my anxiety. I'm always afraid they are going to find something so terrible that it can't be dealt with. Frankly, I rather not know and be happy if that is the case. 
0.428600	Hearing bad news or being told that you have a medical condition. Also if the doctor will be caring about the health of his/her patients.
0.357100	Don't really like someone proding or poking me or asking personal questions. I also don't like the idea of something going on that I may not be aware of that could have major complications on my life and my family. 
0.619000	If it is a routine office visit I'll likely not be anxious or worried since I don't anticipate any unpleasant surprises. If the appointment is due to a new or on-going problem I'm most worried about whether or not there is an easy solution to this particular health issue.
0.547600	I hate waiting. They ask all these questions and when you're healthy it just seems like a waste of time. I could have filled out a form and gotten the same answer: You are well.
0.285700	I'm worried that I won't present my case or issues well, and that I'll be brushed aside. My doctor doesn't have intimate knowledge of my history, and I'm worried I'll somehow leave out information that would help them identify my problems.
0.404800	I often worry I have a new medical condition or that an old condition has returned. If that happened I would have to take new medications and have longer visits with my doctors.
0.142900	I don't feel dread with most doctors. I dread getting any sort of OB-GYN exam for obvious reasons.  (It's weird, intrusive, and unpleasant.)  With new doctors, I worry about being dismissed as not knowing my own body or not being taken seriously.  
0.571400	I am always anxious or nervous that something is wrong with me, or that they will find something that is abnormal.  I also just get uneasy in hospitals/doctor's offices in general.
0.785700	I feel very anxious when I am sick because I don't like not being in control. I don't know that the doctors make me feel any more anxious but they don't necessarily alleviate that anxiety.
0.547600	I usually not too anxious going to the doctor but there is some there.  You always here the horror stories of healthy people going in for a routine checkup and walking out with a serious disorder.  That is scary.  
0.619000	I usually feel very calm when I'm at the doctor's however, I am for the most part in good health. I guess the only anxiety I have would be them telling me I have a terminal illness or something horribly wrong. 
0.142900	Well honestly I rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor.  The only time I can see myself being worried about my condition is when I have something that might be seriously wrong with me and it is more of a reaction to the condition than to the doctors visit itself.  I tend to be a pretty calm individual in most situations so it rarely ever comes up.  Though what exactly makes me worried more than anything is simply the possibility of a condition that can only be treated and not cured but I think that is something that bothers most people in general.
0.785700	The cold sterile setting is rather unnerving, causing my anxiety levels to skyrocket. Knowing that anything I say to the doctor could be taken out of context and cost me my License/Job/Freedom due to a simple misunderstanding. The waiting can also cause stress and worry. It seems to take forever for a doctor to even make it into the room to examine you, and even longer to come back and explain what steps are next. Finally, Even when I know what is wrong, or the reason I am there and try to explain why or what helps because I've been through it before, I'm treated like an idiot or a criminal, or a faker while they order more tests to make my bill even higher. 
0.428600	I am the kind of person who always gets nervous in a doctors office. I just get nervous about the fact that they could find something wrong. Typically, I calm down once I start talking but I am still a bit on edge until I leave even if I have a great visit. I think it is just a natural fear inside of me. 
0.785700	That the doctor is just going to say anything. That doctors dont care to actually really examine a patient. They just have a goal to prescribe a prescription for anything and any reason.
0.547600	I just don't like having to go to the doctor. The waiting around, being around other people. Feeling like I might be wasting their time. 
0.976200	I'm honestly not scared of needles, shots or anything like that. I have many tattoos and piercings so to me a shot or needle is nothing at all. I get so uneasy and worried to the point that I'm nauseous. I think it's because I overly worry that the doctor is going to find something or say I'm sick with something, I'll need further testing elsewhere, or I have only a few months to live. I know that's like the extreme, but that really terrifies me just incase. I also worry that the doctor or nurses know something I don't and they won't tell me and talk about it behind my back or something weird like that.
0.261900	Worried that the diagnosis will be negative and effect my life. If it involves a procedure I get worried about the pain and not being able to control it when I leave the doctors office. 
0.785700	First and foremost, I hate going to the doctor office simply because I do not want to be around other sick people.  I'm afraid that I might pick up some sickness from someone else and then end up feeling actually worse than I already was feeling.  Also, I hate just sitting in the doctor office because it seems like they are so slow about calling you back to actually see the doctor.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when I see the doctor. I go in to the office with a good attitude. There is always a chance that he could find something seriously wrong,but I will face hat when it happens,not before.  
0.142900	I do not get nervous when visiting the doctor's office. Getting anxious accomplishes nothing so I do not waste my energy on it.
0.690500	The not knowing what might happen.  Also the overall wait time.  It seems to take forever between the check in and check out process
0.238100	It is mostly that the experience will be unpleasant, not that the examination will find something wrong.  I'm also a little bit worried about being lectured on my bad habits, or pressured to do something expensive that I don't really need.
0.619000	I tend to get anxious about having to go to the doctor's because of the unfamiliar environment and what the possible outcome is during my visit. I also get worried about the drive there because I don't like driving. I also feel uneasy having to explain my problems, especially if they're embarrassing. 
0.761900	I have social anxiety and any time I have to go to an office and talk about personal things it's very difficult for me.
0.166700	I fear that something will be wrong with me, that I will be sick and I won't know it, and when they find out it will be too late.  But that is just a general feeling and doesn't really have too much to do with doctor visits, per se.
0.142900	I worry a little bit that a disease might be found...my dad had cancer for instance, I want to avoid that.
0.285700	The only thing that would make me feel anxious when visiting a doctor is if I have something that could potentially be serious. I would be worried about it being something worse than what I think it is.
0.238100	I am hoping to get the most out of my visit. I want to be able to be comfortable with my doctor for future purposes.
0.714300	It is a little unnerving having to unclothe and have a doctor prod around in private areas. I know it has to be done, but it makes me uncomfortable.  I am anxious about the exam itself more than finding out something is wrong.  Doctors try to make patients feel comfortable about this, but it's not easy. 
0.142900	I feel anxious or worried if there is a new employee .Example the person who take your blood. If he or she is new I do not know if they have enough experience.. I will not let them  stick me with a needle several times to get blood.
0.285700	I get anxious when I don't know the doctor and do not have a rapport or have had a bad personal experience with the doctor. 
0.547600	My blood pressure always goes higher in the doctor's office. I check it at home and know what it is.  Then I get a lecture on the blood pressure and then I get a lecture on my weight.
0.738100	I am often unsure of what protocol my doctor will implement. I also feel insecure abut myself and physical condition and this makes me anxious in the doctor's office.
0.690500	I am most anxious if they grab my nuts. I hate when they have to examine everywhere it's just uncomfortable and they need a new procedure. That is just wierd.
0.738100	I just do not know if they will find out that something is wrong with me. I usually feel healthy but there is always a little uncertainty that something might be wrong without me knowing. 
0.642900	I'm not sure.  Even though my doctor is one of the best ones I have been to, I still get nervous at the visits.
0.714300	I am most anxious when awaiting results. The unknown is always the most stressful for me, because I can't figure out how to proceed. I also don't particularly like needles, but it is more the time between seeing the needle and it actually going into my arm that is stressful. 
1.000000	I worry about getting really bad news one day. I worry the doctor will find some condition or disease that has cause irreversible damage.
0.523800	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office is them finding something that is seriously wrong with me. In some degree, everyone fears dying and living a lifestyle where they virtually have none. I do not go to see a doctor very often at all and when I do, It's usually for something pretty serious. Therefore I worry a bit because I obviously do not completely know how the outcome may be.
0.785700	I feel uncomfortable in general in a doctor's office. I feel worried about being touched by someone who is generally a stranger.
0.738100	Test results are usually the because factor because I feel like the doctors sometimes focus on the test result and no other factors. I feel like I shouldn't be the only one fighting for my health. 
0.738100	When it comes to visiting the doctor the thing that makes me the most worried is simply not knowing how things will you. I hate that there is a possibility that I can get some really bad news that would cost me financially, physically or mentally. It's very nerve racking. 
1.000000	What makes me feel most worried anxious is when my doctor is rushing me to see another pather...this is when he overbooks.
0.690500	I feel most anxious about medical exams because I've experienced many life threatening medical issues that have required emergency surgery. I am fearful of death, and also of pain, and having to spend months of recovery. Also the loss of income, and the ability to provide for my family. 
0.738100	I am not good with needles, and I have had a bad experience in the past when they pricked my finger. I almost passed out, so they had to take me back into a room. I ended up having a blood blister and bruising on my finger for the next few days. 
0.142900	Nothing, I know that I am in good hands with my present doctor. Previous to him I would be anxious and scared because I knew that I was wasting my Co pay on not being treated for my issues. I o lying go to the doctors office maybe once or twice a year, when something is severe, so I am in no way shape or form a hypochondriac. 
0.142900	I think that it would be the part about receiving the worst information about your health. I think that interacting with your doctor should not make a patient anxious or worried, what worries me is receiving bad news from the doctor. Waiting for those test results is also very worrisome. 
0.142900	I worry that I will get sick from other people there.  I worry that I will hold the doctors back with my long appointments. I worry that my insurance will not cover something.
0.381000	That I will hear bad news, or that I will be told something that will frighten me. I would not like to hear something negative regarding my health if I do not need to. I also dislike hearing possible diagnoses, when there is no reason to be worried about them. 
0.428600	exams are unpleasant,  worry about what might be found.  not fun sitting in a paper gown waiting 30 mins in a cold room for the dr to show up.   
0.500000	I'm not really sure what makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office.  Maybe it's the feeling of not being 'perfect' - not eating well enough, not having the perfect weight, not having the perfect blood pressure, etc. - and it seems that the doctor is always finding fault with something.
0.476200	Wondering what the outcome of my exam would be. Imagining if there is something wrong and what needs to happen next.
0.214300	My family has an extensive history of health issues and each time I go to my doctor I am concerned that he is going to find something or diagnose a condition.  Often times I am waiting on the test results to see if everything is fine or not and that makes me anxious.
0.714300	That they are going to tell me that something is seriously wrong with me. Not really anything in particular but that something will require some surgery or a massive change in lifestyle. I always think about having cancer, or how scared I would be if I had to undergo a major surgery. If I'm going in for say blood tests, I'm going to worry that my blood tests are going to show that I have major health issues, etc. I still always have these worries and fears, despite the fact that I've yet to have anything like that occur. It's always something minor, but I always am terrified of something major.
0.523800	For me to show up at the doctor's office with a complaint means that I am acknowledging that I am experiencing something that is beyond my capability and that I need help with. Just there I am going to be anxious going in. And if there are concerns shown for my tale of woe and tests ordered than I am going to be a little bit worried just not knowing what the test will show.
0.523800	Cancer is always a fear and imaging scares me in case of that. After diagnosis where medications can help, I feel better.
1.000000	I have had so many of them refuse to treat me I am scared every time I walk in. I have had to travel around states and the country finding care. I am fully aware I may not get treated and not to take it personally. I am tired of being called crazy or a liar when I am really sick and NOT feeling well.
0.452400	Sometimes I feel anxious that what I think is some pretty minor thing will end up being something major.  Or that I will be one of the cases that end up in the news of doctors doing something totally wrong for the patient (amputating the wrong leg, etc.).  I also don't care for shots...
0.642900	I feel most anxious if I am actively having a health issue and have to wait a long time to be seen. Waiting a long time causes me to go to worst case scenario in my mind and by the time I'm in the exam room I am sometimes a bit nervous.
0.214300	What would make me feel anxious is if they were new in treating me. I would worry about whether or not we would have a good rapport. I would also worry about whether or not they were a holistic doctor or if they just wanted to push pills. I would also feel anxious if I was worried I had something bad going on. 
0.452400	It makes me nervous. I hate weighing in. I do not like that sick people germs in the office. I don't like having to take my clothes off and get in that paper gown. It usually ends up ripping and that's always uncomfortable when that happens. Noone likes to wait to hear if there's bad news. It's always uncomfortable even when I like my doctor. It could be a head game for all I know?
0.381000	Because I am getting older and am reaching the age when all of the men in my family either have died already or been diagnosed with cancer, I am anxious about that history and the likelihood that it is ineveitable that it will happen to me, and that this likelihood increases with age, and it will be a doctor visit that fisccloses that the end is coming soon.
0.142900	That I will only bring important things to discuss with him.  That I listen to what he says and follow his orders.
0.142900	doctors visits usually never make me feel ill at ease. i am in pretty good health and dont have much to worry about.
0.238100	Family history of blood pressure issues. This always crosses my head as I been told that while my blood pressure is still within the normal range , it is in the higher borderline. The second this that pops to my head is that you never really know if everything is 100% fine. You may feel fine but may still be sick.
0.190500	I feel anxious when i think something major is wrong. This is what makes me very worried and stressed out and I hate that feeling. I hate knowing that a test is pending as it bothers me a bit. It really gets to me overall.
0.595200	I am very anxious when I am waiting to see the doctor because I am always afraid that my insurance coverage won't be valid and that I will have to pay my medical bill out of my pocket. I get anxious with the thought of getting a disease or infection while sitting in the doctors office.
0.595200	I am anxious about my condition, whether it is improved or worsened. Because I am really trying to take care of myself with respect to this condition, I am really worried if it is not working in the good direction.
0.833300	When I go in for something where I'm not sure what the diagnosis is going to be.  Like in my latest example regarding the cyst found in my thigh.  When I went in for examination, I didn't know if it was going to be a tumor or cancerous or a blood clot.  If I was just going in for a physical checkup, it wouldn't be as nerve racking.  However, even then, you never know if they're going to find something wrong with you and that is always a little unnerving.
0.761900	I get nervous when visiting the doctor. Its been like that for a long time but my GP tries to make my visit as comfortable as possible
0.214300	Uncertainty about a diagnosis that I am concerned about. It's hard not to let information on the internet cloud your judgment, which can lead to anxiety about a diagnosis.
0.381000	finding out that something is more serious than I anticipated. getting sick from others at the doctors office makes me a little anxious as well
0.238100	There's always some amount of concern and anxiety associated with getting test results, because you never know what they might show. 
0.381000	I don't get anxious too often with doctors, they are there to help. The only part that makes me anxious is not knowing what the problem is and how costly the fix will be. More often than not it's expensive or time consuming.
0.261900	I just have a general anxiety that I'm not providing the correct information or that there is something wrong that I don't know about. I also don't like needles or pain so I get uneasy that blood tests will be ordered.
0.285700	When visiting a new doctor's office for the first time I often feel worried they won't be able to help me fully or prescribe a medication that works for my body.
0.142900	There is very little that makes me anxious.  Doctors dont make me anxious at all.  I just don't enjoy hearing possible bad news.
0.190500	Typically, its a situation when I know something is wrong with me, but I'm also aware that the costs may be too expensive to do anything about. I had a tonsil infection, and I was unable to eat comfortably for days. I didn't know how much the medicine would cost and I had to pay out of pocket. It cost me $300 at the urgent care to get treated and to be able to eat again. It's always an affordability issue.
0.285700	That i might not get what i want done. That iâll pay a lot of money for no benefits.  I do not have anxiety about visits.
0.452400	I feel most anxious when there is an awkward kind of conversation, I'd rather just sit and listen to music or something and relax than have to converse.
0.523800	White coat syndrome. Usually when I attend the doctor it's something I've decided isn't going away by itself (common cold etc) so I usually am anticipating the worst at the appointment. 
0.714300	I'm anxious about being around people in general, and going to the doctor is not too much better. I am in good health thankfully, so I usually only go in for minor stuff.
0.142900	I have only felt anxious around a new doctor once or twice. This anxiety would likely be multiplied if the care provider were significantly younger than myself. Otherwise, I don't have issues with anxiety surrounding doctors appointments.  
0.500000	That I might get a bad diagnos8s I fear that something might be really wrong with me I also don't like needles so I am scared I might need to take a shot
0.738100	i dislike any procedures that involve needles or injections.  plenty of general procedures really aren't very pleasurable. there are plenty of other places i'd rather visit than the doctor's office.

0.833300	I fear what the doctor might tell me. I will worry from the day I make the appointment until I finish the visit. If I were dying, I don't think I would want to know. Doctors don't seem to understand this fear.
0.285700	It depends on the reason for the visit. If it is for a minor ailment, there is no reason to be anxious. I have no reason to feel anxious about a visit unless I the doctor gives me reason to be. i.e. bad health news
0.595200	I feel most anxious at the doctor when  I have an unexpected pain that I need looked at. I get anxious because I never know what the outcome will be. I have a huge fear of cancer, not a fear of dying from it but a fear of having to fight it.

0.571400	Probably being told that there are more serious issues than I though there was and having to do more treatment. 
0.357100	I'm always just a little worried something really bad will come up in the visit. I try to be completely honest about my physical condition, but I fear the doctor might discover something really serious about my health. I'm in a career field where my physical health (and lack of prescription medications) is extremely important, so I wouldn't want anything to come up that would affect my work.
0.619000	My doctor is very blunt, so when I go to him I am a little nervous. He will tell me if I gained weight and he will usually talk about it with me constantly throughout the visit.  I'm usually worried that he will tell me that there is something seriously wrong with me. Thats been my fear for awhile. I just hate sitting in the office because I feel like there are a lot of germs and I will get sick.
0.785700	I do not like being scrutinized with weight, blood pressure etc. I would prefer to never go to the doctor, however I know I need to. I don't always feel that doctors are really listening to all of my symptoms and I don't like taking unnecessary medications.
0.714300	I get anxious and worried because I feel like something is going to pop up in my health records that is just going to throw my life for a loop. It seems like having a doctor officially diagnose something makes it just that much more real and scary.
0.333300	That there might be something seriously wrong with me, my heart rate or oxygen levels are down, my blood work came back bad, the pain in feeling is something bad.
0.666700	I'm a single mom. I have two teenagers who rely on me and my financial and emotional support. I am the one constant in their lives. The one person they couldn't live without.  This is mainly the reason for my anxiousness when I visit the Dr's. I want to be there for my children as long as I possibly can.
0.714300	One of the things is my weight. I've always been overweight and I dread even getting on the scale and another person knowing my weight. I also worry I'll be lectured about it or it will be named as a cause for whatever ailment I might have. I often don't go to the doctor when I should so that my weight is never known or discussed. I also worry about my issue, which I may think is trivial, turning out to be something more serious than I thought.

0.357100	I'm worried to get bad news and I don't particulary enjoy needles. I try to, however, be mature and remain realistic. Whether we're perfectly healthy or struggling with a medical condition, we just have to do our best to achieve the best quality of life and health as possible.

0.571400	I would normally be anxious about my weight, my blood pressure, and my other health indicators. If the numbers are not good I might get scolded by the doctor, or worse, they might indicate I am not healthy. I would also feel anticipation to hear the results because I would be hoping for good numbers instead of bad ones. I would feel worry that I might get health news that I do not like.
0.619000	With everything all over social media and the news sometimes it makes it hard not to think about what ifs.  Everything is bad for you now so with every appointment it makes me wonder what could they find, is this the visit.  I question every choice I have made since my last appointment.  Also I am very hard on myself, so I always worry what the doctors or nurses think of me.
0.595200	The only thing that could make me anxious is the feeling of uncertainty, when things aren't plain and sure I feel uneasy. Usually the results good or bad donât scare me but the lack of feedback and information does. Sure as a normal human you should be worried if your health isn't looking good but I usually keep things under control so as far as I can control my health is in a good standard which is why uncertainty would make me anxious, as for 'bad' results all you can do is follow the protocol and recover as best as possible.
0.714300	You never know what to expect the doctor to say. Especially if you aren't going on a regular basis then you will never know what to expect from the doctor. example waiting on blood work to process can be the most dreadful expereince as it leads to the patient waiting a day or two before results are complied. the anxious stage of mind comes into play when you are a student in school and waiting the teacher to tell you what grade you may have. This is the same factor that applies to the doctors room when you are always waiting on results..

The suspense of waiting for the results of and exam make me anxious.
0.714300	I am not comfortable getting naked in front of man I do not know.  I do not think that healthcare providers give a patient enough information about what they will be doing BEFORE they do it which makes me very jumpy.  I do not get in another person's personal space without permission or without telling them what I am doing.  I don't think it's too much to ask of virtual strangers especially when I am already naked and vulnerable.  I worry about what tests I will be told I need as many of them are painful or at least uncomfortable especially when someone has an issue with the sight of needles.  I worry about being diagnosed with a condition that could mean significant lifestyle changes or death.
0.142900	Generally the only time I am anxious is if I am taking a blood test or other test regarding Cholesterol, blood pressure etc to make sure I am in normal zones and taking care of myself. 
0.714300	The things that make me feel most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is that they will not make the proper diagnosis and that they will not give me a good enough medication for my ailments.  How could a doctor properly diagnose everything after such quick examinations?  Also, doctors are now so worried about being sued that they will not prescribe medications with addiction potential.  These drugs have worked well for a century and now we must use inferior drugs just because some people decide to abuse the drugs.

0.285700	If I am going to worry about attending a doctors visit, the thing that would make me the most nervous is not meeting or following through with their instructions.   Then having to face them, and explain why I didn't meet their goal or follow their advice.
0.714300	I think the internet is a big contributing factor to me feeling anxious, because I often go online to research symptoms and of course I think the worse. More than likely if is never what I worry about. The other worry of course is what the cost of things will be.
0.642900	Because he doesn't have a good bedside manner. I've only been seeing him for 2 years when my other doctor retired. I was hoping this doctor would recommend me seeing a nutritionist, but I didn't speak up about it this time. I don't really want to start searching for a new doctor, either. Guess I have to live with it.
0.714300	I have a reoccurring hernia and I am afraid she will see it and tell me I need to have surgery again. Also I am afraid when my blood pressure goes up or my cholesterol. 
0.595200	The main thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor is the fact that I have to sit right next to other people that have things that may or may not be worse than what I already have. A little more space between chairs would be sufficient in my opinion. I'm also anxious when they check for other things than what I came in for .
0.285700	What I feel most anxious or worried about when visiting the doctor's office is probably the wait of the actual appointment. I could not get into the doctor for a month with a condition that had me worried it was something serious. Unfortunately, the doctor was booked up and then when the appointment came, the doctor was with another patient for a little longer than scheduled so I appreciate her being with someone else and helping them but the waiting game was making me anxious.

0.285700	"When visiting a doctor's office, the thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is the wait between the time that I check in and the time the doctor actually can see me and uncertainty regarding how much the visit is going to cost financially. Primarily the anxiety I feel is induced by whatever ailment I am experiencing and it typically turns into both anxiety and relief....anxiety over what the doctor might diagnose (for instance, it could be the worst case scenario...though likely not) and relief knowing that someone will be able to give his/her professional opinion and action can be taken. However, for the most part, going to the doctor's office isn't anxiety inducing....just whatever symptoms I am experiencing and the possible cost to ""fix"" it. On a side note, I typically don't go to the doctor unless I am extremely concerned about whatever is ailing my body. "

0.238100	Probably just wondering how much it's going to cost. Everyone knows that doctors don't traditionally communicate prices before anything is said and done. Plus you pay a copay as soon as you walk in so you're kind of locked into being there anyway. I also start to worry that whatever I'm visiting for doesn't become a senseless come back again tomorrow or in 3 days so I can charge you for some more arbitrary services.

0.380952	Before USANA, there was Gull Laboratories. Dr. Wentz spent 20 years developing medical diagnostic test kits designed to detect infections and certain autoimmune disorders. In his experience, Dr. Wentz led to a heightened awareness of the importance of optimal nutrition in maintaining the health of human cells. This awareness, and the clear lack of advanced nutritional support in the market led to the sale of Gull Laboratories and the beginning of a new organization. In 1992, USANA was born. USANA offers its products to customers through a process called direct selling. Direct selling is a little different from what youâre probably used to seeing. Instead of selling our products at the grocery store, products are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers. You may ask why our business is set up this way, and the answer is centered on opportunity. USANA has always been about more than simply selling the best wellness products in the world to great peopleâwe wanted to give people the best opportunity to make their life the most successful it can be. Meaning we want people to be happy and healthy physically as well as financially. We use direct selling with the intention to help people get what they really want: freedom. Freedom to do what they want and when they want. The direct selling opportunity may not be for everyone on this planet, and thatâs OK. It doesnât need to be. We donât profess to have a quick âget richâ plan, or to have the âonly wayâ to earn a living. But we do claim the ability to give people another option to build wealth and establish financial stability, especially when they already love our product and are seeing great results. Itâs an opportunity for those looking to build their own business, but maybe wary of doing it all alone. Learn more about how to become an Associate or Preferred Customer of USANA here.

It has been five years and I have not had a pap smear.  They say because of my age that they do not need to do that, but I am still sexually active.  So therefore, it should be done.

I literally feel sick just thinking about going to the doctor!

0.333333	I feel that most of the anxiety I experience at a doctor's visit has to do with my remembering to relay all pertinent information and to ask all questions (especially since I tend to forget an important question fairly often).

I actually had shingles and a broke fibula at the same time. The stress o my leg caused the shingles.
0.142857	Finding out something that is totally unexpected. If I'm going in for pain in my ankle, I'm expecting some good/bad news regarding my ankle.  If I'm just going in for a simple biometric screening and leave being told I'm Hep-C or Diabetic, etc .

Thanks be to God, it has recently been decided (and the doc concurs) that, absent specific symptoms, those my age and older can skip ""routine"" colonoscopy due to cost-benefit evaluation and in light of the difficult/increasing physical burden posed on the aging by rigorous draining preparation.

0.500000	I worry that something might be wrong with me that would be a long term sickeness and I also don't like my weight
0.214286	If I think that something is wrong and I might get a not so good diagnosis or like the treatment option that the doctor is recommending, because of the negative side effects; then I have to weigh the risks of treating the problem verses not taking the treatment and possibly making the condition worst, also if there is going to be a problem with the insurance company covering the treatment or if I will have a very high out of pocket expense and then have to figure out how to pay for treatment/medication I may really need for a particular condition.
0.357143	The only I feel that way is if I am having a medical problem that I myself cannot figure out what it is,
0.619048	I'm afraid he may discover a life threatening illness and I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to handle the illness.
0.523810	I am anxious waiting for the doctor, I am anxious when he asks me questions and I am anxious awaiting his thoughts or feelings as to what is going on.
0.190476	Getting on the scale and seeing how much weight I have gained since my last office visit is worrisome 
0.333333	When I have to wait a long time in the waiting and in the exam room. If the front desk is unpleasant and not approachable. Or when the Dr. Leaves the exam room and takes a long time to come back.
0.809524	I get anxious when I see my doctor because I don't know what could happen usually when someone I knows go to the doctors they tend to get bad news each an everytime and I don't like that its not kool 
0.309524	Since I was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago, there is always some trepidation when going to the doctor: Am I all right? Has the cancer come back?  I regard these as legitimate concerns.
0.547619	I get anxious I don't have enough time for all my questions/concerns and usually blurt them out to quickly even though I have written them down.
0.380952	only if a serious problem might be existing and I'd have to have drastic action done, like surgery. or a chance of cancer perhaps.
0.285714	The cost and time needed to invest in visiting the doctor. Plus, the un-needed tests and procedures that doctors often order for their patient. 
0.142857	As a diabetic I'm always concerned about the A1C level and that I'm doing the right things. Every day is hard with knowing what, when, and how much to eat. It's a constant struggle. And even when you're doing everything right, sometimes your body does its own thing. I don't want my diabetes to get worse.
0.523810	I worry most about my blood test results, how to deal with my multiple conditions, and now much time I will be given to discuss my problems and questions.
0.761905	i only go to the doctor when absolutely necessary, and i am always nervous about what they are going to tell me. i am uninsured, so i don't have the money to go in the first place, much less pay for any tests or follow-ups they may want. at times i feel as though it would be better to not do anything and die because then, at least my family will not be stuck with outrageous bills they cannot afford
0.261905	i either forget my list of questions or suggestions, so i worry about that, like i am going to have to wait another 3 months to ask her. what kind of mood she is going to be in. i worry that i get a little afraid to talk to her or ask a question or tell her what new is going on or not going on and he just blows it off
0.404762	I do not like waiting in the waiting room.  I feel like the doctor will always try to give me medication i don't need.
0.380952	MY BIGGEST FEAR IS MY WEIGHT. I ALWAYS SAY I WILL LOSE BEFORE MY NEXT APPOINTMENT, BUT I SELDOM DO. I KNOW THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO HER, SO IT BECOMES A WORRY TO ME ALSO. I HAVE ANXIETY SO I ALWAYS WORRY MY APPOINTMENT WILL BE DELAYED, BUT SHE IS USUALLY ON TIME WHICH I APPRECIIATE
0.619048	Will I actually get something resolved that I am being seen for or will I need to be seen multiple times.
0.476190	I just don't like to go. I think nurses are worse about it. I dread it because I've been so sick and it brings back  bad memories.
0.333333	The thought of finding out something I didnt want to. Like having to be told I have a health risk or a disease of some sort.
0.500000	The reason that I get nervous when visiting the doctor's office is because I always think that the worst possible outcome will happen to me. 
0.500000	That when I tell them something that they will not believe me and not take me serious or do what I ask them or think that I am just asking for drugs when I am not I am asking for something to help with the pain
0.571429	Given the wrong diagnosis a few times. I have had 5 new PC in he past 7 years. That is very discouraging.
0.595238	There's really nothing that makes me feel anxious when I visited the doctor. My doctor always try to make me feel at easy when there's some bad news.
0.714286	I am always afraid that they are going to find something very serious or something that needs a lot of medical attention and I have no health insurance.
0.380952	not sure what the outcome will be. I worry that it might be something serious and that makes me feel worried
0.214286	The only thing I dread is the feeling of not being heard, AGAIN, and so I only go to the doctor when required for ongoing check-ups to refill life long prescriptions.
0.547619	that they aren't listening to me or that they dont care about me as a person.  I get worried that they might tell me something bad  
0.214286	The cost because I am not insured. That is my biggest concern. Other than that I feel that I am seeing a doctor for a reason.
0.142857	i would only feel anxious or worried if i went to an appointment with a pain or illness and was unsure about it
0.238095	it is the whole  getting undressed and having a stranger look at your hoo ha. I do not get respect and the doctors do not listen
0.285714	nothing makes me anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, I feel safe because i know I'm with someone that will work towards my well being 
0.142857	I can't answer this question because I do not get anxious when I visit my doctor. If I had to give an answer it would be the wait to see the doctor
0.571429	I never do, I have lots of confidence in her ! The only thing I worry about if something's wrong with me !!! 
0.523810	Just going to doctor of any kind makes me worried and anxious because I  dread going to any doctor. Just thinking about going causes those feelings
0.619048	I know you lying. The only one of the day of the day of school and college. I was just aBout to text you. You can be used to be a good girl . She said she was going through the process of getting numbers of the day of the time
0.500000	what the answer to my illness will be and how I would have to deal with  taking care of the issue and if there are any long term issues
0.714286	not knowing how it will turn out. Unknown tests, drugs, reactions, news. I don't like having my blood taken, shots, or upsetting news (obviously). 
0.309524	I feel  worried because maybe there is something wrong with me.  Maybe I did something that wasn't right.
0.333333	That they might find something wrong that I didn't expect. That they would prescribe a drug for me that I didn't want to take.
0.166667	I really don't have any minor or major medical problems, so I never really feel anxious or worried at all.  I'm 43 and rather healthy, so really not worrying about anything quite yet.
0.333333	That he spends so much time looking for things wrong with me and after so much work to show something might be wrong, then I find out everything is fine, so I worried for nothing.
0.285714	Mostly I feel knowing the final determination makes me the most anxious.  I also don't like to feel like something is being overlooked. 
0.642857	well i have anxiety and panic disorder so being away from home makes me really nervous and scared i dont like being that far from home 
0.571429	That the doctor might find something wrong that is serious and might take me away from my regular life.
0.309524	That something will be found that I hadn't expected.  You never know what blood work may find.  I also hate needles, i.e flu shot.
0.738095	Thinking that the doctor's going to do things that make my life difficult, and he'll bully me if I try to stick up for myself. I've had doctors tease me, tell me that I should purchase life insurance (I was in college at the time and NOT a fan of risky behavior), the works. 
0.690476	I'm worried they will find something worse than the problem I went in for. You go in thinking something may be fixed with medication then could find out it's really a life altering condition.
0.214286	Because i am not used to doing health esams very often, among other things of minor importance..........
0.404762	I am often afraid that a doctor will not take me seriously. I have had experiences where doctors ignore my input and disregard my feelings.
0.357143	I suffer from an anxiety disorder, as well as depression.  I dread appointments with my doctor because they make me fell anxious.  In addition, I have social anxiety.  
0.142857	the only think that makes me feel that way is physical check ups and also if i have to wait awhile to get into the doctor, i hate waiting in the room for an hour.
0.452381	The news i may get of something not being normal after was collected for further testing i think would be worry some 
0.547619	Get your tickets now that I'm a big hug can you please follow me please I love you so much for the first one to be a long time no see you tomorrow 
0.571429	getting on the scale, I hate to gain any weight  then next is my blood draw, I don't have very good veins
0.666667	I am worried or anxious as to what they might find and that they will tell me that I need to lose weight
0.642857	The unknown. Basically not knowing beforehand what the outcome of the visit might be. Also I worry if there are any changes in office staff who I don't know, due to the fact I am not all that confident if the new staff can be discreet.
0.142857	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctor for any reason, be it acute or chronic care.                                           
0.142857	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office. But I may be come nervous when I go to the Dentist.
0.690476	I GET IN MY FEELINGS BECAUSE HE JUST DOESN'T ACT LIKE HE CARES. I AM JUST $ IN HIS EYES. HE DOESN'T FULLY EXAMINE ME OR TALK ABOUT BLOOD RESULTS OR ANYTHING. I DON'T ENJOY GOING AT ALL !
0.142857	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.  I have no problem going into the office.
0.452381	I think I'm more anxious about not finding the cause for my pain or injury.  There is nothing more discouraging than being shuffled between doctors who say there us nothing wrong with you based on their specialty and sending you to the next doctor.  In the meantime, the condition worsens, and you can either become so discouraged that  you give up going to the doctor and try to self medicate, or you lie and say you're cured.  
0.190476	I don't know what my test results will be when I get a check up at the doctor's office. I feel uneasy about this.
0.738095	I feel anxious and/or worried when I'm visiting the doctors office because I'm not sure what the doctor is going to say. 
0.404762	I JUST FUCKING TOLD YOU THAT I DO NOT FEEL ANXIOUS THIS SURVEY IS FUCKING JOKE ASD FAGH JKLQWERTYUI OP
0.523810	To know about how my health by asking is the medications working how long do i have to take my medications i learned i have liver disease and i might need a transplant seeing a specialist and getting the test i need to help me through this 
0.476190	i guess the thing that tends to make me the most anxious when it comes to doctors and doctor's offices overall is the whole unknown aspects of things. not knowing what to expect tends to make me uneasy
0.619048	Mostly what procedures are going to be done.  Not knowing what to expect in the examination and if it is just a look over and if the doctor sends you somewhere else..
0.595238	That they will find something serious like cancer. It runs in my family so it's always on my mind at a checkup
0.142857	I rarely feel worried when at the doctors mostly just nervous from being out of comfort zone mostly just a not liking being in a hospital or dentist office or doctor office. 
0.595238	When the doctor wants to run more tests. I am also anxious waiting for test results. I am more anxious than worried. 
0.142857	Nothing has ever made me feel anxious or worried when meeting with my family doctor. He is always outgoing friendly and tells you the straight truth of what is going on.
0.357143	I have some health issues so each time I go to the doctor I worry what could be wrong this time or what tests are necessary AND how much it will cost me.
0.595238	I am not sure what he is telling me is the truth about my health. Doctors may sometimes tell you the wrong thing about your body because he does not examine you but ask you questions that may not have anything to do with your condition.
0.666667	diagnosing me with problems i don't have. giving me the wrong drugs to take. having really bad side effects from the pill im taking
0.309524	because I just am an anxious person in general - so this just how I feel sometimes during the day.  Since I am getting older and things are just breaking down, I want to be sure that over all I am still as healthy as I can be.
0.476190	finding out I have a seruiuos problem that I am not fully aware of. Certain pains may be a sign of something serious that only a doctor can diagnose
0.595238	Not noing the outcome of a test the waiting on outcome of it hopeing the outcome is not bad that it lest than that that all.
0.619048	Will I hear  bad news again or will I need more tests scares me. I've had open heart surgery and don't want to go thru that again...6 weeks in hospital.
0.214286	I am sometimes worried that I can't convey my issues well enough. I'm also cognisant of other people waiting, so I don't want to take too much time. 
0.571429	I hate to get weighed at the doctors office. I am uncomfortable with wIting in the exam room also. I get a little nervous and sometimes forget to ask what I want to ask.
0.404762	i guess like everyone going to the doctor makes me a little nervous and unsure about what the visit might bring. you always hope for the best but have in the back of your mind about what a diagnosis might be. 
0.595238	I want everything to go well and most healthy well people are not at the doctor.  Just want to get a good report

0.547619	I have several several chronic conditions, so I'm worried that there could be a problem with one of me conditions or a reaction from a current illness.
0.809524	when they do see you its in and out . they don't really evaulate you like they should. and sometimes they get pretty mean and rude with me as well and i don't like it when they are like that
0.166667	I feel anxious if I have to have blood drawn, or a shot. I don't like needles. Otherwise, I am rarely nervous.
0.261905	Because I want to get it done, so it dosent conflict with my schedule. So i can get get done quickly. In and out.
0.809524	When I have a gut feeling that something is wrong. I try to do as much research about what I think is wrong before seeing my doctor so I know what to ask and that makes me anxious.
0.714286	Their attitude when they tell you to undress. Like it's touchy,touchy, feely time. Even when you tell them somethings not there they still want to touch. 
0.142857	Four years ago I was found to have Afib.  So since then I am more concerned about the cost of meds; their possible side effects; and having tests done.  I have had a cardioversion done 2 times and the afib has come back and because of the pain afterwards (it does not hurt at the time because you're given anesthesia) I do not want to have it done again.  
0.666667	I get worried about what he is going to say and i feel embarrased about my problems but would be more comfortable with a female doctor.
0.142857	The most anxious part of my Drs visits is getting weighed since I have a weight problem. I never want to weigh more then I did on my last visit.
0.238095	sometimes I might be nervous if when they are doing tests if my numbers or info is not good and they might suggest more meds
0.666667	worried of what might be found, embarrassed if undressing is required for the exam. getting on the weight scale is always not the same as my home scale.
0.571429	I don't feel anxious more annoyed. I feel like I end up wasting my time and get little results. I feel like I have to keep going back and wasting more money.
0.404762	What is my lab work going to show?  Is my thyroid concdition going to be better or worse.  If worse, what is he going to suggest?  How am I going to get to consider that all of my immune disorders are related to my MS diagnosis of many years ago which he thinks is totally gone?
0.571429	When is was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had to make a decision on the best treatment plan for me.  I relied on my primary care physician to talk with me about all options.
0.642857	certain parts of the exam are invasive and uncomfortable. it is a cold and sterile environment. i  do not like being poked and prodded
0.357143	The bill makes me the most worried. Not only the cost of the office visit, but the deductible I have to pay as well. This is why most times, I opt out of seeing the doctor, so I don't receive a bill.
0.476190	I think that having to wait is worrying. It is just not knowing what is going to happen next that makes me anxious.
0.761905	My family has had a lot of serious diseases and health issues.  I have had cancer.  I have learned it can certainly happen to you. Lost a lot of family at a young age.
0.142857	I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor.  I have a lot of faith in him and I am not a bit anxious or worried.
0.142857	Nothing, I feel comfortable with them.  They know what they're doing so there is nothing to worry about 
0.357143	It's a plain quiet and sterile atmosphere.  The decor isn't too relaxing to be waiting in. I always fear a routine checkup will end with bad news
0.190476	I have several health problems.  I am anxious that things might  not be going as smoothly as I think they are.
0.666667	I really hate shots or invasive procedures (*i.e pap smears) I also hate not knowing what to expect as far what will happen during the visit. This worry always goes away as soon as the actual doctor has arrived. I think it is the waiting that gets me most nervous. 
0.738095	I am worried that I will not ask everything I need to ask or will miss something she is trying to tell me.  I do not like to be touched.
0.571429	I never feel that way with my doctor.  He makes me feel comfortable and he is easy to talk to.  I am pretty healthy, so no reason to worry.
0.285714	Only the thoughts of what lies ahead. What will they discover, and what are the problems. The unknown when I see concern by the doctor.
0.142857	I can honestly say that I never feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office.  I choose a doctor that I have confidence and trust in completely.
0.309524	I have a family history of cancer so when I have blood work done I am always a little bit worried that they are going to show something. Even if I have no other symptoms of anything being wrong and I am only in for my yearly physical for work I can't help worry about what the blood work might say. 
0.761905	I am a breast cancer survivor with circulation problems so I am anxious when I need to have office visits
0.571429	When the doctor's abrupt and seems distracted, I start to worry. When (S)he's not very communificate, asks few questions and needs to be prodded, that's worse. 
0.928571	I am afraid of being diagnosed with a serious illness, my blood pressure is usually up when being examined.
0.857143	I feel fearful and anxious when I go to doctors office over the test results I have to wait for after a two week period. I sometimes think the worst.

0.142857	I am always concerned that my tests will show something or that I have a condition that can not be treated.
0.333333	the wait time is too long and the cost is way too high and they only see you for a minute and never listen to you
0.238095	I feel anxious and worried because I know I have not  accomplished the goal he has set for me. I feel like I am going to get in trouble like going to the principals office. 
0.523810	It not always a lot of fun going to the doctor depending on why you are going, and sometimes it makes me a bit anxious or nervous. It just is not a fun place to be

0.571429	Your premise is correct.  I do not fell anxious.  I do not feel worried.  I s view doctor as my partner.
0.619048	The doctor discovering something bad or wrong with me. That makes me anxious or scared, about what will happen next.

0.571429	I have  no fears  when I  go to my doctor  for  any  appointment    procedures. I have  complete  confidence in my  family  doctor
0.571429	Im afraid what the doctor will find and what they wont find making a worse health condition then what i originally went in for
0.333333	Not knowing the results of lab tests or any other kind of test.  The wait for the results makes me anxious
0.190476	I worry about a lot of things but some are not able to fix or do anything about the doctor does what he can
0.619048	First of all,I have no insurance because I can't afford it.I know since I've gotten older,more things are going on with my body,I hurt worse,very tired,etc.But,I can't afford to have tests,etc ran.
0.809524	I worry he/she won't believe anything I say nor takes the time needed to diagnose a condition or illness I may have
0.690476	it goes like the old saying , if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I don't look forward to anyone trying to find something wrong with me
0.476190	I am always wondering if she is going to find something wrong that I had no idea existed and I always worry that my high blood pressure is not going to be as low as it normally is at home.
0.333333	Visiting a doctor is just uneasy  feeling. You are  usually  in a flimsy gown and sitting on a hard table. It is just an unnatural  setting 
0.476190	I feel anxious not knowing if the doctor will do a good job and be completely honest or not.  I also feel anxious not knowing if they will find something wrong with me.  And, I also feel anxious about how much things will cost.
0.547619	I hate being hospitalized. I am worried they might find something that will require me to go back into the hospital. There I stay thirsty and can get no rest.
0.714286	That my lab numbers will be bad, that I will have gained instead of lost weight, that my PCP will find yet something else wrong with me. 
0.142857	"I often wonder if they are going to be on time with my appointment, will they make me feel ""rushed"" and uncomfortable about asking questions and wanting more answers, will my appointment get cancelled due to an emergency."

0.142857	i have trust in my doctor so i dont have to worry plus i pray and know i am in God hands. Jesus is always with us
0.619048	Just about the procedure and if it will hurt or not. That causes a little anxiety. It has nothing to do with the doctor
0.404762	I only worry when I leave the doctor's office if I am waiting on test results or have left with more questions .
0.595238	What makes me most anxious or worried is that I don't know if something terrible is wrong or not. Or if I'm getting a shot or something I sorta dont like it
0.476190	It worries me that my doctor or PA may find cancer or so other illness or disease . I have no medical background as I am adopted, so I have nothing to watch for. It is very worrisome that some type of cancer or major illness may be found.
0.238095	Everyone that visits a doctor get anxious or worried, if you don't, something is wrong with you.  Anxious, because I want to be taken at my time of appointment, not 30 min. later.  Worried that she might find or see something that she hasn't seen or heard before, that is natural
0.428571	I am doing fine, relax, calm, nothing to worry about anything and just ignore it. I am very healthy and nothing wrong with me. 
0.571429	There really isn't anything that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office I ussually psyc myself up before my appointment.
0.452381	Follow up times make me anxious the most, as I am concerned that I haven't followed through they way the specialist has asked.  Concerned I didn't loose enough weight to meet their ideals between visits, even though most times my GP doesn't push too hard about it, and often I have lost, especially this year.  If the doctor's office calls me in my mind naturally goes to the bad news side of thinking.
0.285714	I don't like visiting the doctor on general principles but my condition has been fairly stable the last couple of years.  If she suddenly suggested more surgery I would be very upset and nervous.  I had 2 open heart surgeries in less than a year and I don't want to go through that again.
0.595238	I am not at all worried I go in their and get the information and go on my way. As I can look on my portal to see what I need.
0.547619	Given the nature that I see him, sometimes it can be hard when waiting for test results. It can be hard between after the tests and before I see him to get the results. Concerned if things have changed and if so for better or worse 
0.809524	Well, no one wants to die and sometimes we have to face that when visiting the doctor's office. If something is wrong, then you have to start thinking.
0.190476	waiting to be seen and how long i will have to wait to actually see the doctor and waiting for results

0.809524	I feel anxious because I don't like going to the doctor anyway and I don't like to receive ad news. I hate this because even though I may be in good health that doesn't mesn anything. It just scares me even though nothing is probably wrong with me.
0.880952	I always feel worried and anxious when visiting a doctors office because I have a fear of doctors hurting me since I was little, I have never been comfortable because when I was little my doctor would have to check my private parts and I didn't like being touched there by someone I only saw once in a while and didn't have a trusted relationship with and he would often call me fat so it made me even more uncomfortable which carried on to my adult life even though I switched doctors, my experience with my first doctor still stuck with me. I have also had doctors spring stuff on me like I was going in for a flu shot and my doctor would suddenly say I was getting a Pap smear done too. I need time to mentally prepare myself when I go to the doctors.

0.285714	I feel anxious and worried that I will be given news that I am seriously not well and may need surgery.
0.547619	The only time I feel this way is when I am not sure what is wrong with me or just want to make sure everything is right when I go for my diagnosis. 
0.428571	Well you never know what will happen. You can feel fine but tests show that you are not. Who knows.
0.547619	Even if you feel perfectly fine, you never know what could come up during an examination. And the longer the wait, the worse things can get in that regard.
0.452381	WHEN THE DOCTOR CONTACTS ME AND ASKED ME TO COME IN UNEXPECTEDLY; OR REFUSES TO GIVE ME INFORMATION ABOUT AN ISSUE OVER THE PHONE AND INSIST THAT I COME IN
0.833333	Not being able to afford the cost of the visit. I worry about being harassed about payment in the future.

0.500000	The doctor speaks in a tone that is always uncertain and could lead to something worse. I'm usually not anxious thought 
0.690476	What makes me feel anxious or worried in a doctor's office is that first of all I have to take off my clothing and be examined by someone of the opposite sex and you just don't know what's really going on with you and so you're anxious to know and a little bit worried as well.

0.738095	I have had many physical problems in the passed and I am always afraid that they will find something new. 
0.523810	The generalized anxiety feeling that something might be wrong with me. I always think they're going to tell me bad news, or that my health is not as good as it should be. I already have bad anxiety as it is so when I go to the Doctor for my anxiety specifically I am scared my condition has gotten worse or that they will physically find something wrong with me. I think everyone gets a little uneasy when going to the Doctor because it represents sickness and illness. 
0.619048	That I mY receive some type of bad news in I may not be about to handle it in it will worry my family alot

0.333333	When I haven't been able to see my doctor for 5 or more years because I did not have health care or could not afford basic health insurance I become fearful that he may find something wrong with my health because it's been so long since I last saw a doctor.
