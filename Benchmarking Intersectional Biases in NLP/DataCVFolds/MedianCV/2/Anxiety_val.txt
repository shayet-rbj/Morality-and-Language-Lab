-1	I always visit top-notch medical centers. Some doctors work very long shifts. Hence, I can become worried when a doctors appears to be very tired.
1	Obviously, that something is wrong. That you've gone in for something routine and there may be more going on than what you were prepared for. For example, going in for something that you thought was a swollen lymph node and being apprehensive that it could be cancer. I think about these sorts of things when I have an appointment. 
-1	Knowing that you will likely find out what is wrong with you and hoping that it's not something expensive or bad. Also, hoping you get worthwhile information out of going in relation to the cost of going. Or the possibility of having to feel pain from procedures.
-1	The lighting in most of the doctor's offices seem to mess with my anxiety. I don't care to sit in those rooms waiting on the doctor. Depending what I am going for I may get nervous of the results. 
-1	nothing unless I have pains in my body which I can't explain. then, my doctor will have to find out the causes and future remedies.
-1	The only things I've every worried about when visiting a doctor are if it's a new doctor and whether or not I'm going to like them, if I see a lot of people in the waiting room and feel like it's going to be a very long appointment that is going to take up a lot of time and ruin my day, or if I feel like they are going to tell me I have some type of more serious health issue going on. I have had some doctors make me feel anxious in the past, but my main doctor has never caused me to feel that way. 
1	It's not just visiting the doctor's office that makes me feel most anxious or worried I'm always anxious and worried.
-1	If I go see a doctor then I have a medical concern. My anxiety is hoping that whatever I am going to be seen about is minor or will have a positive outcome 
1	depending on the situation i worry about a scary diagnosis, or if it is a checkup i worry they will find something wrong with me, even if i felt fine. i worry about being shocked that i have something wrong.
-1	If I am in pain or sick I worry about what he or she will find. If it is just going in for a check up I really don't worry to much.
-1	nothing really just the quiet setting 
-1	My weigh I am to big and I know it. My doctor doesn't fuss at me but he tells me I need to loose weigh
1	Finding out some kind of terrible news. Chronic disease. Expensive procedures are also a big fear. It's not a big issue because I stay healthy
-1	When I am going in with something that I dont know about and how it will turn out. I mostly go for my annual physicals. I never have ailments. So if I ever had an ailment and had to go in I would be very anxious.
-1	That I will receive bad news - whether that is pregncy or a medical condition I didn't expect.
1	Fear of the unknown. Waiting for a diagnosis. Waiting for test results when I have a new ailment, not just routine yearly tests.
-1	Mostly I feel knowing the final determination makes me the most anxious.  I also don't like to feel like something is being overlooked. 
1	I am always afraid now that the Doctor will mess up and diagnose wrong and cost me or my family our lives. 
-1	nothing really. it is what it is nothing to be concerned about. 
1	The hope that nothing bad comes out of the exam.  I go to an exam if I think something might need to be checked, or for bloodwork ect.  Its always a worry that something will maybe be wrong.  
-1	The thought of them saying something negative or harmful. Also I might be worried about a outcome of a procedure or test.
1	I sometimes get anxios about what he will say or what he will find and if he has something to say about my weight or health in general.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I've been there enough times that most visits are routine and anything major can be dealt with during the visit or by a referral to another doctor.
-1	People has to belive the doctor and sometime. They be wrong they only care about the money not the person they put you on pill that all of them has bad side affets
-1	I always get a little worried something will be wrong. My health is very important to me so I get anxious about it.
1	The feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is often because of the very long waiting time to be seen. 
1	What might come of the visit. Not seeing my doctor, just what may or may not be wrong.
1	I have what is known as a fear of needles.  Not too excited to be at a Dr's office.  I have had to go to so many because of my allergies and asthma.  Always glad when the appointment is over. 
-1	i feel anxious when im sick and something is wrong i get upset because of the waiting on the test result to come
1	I am old enough to know the probability for health and longevity, and also old enough to have experienced times when things did not work out the way we hope that they would. What makes me feel anxious is that the older I get the more likely I will be told that I am going to die by a doctor based merely on probabilities.
-1	I feel like he might find something that I didn't spot. I get nervous thinking that there is something wrong with me, and I'll have to have surgery. 
1	because you are afraid if they are going to find something wrong with you you feel good but they might find underlying things,   i mean they are the doctor
-1	I am very comfortable in doctor's offices and in hospital surroundings. I grew up in that environment because my mom worked at a hospital, and so I was always there and the other doctors were friendly and doting toward me. So, I am never anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office unless I fear or expect something is very wrong with me.
1	That they will try to give me a shot....I HATE needles. Or that they will tell me something is wrong with me. 
1	I worry that my doctor is basing her opinion on guessing and not proof I know I need to find another doctor
1	The whole thing is anxiety producing and nerve-wracking. One of the primary contributors to these negative feelings involves my persol knowledge of how physicians frequently behave, think, and act i.e. their utter lack of genuine care or concern for patients, their tendency to essentially ignore patients and just drone on about whatever they would like to, and their tendency to behave like patients are a burden and infringing on their time. 
1	Worried nervous
1	That she not listen to what i have to say. And that she just wants me to go to this doctor to that doctor. 
-1	
-1	I don't get anxious about visiting the doctor in the same way that I don't get anxious when shopping for groceries or getting an oil change.
1	Not knowing if something may actually be wrong with my health
-1	The terrorists attacks and all the biogen the crimes ghats going across the world and the United States
-1	I do not typically get worried when going to the Dr. Unless it is going to be a painful procedure.
1	The obvious you have cancer your dieing of a disease I've had a very dramatic childhood and the memories are always on my mind as well as alot of bad feelings over the years 
-1	I'm more anxious to see if the thoughts I have on what the issue are line up to his. If they do then I already kind of know the course of treatment so there is no mystery.
-1	Whenever I have an issue i'm worried that it is actually bigger than I expected. The hospital setting sort of makes it worse.
-1	I feel the most anxious when I have a test and I am waiting for the results. I also feel anxious when I am in a lot of pain and I do not know why. 
-1	The news I am going to get back if I'm having an issue, getting blood drawn or getting stuck with needles, plus being around sick people
1	The unknown always tends to make me feel anxious or worried.  We all look forward to good news, however when it is unforeseen, it leads to your thoughts running wild.  
-1	I worry that there could be something more wrong with many than there really is.
1	I feel anxious sometimes the not knowing what the results of the test could be and if there is any change from the last time
1	I often worry that they will discover something is wrong with me.  I also worry about how much the doctor's visit will cost and whether or not I will be able to afford by bill when I check out.  In general, visiting the doctor gives me high anxiety.
1	Because I never know what the conclusion is of what is wrong with my health. Plus I don't know whether the doctor will be nice or not
1	Because I either wants it to be over with. Or am worried about the outcome. Because these can be really bad 
-1	Concern about what they might find that is wrong with me, and concern that the doctor may not be able to do anything about what is wrong.
-1	What makes me anxious and worried is that they do not listen to what I want or trying to do things a tural way. They just blindly follow protocol and make money for big pharma. Free healthcare is one thing but It would be so much better if we could afford decent rent and space to take care of our well being instead of expensive rent, small spaces and cheap food so that we are stressed and unhealthy. 
-1	I don't get anxious or worried going to my doctors for a physical checkup it's just a regular checkup that shouldn't be anything to worry about at all 
1	Just get anxious that they may find something wrong with me that will change my way of life. I also feel like there is a good likelihood of me getting sick from other sick people when i go to the doctor
1	That they might find something seriously wrong with me that I was not expecting.  Hoping everything is normal
1	I do not know what my current symptoms are, and how they effect the rest of my illnesses.  I dread going on new medicine.  I already take 9 presecriptions
-1	I am most worried or anxious when one of my kids are sick, we all see the same doctor. Even so, I still have confidence in my doctor's advice.
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor because sometimes i don't know what to expect. In my mind i think the doctor may end up finding something negative and not good and that makes me worried most of the time
1	Being given some negative information about my health that I had no awareness of.
-1	The time I have to wait in the office waiting to be seen and waiting on blood work to come back and waiting for them to come into room for my exam. 
1	i feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office in case that i should hear something i don't want to hear or hear bad news. 
1	My main worries are that my lab work would have shown something or that the doctor is dissatisfied with something in my health. My family has many health conditions that I am predisposed to that I also fear about showing eventually in my life.
-1	I'm never anxious or worried when I have a doctor's visit. I always go in calm and collective and I hardly ever have any problems.
1	I am just worried they will comment on something that will make me uncomfortable. I once had a Dr yell at me about my pulse rate but this was after the receptionist told me my insurance was canceled. I panicked but it was a clerical error on her part and was quickly fixed. My heart was racing and I hadnât fully calmed down yet. 
-1	taking routine examinations, such as colon cancer screening and waiting for the results. I worry when the doctor prescribes medication for me such as for enlarge prostate or high cholesterol, but he assures me it is just precautionary.
1	I get anxious about what medical conditions that the doctor might discover and the treatments that might be suggested.
1	I am always worried that the doctor's staff will completely screw up my appointment and/or referral information. It has happened numerous times.
1	I feel most anxious when the physicians ask me questions but then act as if they don't believe what I am telling them, whatever it may be.
1	Always  the fear they may find something serious wrong or may tell me something I do not want to hear  
-1	When I have a new symptom or symptoms knowing that my smoking is putting me at risk of developing cancer.
1	For some reason I'm always afraid that they won't believe me or will think that I'm weird. I get weird looks sometimes because of the way I explain situations due to my anxiety. The nurses are generally good at making this okay, but the actual doctors generally seem too busy with their shift to fully give you their time and attention. 
1	I am concerned that there is the possibility of another stroke in my future. I am currently taking meds that will hopefully prevent that but you never know.
-1	Most likely I feel anxiety in my own mind when visiting the doctor's office.  What with all you hear and read about today, you cannot help but feel the anxiety of the unknown.
-1	Drawing my blood when it is needed for lab work. I just do not like getting stuck with needles. I do not like the lab tech searching for a vein into which a needle may be inserted. I just plain do not like seeing a lab tech when I have had to be in a fasting state!
-1	i feel most anxious when they call you for follow up if something went wrong. im worried about found a medical condition that can kill you. 
-1	My health is pretty good so there isnât anything that I am really concerned about. I guess just getting my yearly physical. I hate getting that every year.
1	I do not enjoy waiting to be seen and all the little things that must be done (weight, temperature, blood pressure). 
-1	what makes me more anxious or worry is knowing if i'm good or if i'm gonna need take pills, have an illness that is hard to cure.
-1	I am not usually anxious in the doctor's office. I know that there is not anything wrong with me health wise, so I am always confident that I am in good shape. Occasionally I get anxious walking in, but that is it.
-1	It makes me most anxious when I call to get advice from the doctor, and it takes weeks to receive a response. If I don't proactively call them daily, I may not be given any information.
1	I worry they might find something really wrong with me that requires hospitalization. Or possibly some terminal disease, for which there is no cure.
-1	I Feel worried when i am very ill and there are several test being taken. I worry that i will not have money to cover the cost 
1	That some may actually be wrong with me and that the doctor may fine a serious illness that require life changing procedures 
1	Im embarassed about talking about my problem with the physician afraid he may judge me with his workers 
-1	How long I will be sitting there.
1	They're fairly sterile and I generally feel concerned about what possible medical problems I could have.
1	I am worried that they are going to tell me I have some huge problem and then judge me for it. Or that they may just say I do so they can make money. Or make me feel uncomfortable about myself. I am a very private person. The best case scenario is that I go in they say I have a clean bill of health and I just paid them for that. 
1	I don't know the person and I feel vulnerable. I don't like talking to stranger or having strangers touch me.
1	I have anxiety in going to the doctor. I feel that the doctor will try and diagnose me with something that I do not have. 
-1	I do not feel anxious with any doctor O go to. Either i will follow their suggestions or not. I only go to the doctor when i have to.
-1	The main thing I don't like going through is a breast exam and/or a pelvic exam. I would imagine both of those are slightly uncomfortable for almost all women. I know they have to be done though, so I manage to get through them whenever they are needed.
1	I don't like feeling vulnerable as someone exams me.  I don't like having to get undressed in a cold room or having someone judging me.  If I do go to the doctor, I normally have to have something seriously wrong so I am anxious to find out what the problem is.  
1	The possibility that they may find something wrong that could be serious. Maybe I could have missed something or it could be something that I don't know how to find. 
-1	I usually just worry that things are going to be worse than they actually are. Usually, it turns out to be the opposite, but still. The not know or that feeling that something might actually be really bad is what worries me the most. Sometimes things get in my head that I can't seem to shake off.
1	I simply hate being physically examined by a strange person. I also don't like being asked personal questions about my life and behavior, especially sexual behavior. I am worried that I will be considered strange or suspicious for not wanting to answer questions, so I prefer to avoid the situation.
1	I have heard doctors tell me nothing is wrong so many times, and it makes me feel powerless. When I see a new doctor, I am worried that this doctor is going to be like most of the doctors I've had before.
1	When I've read online about symptoms. I always expect the worst and then I worry that the Doctor will confirm what I read.
1	I have just always been uncomfortable about letting someone  look me over.  I know that it is sometimes necessary, but it kind of feels like an invasion.  That's just how I feel.
-1	I worry about getting a seriously negative diagnosis for a medical problem. I am anxious about general tests in the office -- blood pressure, breathing exam and test. Heart rate and ekg tests.
-1	If there will be a negative result and something bad will happen to me then I will become very worried when coming into the doctors office
-1	I'm not really usually very worried when visiting a doctor's office.  However there is always the back of the mind fear that they may discover or see something that is not what I came in for. Additionally, when I have blood tests I sometimes fear that they may discover something that is wrong that could be caused by cancer or some other major illness.
-1	finding out that I have a new medical condition that we can not treat or cure. Having to take more medication on top of what I already take. 
-1	Waiting for a result. There are times when you may not get a result back for a week or two, and you have to wait to see what is going to happen next. In that waiting time, you have to pick your head up and continue on, as hard as it may be. 
-1	i'm not usually worried when i go to the doctor. i'm a fairly healthy person and i can usually get a prescription to take care of anything that's going on. 
1	I feel anxious or worried that my doctor will find something else wrong with me. I'd rather not hear it or know about it, to be honest
-1	I think I am generally uncomfortable with visiting a doctor's office. I have never had a particularly bad experience at a doctor's office, but I find going to appointments to be an unpleasant but necessary thing to do. I am also a bit disturbed by having to share breathing space with other sick people in the waiting room, etc...
1	You just never know what the doctor might think or suggest or tell you. Fear of bad news. I think it's natural to feel this way.
-1	I just don't want anything to be wrong with me.  I have a husband and two little boys and worry somewhat that something major will be wrong that we won't be able to fix.
-1	I really am not sure. I have always felt a bit anxious or worried when going for exams. It doesn't really have anything to do with the doctor usually. 
1	I never know what to expect. I don't know if they will say my pressure is so high that I need to stay in the hospital.
1	The vaccine debate always gets me a bit nervous. Also, when trying to explain what is going on with me I do not always feel as if they are willing to help me find the proper treatment.
1	"I feel as if I will not get the answers that I want and need. I want to be told the truth and not have it ""sugar coated""."
1	What makes me feel the most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is the unknown. Generally, when I am going to the doctor's office, I don't know what is wrong with me and I fear the worst in some circumstances.
1	I'm always afraid that I will get bad news and it worries we every time I go to the Dr's office. I have a great doctor and he always lets me know what I need to do.
1	I feel anxious that I won't get the right diagnosis or that the doctor won't tell me preventative or natural methods to my health issues.  I don't just want a drug.  I want to know how to prevent my condition from getting worse and what natural steps I can take for my health before taking a drug.
-1	  Whenever, i go to the doctor, i know that, i am going to be diagnosed so the situation is a very uncomfortable for me because, i'm scared of the results of the test.
1	If somethings bothering me, my biggest concern is that the doctor won't really give it too much attention and that they'll just brush it off and maybe give me a prescription that won't really help that much. I worry that i'll have to live with something that's bothering me just based off the fact that a doctor wants to get on with his  day without putting much thought into my problems. 
-1	It's not as if I'm nervous or anxious every time, but you never know when you're going to get a disease
1	That they'll not take me seriously, or they won't listen to my concerns and dismiss my fears.  When I tell them how I'm feeling they'll just brush it off as if it's nothing.  Then I'll walk out feeling as awful as when I walked in with no light at the end of the tunnel.
-1	I am usually anxious or worried of having high cholesterol,high blood pressure or other potential illness that might occur before visiting the doctor's office.
1	When Im at the doctors and then they come in and look like they need to tell you something real important. 
1	First, the paper gown is a nightmare. Who doesn't feel anxious wearing only a bit of paper? My usual appointment is for an annual exam, so there's always anxiety about having potentially cold and uncomfortable metal objects put in my girl bits. And, of course, the fear that the doctor is going to find something horrible/fatal
1	I have not been anxious from going to a doctors office in a while.  Everything that I have been told in a while was what I was expecting.
-1	The only way I will be anxious during a doctor visit is when the physical feeling in my body is overwhelmingly uncomfortable.
-1	i feel anxious or worried what the outcome of the visit may be and if there will be anything serious to consider, the length of time to take care of it and the cost.
-1	I have white coat syndrome. My BP always runs higher in the doctor's office. I just don't care for the experience overall. Nothing really specific. 
-1	i hate needles, proceduresâ¦.it  makes me queasy just thinking about itâ¦i psych  myself up for once a year bloodworkâ¦.and i try not to act like 5 year old when i go for a check upâ¦..
1	That they will find something seriously wrong or that they will miss something important or not listen to what I have to say.
-1	Sometime the wait alone can be worrisome.  And if i am coming to grt some test results sometimes i feel a little uneasy hoping for the best outcome
-1	I only feel a little anxious because I don't want to get any negative test results or hear any bad news from the doctor.Otherwise,I have no problems going to the doctor.
-1	There was not a good check on my health instead I was asked a few questions and let go. I would have liked to be checked more.
1	I've been in such a stressful work environment that I have developed high blood pressure. I'm now anxious whenever doctors want to measure it.
-1	If I think iam having a baby, or if iam being checked for a STD other than that iam a clean person so I no that I don't have to worry about it
1	I always feel anxious when I have to wait for test results. I am also anxious when a doctor does not have a quick solution to my health problems.
-1	that I am responding positively to medications and show no additional medical issues and getting weighed
-1	I guess it's all the waiting. There is always at least a 10-15 minute wait in the office before the appointment. 5-10 would be more acceptable. Then there is also the time you have to wait in the examition room. 
1	I'm the most anxious when I have no clue what could be causing my problem or if the doctor or nurse doesn't seem to know either. Also I get anxious if I anticipate bad news.
1	I am the most anxious that the paper gowns will not fit me. As crazy as it seems I do not want to sit on a paper table in a paper gown. I hate that part. I would rather sit in a cloth gown! They never close and then the paper blanket is usually a joke as well. It is frustrating. I also hate giving blood and that process of waiting to be called to do that. I often say I would run away if I could then we laugh. I mean it though. I know it is necessary but those two things: gowns and blood are my issues.
-1	I dont like when people touch me.. and even though i know him, i dont know him on a personal level like that. plus the germs at the doctor really bother me. 
1	Just the fact that I'm going to or in a doctors' office gives me a sense of dread. It's not that I think something's wrong to something's going to happen, it's just that there is always the possibility. 
1	I have had medical issues in the past, I am scared they will return.I don't like going to he doctor for check ups, but do anyway. 
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is fear of the unknown. Sometimes I worry something might be seriously wrong with me.
1	I get nervous that the doctor will scrutinize my health. I do not want to here things that I know, like drinking less pop or eating less carbs etc. I also get worried they may find some serious health complication that will upend my life.
1	I only go to the office when something is bothering me, so I am worried about my condition at the time. I am bad about thinking the worse, so I tend to dwell on that until I see the doctor.
1	I said not to do this you know opinion outpost I can't do this anymore I just Im done 37)::&9@?::79@087;,!'  Gffhjkktf. Kkhfvnjb there's my characters happy?
1	Going to the doctor in general just makes me anxious in general. I feel like it is all in my head. I sometimes think of the scenarios that can go wrong.
-1	I just feel anxious sometimes that i may get bad news.  They may find cancer or something serious that i was not expecting that could be life changing.
1	I have social anxiety and any time I have to go to an office and talk about personal things it's very difficult for me.
1	i feel that way only because I feel Im only wasting my time. I go every 3 months and its the same thing.Meanwhile Im still in the same shape for 11 years now
-1	I would only visit a doctor if I was pretty sure there was something seriously wrong with me, so the higher source of stress would be whatever that is.
1	I ALWAYS KNOW THE ISSUE ABOUT MY WEIGHT IS GOING TO COME UP.  I HATE TALKING ABOUT IT.  I HAVE TRIED AND FAILED MANY TIMES TO LOSE WEIGHT.  I ALSO NOTICE MORE PAINS THAN USUAL AND WORRY KNOWING MY FAMILY HISTORY.
-1	Nothing.  I have no anxieties or worries when visiting my doctor or his office.  They are very thorough and efficient.
-1	I dont feel anxious at all when visiting my doctor nor do I feel disappointed because my doctor is very good at being my doctor. She makes sure I am comfortable 
1	I have an anxiety disorder, and it's actually the waiting room that's the biggest issue for me. It's always full of other patients and there are no windows and only one exit. I have one of those faces where I seem approachable, and people always try to talk to me which makes it worse.
-1	I start to feel anxious when I'm at the doctor because I worry that they will just kind of blow off what I'm telling them and under diagnose. I'm going through this situation currently where they don't know what is wrong and ordered physical therapy. It did not help but that makes me anxious wondering if they will even know what to do.
-1	Nothing particularly.  I generally just go for routine check-ups.  Nothing really bothers or concerns me when visiting my primary physician.
-1	Finding something wrong that may be life threatening or require surgery. Or disable me from working anymore. Being that I am now in my mid fifths is scary. My body has changed. 
1	"They're going to want to order more tests ""just to be sure"" so that our understanding goes from 90% likely to 92% likely, but these new tests are going to cost me enough to take years to pay off."
-1	I don't like having blood drawn. This is the only part of my doctor visits that I don't like. 
1	I think the waiting process in doctor's offices make me the most nervous, or anxious. For example, waiting in the lobby for an appointment, or waiting for shots or a lab result. The feeling of not knowing what to expect, or what the staff is going to tell you can be nerve-wracking.
-1	If I haven't been for awhile finding out through blood tests if everything is ok.Or how much a prescription will cost me. Also I just don't like getting undressed.
-1	I am always concerned the doctor is going to find something seriously wrong with me, something i have not noticed. Like a tumor or cancer or some type of STD. 
-1	if my health is at its normal standards. whether had weight gain, labs normal, if there is any need for new medications or not.
-1	When i have unexplained symptoms that are on going. When an illness lingers for a long time. When my blood pressure is high.
1	depends on why I am there.  If I have something wrong with me and don't know how it will be fixed, that can make me anxious.  or if my observation of the office environment, or the people working there sets me on edge.
1	my doctor is a good doctor he caress alot about me and my health my son sees him too the whole office is nice to us
-1	I don't like waiting in the waiting room. But I especially hate waiting in the examining room where it is so cold and there's nothing to do while you wait. Plus the visits are too short to delve into any problems you may have. The doctors are always in a big hurry to see as many patients as they can so you feel like you're not anything special. I wouldn't care if the doctor just pretended to be interested in my problems as long as he/she showed any interest at all.
1	My blood pressure always goes up at doctors.  Know will have to wait for results.  Sometimes doctor acts like his time is more important than you
-1	Usually it has to do with seeing how much weight I have gained. Other than that, my anxiousness could only be due to the unknown. But I have full trust in my PCP. 
-1	I only feel anxious when I know there's something wrong with me or I feel terribly ill. When I'm feeling that way, I start worrying that I might have something serious.
-1	I get worried when I go to doctors when they give me results of blood work or tests.
1	What they might find makes me feel most anxious. You might feel good but when you go to the doctor, you might discover that you have something wrong with you whether it's a disease or low vitamin levels. Also, the process of examination such as taking my blood and checking me makes me nervous. I don't like needles and I don't like a stranger touching me. 
-1	I anxious at what he has to say and his answers about what I asked him because always he is open and up to date about my health
-1	I'm at the age where 29 years of firefighting are catching up with me. This is wehre the weird cancers, heart problems, etc start coming in . I will probably have to take early retirement due to my TBI, so I am dreading that
1	I feel anxious, or worried because I wonder if I am going to be judged, or if they are going to tell me I have a serious life threatening issue going on. I wonder If something is going wrong if they will truly assist and do what they can to the max to ensure that every avenue, and the best avenue has been presented. I wonder if they even understand what I am feeling at that current moment. 
-1	I AM NOT ANXIOUS OR WORRIED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS EQUAL TO OR WORSE THAN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
1	i might not know what actually is wrong so fear of uncertainty occurs sometimes. also the higher cost involved in doing the unforseen illness.
-1	I have only felt anxious around a new doctor once or twice. This anxiety would likely be multiplied if the care provider were significantly younger than myself. Otherwise, I don't have issues with anxiety surrounding doctors appointments.  
-1	They might find major health problems

I had an ob once who called me fat the entire time I was pregnt and that I would be obese after giving birth. I knew I had gained a lot of weight but I was eating well and was exercising. Being pregnt I felt like I had no control over being able to actually lose weight until after giving  birth.

It is just the thought of the unknown, because we have all heard stories about the people who just go in for a normal check up and find something terribly wrong or something of that nature, and plus I had to get a series of painful shots when I was younger, so my perception of the doctor's office and hospitals has never been very good, although it has gotten better. It is more the place itself, and the unknown factor that worries me than anything that my doctor or any other physician does.
1	I hate shots, giving blood, etc., and will do anything I can to avoid them.  I wish there was a way for the doctor to put me more at ease.

1	The man barely looks me in the eye. He's very brusque. 
-1	Because instead of addressing the source of symptoms they usually just give you something to cover up the symptom while the underlying causes just get worse. And also because they are very time inefficient. I once had to sit in a room for an hour and a half with very excruciating pain just for the doctor to figure out my nose was broken, which i already knew but he didnt think so

-1	I think I'm more anxious about not finding the cause for my pain or injury.  There is nothing more discouraging than being shuffled between doctors who say there us nothing wrong with you based on their specialty and sending you to the next doctor.

-1	I feel anxious mostly because of just the uncertainty of what I  might find out, I think I go with the attitude to expect the worse. I also get upset because of having to wait for the doctor to do the exam, The waiting builds up my anxiety.
1	Because at my age any diagnostic test is a possible positive result. I am always looking to not have to treat things with medications.
-1	There really was nothing that made me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If anything, the only unpleasant part about visiting the doctor's office is the wait.

-1	i'm afraid to learn more bad news from my doctor about my condition that i didn't want to know. Ann visiting doctor's office everytime does make very anxious and nervous
-1	Since I do not feel these emotions when visiting my primary care physician, I will describe those feelings of going to my previous dentist.  I used to have these feelings when visiting my dentist because I wasn't taking good care of my teeth. I think I don't have these feelings now is because I have taken an active role in my total healthcare.
1	The possibility of finding out something is wrong can lead me to feel anxious or worried. The more regular my visits are the less worry this causes me.  
1	I feel like they don't really care that much and don't even try to pretend to.  They are quick to prescribe pills before any other options.
-1	I get apprehensive about what they may tell me about my test results, and how I will react if the news is bad.
-1	I am anxious over  the fact of trusting this person or not. Today's doctors care more about what pill they can prescribe over actually doing some work.

1	I think that makes me nervous or afraid the most when visiting my doctor is the fear of the unknown.

-1	Getting on the scale and seeing how much weight I have gained since my last office visit is worrisome 
-1	I do not have any medical problems I do not visit hospitals or have a primary physician. I do not take prescription medications.
-1	That they will find something wrong/incurable. 
-1	Nothing really in particular, I just have doctor anxiety -- along with general anxiety. I think the doctor called it White Coat Anxiety or something like that.
-1	I think there is always the thought in the back of my mind that something might be discovered that is a big health problem. I don't stay worried about this constantly, but that thought creeps up most times when I go to the doctor. There is cancer in my family history for example, and sometimes I worry about that. Really, it's just a general thought that pops up during doctor visits.
1	I don't like them picking at me and don't want them to find something they think they have to treat.
1	You just never know what is really going to happen if you have as many things wrong with you that I do. I hate going and get all worked up everytime I have to go. I just hate it more than I can Write.
1	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel most anxious about having my weight and blood pressure checked, because they are usually higher than recommended. I also feel stupid if I need to ask for clarification if I don't understand something the doctor said. And just being around people in general (in the waiting room, for example) makes me very anxious. I fear judgment and criticism, and also fear possibly becoming ill from sick patients.
-1	What would make me feel anxious or worried is the unknown. Primarily aside from yearly check ups the reason for going to the doctor would because there is somethingwrong with my body. So the not know what is going on would make feel uneasy.
1	I don't like being touched or judged. 
-1	I have high blood pressure and at anytime I expect that will effect me in a negative way, despite having it under control with meds, I do still get worried at exams or blood drain. Another is my age. I am over 50, so I know lots of thing a happen at this age range that I should be concerned about. Getting a colonoscopy is one thing I have not done yet, and I should.
-1	The times when I don't know what's wrong with me, or how much it's going to cost. Also if I don't know what to do after the doctor leaves the room (do I wait for a nurse? do I go to the checkout desk? do I just leave?)
1	"I have had fairly aggressive responses from professiols when I ask them simple questions. When I ask my healthcare providers questions I either get unsatisfactory answers or outright defiance. It is too easy to offend a medical professiol by ""questioning them"". Studies show that for a therapist their compassion is more highly correlated with their success than their skillset or education. As computers become more capable of diagnosing health problems (and as most doctors just put your symptoms into google these days anyway), I think we will have less autistic doctors that can ace any test and less stress in the doctor's office."
-1	Maybe I did not have a diet Maybe I did not have a diet And I worry that this causes weight gain or some very high values ââthat could harm my health
-1	Actually, nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. I have enjoyed reasonably good health and believe that so long as I try to take care of myself, I will be okay. I do understand better than many the vagaries of life and I can only control what I can control
-1	Wondering what the outcome of a prognosis will be can make me feel uneasy. Also worry about paying medical bills can give me and uncomfortable feeling.
-1	That the doctor may be over looking something or not considering all the available treatments available for my condition.
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is not being taking seriously. It seems most doctors are so quick to send you on their way so that they can get to their next patient. It is so hard to find a doctor who acts they actually care now - a - days. Im also worried about being treated for the wrong thing while the real problem is growing stronger. I had a friend who had a tumor the size of a basket ball on her uterus. The doctor told her she was pregnant. So for two months she walked around thinking she was pregnant. Turns out she had a very progressed cancer tumor on her uterus. She almost died from being mis- diagnosed.
-1	I have anxiety just being in medical buildings not because of the doctor herself. I also often feel worried when being examined that something wrong will be found.
-1	What makes me feel anxious when I'm visiting my doctor's office is what day might find. Since I don't visit the doctor as often as I should I get a little anxious or worried that that they might tell me something is bad about my health something I could be devastating to me so I get a little anxious but I think that's normal right?
1	The thought that there might be something medically wrong with me or I may be unhealthy. I am afraid they will tell me bad news.
-1	What makes me feel anxious is finding out a health condition that I didn't know I had or finding out treatments that can be done for a health condition that I'm not comfortable with
-1	What makes me anxious is when they may find something I knew nothing about because it showed no symptoms but most of the time im really just comfortable
1	i have seizures. i just never want to receive bad news. so every time I go to the doctor, i'm worried that i'm going to receive bad news. like the time when she said she'd recommend i don't drive. it's just nerve wrecking. 
-1	when a women goes to the doctor and the doctor tell them bad news. or tell them something that they don't want to hear 
1	I anxious about get my results . And I worried about have some deadly sickness and they is no cure for it 
1	Doesn't everyone hate to go to the doctor? I know that being weighed is necessary for medicine doses and determining overall health, but I'd go a lot more if they didn't weigh me every time. If I'm a couple pounds over my last visit weight, I'll do everything I can to lose it before going to the doctor, or just not go. I suspect this is very common.
1	Having my doctor shoot down the possibility that something may be wrong with me.  I worry that because of her, I won't find out about a medical condition until it is to late.
-1	When I visit the doctor's office I am most concerned about my weight and blood pressure.  My family has a history of heart problems and I want to stay ahead of the pack and avoid those issues.  I'm doing pretty well so far.
-1	It depends on the circumstances. I not usually anxious or worried at all about a routine examition. If I'm there because I'm injured or ill, I might be somewhat worried about my condition or the prognosis.
-1	I do not feel anxious at the Dr. Maybe annoyed because of wait times.
1	I am always anxious that there will be bad result or bad news.  I also am a little uncertain that the doctor is taking my actual thoughts or words into consideration. I know that he actually went to medical school but I live with me and know how I feel and what I am experiencing and to have a doctor disregard and dismiss my thoughts is upsetting.  I also do not like going to doctors I do not know who fill in because of bad experiences with rude doctors.
1	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I am relatively young and in good health, but I am always concerned that something will come up that I am not expecting. I am too anxious of a person over all, so this is really in line with my personality.
1	I worry that there might be something wrong with me and that I would need to get more tests done or even surgery and I worry what me family will do if I am not able to help as much as I have a son to support. 
-1	When I go to the doctor I am usually nervious some because they do blood work first before the actual physical. I always want to hear good news. I always want to know If I have been doing the right things to keep my body physically fit. Blood pressure, etc. is a small problem for me. My age predict what I can do and ear and participate . 
1	In the back or my mind there is always that idea that I could have some life altering disease that the Doctor will discover.  Because of my family history, I have a fear that I will develop some sort of cancer, and he'll find it, and tell me I'm termil. 
-1	I don't feel much anxiety when I'm at the doctor's office.
-1	I feel most worried when visiting a new doctor because I have to meet a new person and I don't know what to expect.

-1	Well when I go to doctor my blood pressure goes up   I get very nervous and anxious until I relax and calm down
1	When my doctor writes something down and doesn't mention anything about it to me. My doctor knows more about me than I do and I know nothing.
1	I am worried about the doctor finding an issue or something wrong. I am scared that the doctor will find something serious or something incurable. 
-1	I persolly just dislike the actual procedures. I'm not fond of the actual process as I am a very private person.
1	The waiting makes me the most uneasy. You wait in the waiting room, then you wait for the doctor and then you wait for the results. I hate the doctor wait game, it hurts my stomach.
1	I just don't like medical visits. You're vulnerable and not in control.
-1	The only thing that typically makes me nervous is the doctor finding something that concerns him that I had not recognized in myself.  The fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness, even though i'm not having any symptoms, is really what makes me anxious.
1	I feel most anxious about getting shots because of the pain , and the awkwardness of the situation . I am also worried the doctors may find issues with my health which can be very life changing .
-1	The bill I will receive 
-1	I have had t surgeries on my feet over the past two years. I am always anxious and worried when seeing him. I am always praying that things are a lot better with my feet. 
-1	They may find something wrong. Because I rarely go, I am worried they will find something I haven't noticed or overlooked. 
-1	I have not had to go to the doctor's office the last few years so I do not recall, I guess it would be when I see needles, though the nice nurses tend to make the anxiety go away

1	Sometimes when I take a test for any thing I be anxious, and worried about the test coming back, and hoping every thing comes back ok.
1	i don't feel anxious or worried at all if i am just having a visit or have only a small problem that is not serious.   if i had a serious problem, then i would be worried and maybe have a second opinion after their diagnosis of me

-1	That I will be forced into a new medication that my body won't tolerate. 
-1	I get worried or embarrassed if it's something super gross that I need the doctor to look at or I have a question about. I worry other doctors might know about it and think I'm weird, even though I know they've seen just about everything from their patients. 
-1	I only sometimes experience slight anxiety. This comes from a general sense that there could be something wrong with my health.
-1	The Dentist. Surgeons? Cake. Neurologists?  singing in the rain.  Dentists? It's like a nightmare  but real. 
1	I feel most anxious or worried that my doctor will find something serious wrong with me.  Something life threatening.
-1	The prospect of pain or experiencing something physically uncomfortable - having a boil lanced, or a skin biopsy taken. 
1	It isn't the doctor's office that makes me anxious. I deal with anxiety on and ongoing basis. If anything were to make me nervous, it would be the waiting time.
-1	I am not too anxious when going to my doctor, that is, about the physical exam. I do have social anxiety, so for the most part I am nervous around all people and social situations. So sometimes talking one on one and being physically examined makes me anxious, but it's not the doctor's fault.
-1	It is mostly that the experience will be unpleasant, not that the examination will find something wrong.  I'm also a little bit worried about being lectured on my bad habits, or pressured to do something expensive that I don't really need.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just the stigma of going in for an appointment. Being nervous about results or what you're being checked up on.

1	I get most upset and worried when it comes to physical examitions because of my own persol views about myself and my body.

1	That they will press on an issue that I don't feel like looking into or that I don't feel is serious. That they will refuse to continue seeing me if I don't do some kind of testing that I don't want to do. That they will think I'm lying when I say I have no issues.

He is always open and honest and has always taken very good care of us when we have had needs. We both go to the Doctor regularly and because of that and our relationship with the Doctor there is a large level of comfort now

1	Not sure what they will say. Sometimes they make me feel bad about myself.
-1	I haven't felt this way.  I guess if I knew something was seriously wrong with me I would be worried.
-1	Not knowing if they are going to find something is wrong with me, also it is very costly to go to a doctor.
-1	Not much really. It is a process I understand that has to take place and sometimes it is tedious and takes time to complete.  Too many blood draws on occasion 
-1	I feel upset if I am being taken care of by a PA/NP instead of an MD. I am wary of their diagnosis or whether or not they are able to give a better assessment than the MD.
-1	I think it's just the concept that you may be of ill-health and that's a very troubling and worrisome thought for anyone.
-1	Nothing really. I am usually at ease. I guess if I had to choose one thing it would be waiting in that small room all by myself.
-1	Mostly I'm anxious if something is wrong with me and I don't know what it is. If I'm waiting for test results or something, the not knowing is the worst part of it. Other than that, I don't really feel anxious
1	Just the fact that I'm sick enough to be at the doctor's is enough to make me sick. Then I also start worrying about how I'm going to come up with the money to pay the over-inflated doctors' fees.
-1	That he might find something wrong that I didn't know about.
1	I consider myself a hypochondriac so when I got to the doctor I sit there imagining all the things that could be wrong with me.
1	I am worried that the doctor is going to tell me that I have something seriously wrong. Ever since my dad's cancer diagnosis 4 years ago (and his ensuing death in 2015) I have been close to terrified every time I have to see the doctor. 
-1	I rarely feel anxious however I do become apprehensive if I am there for some sort of diagnosis regarding a symtom I have no idea what it could be caused by
-1	The only time I'm worried if there is something wrong that I haven't had looked at yet or if I'm waiting for results.
1	Cause I don't know what type of treatment I would receive due the facts of my current different health problems
1	That the doctor won't listen to me, will persist that something is better for me against my wishes, and will rush my appointment.
-1	I always think they will find something I didn't expect before entering. No one likes hearing bad news about their health, because it could be worse than they thought. I deal with any issue that comes my way, but it's a normal reaction to be worried that something is wrong, especially when feeling bad.
-1	i was quiet tensed if my health condition is not good. Even though it is small issue and it is not healing for many days that time i felt very disappointed. So at this type of issues i worried a lot. And each time i visit doctors office i was feeling like at least this time the problem should resolved. And also i was anxious about injections.
1	I always feel anxious at the doctor office, because I never know what they are going to find.  Even if I am healthy, I worry they may find something bad.
1	I tend to get anxious about having to go to the doctor's because of the unfamiliar environment and what the possible outcome is during my visit. I also get worried about the drive there because I don't like driving. I also feel uneasy having to explain my problems, especially if they're embarrassing. 
-1	
1	The results of my blood work can cause me to worry a little, but not much...I know that I just need to focus on the issues and do my best to make sure my health improves
1	When I go to the doctor's office I have a hard time not thinking of the worst possible outcome. All the uncertainty can give me anxiety. 
-1	Something comes up with my system that he may call my attention to that I couldn't see or recognize on my own before showing up.
1	I worry that there might be something more wrong with me than I was expecting.
-1	I hate to have my yearly mammogram .My mother's two sister's both died from breast Cancer, so I am very concerned that this disease could run in the family as I am the second generation
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when i go visit my doctor. I am not a person who worries about much about nothing
-1	There is nothing for me to get anxious around my doctor because I trust him to the fullest he will take good care of me
-1	That I may have some dread disease that cannot be cured or will take a log of treatments to cure.  That the chronic condition that I have has gotten worse or something is prescribed that I cannot accomplish
1	Not knowing results or cause of illness is the most worrying part of doctors visit. The anticipation of knowing answers makes me anxious.
1	I feel anxious when waiting for test results. The uncertainty of not knowing what is going on with my body makes me worried. I also dread having examinations where the doctor must physically touch my body.
1	When I go to the doctor, I often think if I happen to have something that is not yet discovered in me as those silent diseases that makes me feel anxious
-1	Nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when I'm visiting the doctor. I know I'm there to get checked out and I'll take the next step as it comes. 
-1	I can sometime imagine that he will find something terribly wrong with me, even though I am not feeling bad.
-1	I have a great physician so, I never feel nervous or anxious. My only concern is he is nearing retirement.
-1	They could find that something is wrong with me.
-1	When a doctor makes minor indications that something is wrong, it is my natural response to assume the worst even though it is very rarely the case.
1	I always feel like I'm getting in trouble when I go to the doctor.  I see them as an authority figure and having to discuss any issue in detail causes me great anxiety.  I feel that they will blame me for whatever health issue is going on.  I don't feel they will be open to discussing other options or side effects of medications they prescribe.  I often feel dismissed if I want to try alternative natural options.  They treat me like I'm inferior and they know best.  I hate having to feel like I need to fight for my own health issues, instead of just do what is convenient for them.
-1	Depending on the reason of why I am going to the doctor, certain situations may make me feel a little uneasy. Waiting for labs or certain test results can cause some worry.
1	I am not comfortable getting naked in front of man I do not know.  I do not think that healthcare providers give a patient enough information about what they will be doing BEFORE they do it which makes me very jumpy.  I do not get in another person's personal space without permission or without telling them what I am doing.  I don't think it's too much to ask of virtual strangers especially when I am already naked and vulnerable.  I worry about what tests I will be told I need as many of them are painful or at least uncomfortable especially when someone has an issue with the sight of needles.  I worry about being diagnosed with a condition that could mean significant lifestyle changes or death.
-1	I fear that maybe i'll walk out with a deadly illness
-1	I am always worried that something far worse than I have will occur. I tend to think overly regarding what could possibly be wrong. It is usually something pretty common however.
-1	
-1	I feel  worried because maybe there is something wrong with me.  Maybe I did something that wasn't right.
-1	That I'll be told I've exhausted all my treatment options for my condition or that the remaining treatment options are out of my price range.
1	I feel like my doctors don't think my illness are that serious. He makes me feel like it's emotional  or physical.
-1	I'm most worried about how long it takes.   Generally, going to the doctor's office does not worry me
1	I am afraid of being judged.  I am overweight and I haven't been to a PCP in many yrs.  Both of these things will bring judgment on me.
-1	The unknown is frightening. I don't live the healthiest lifestyle and I sometimes worry about the further decline of my health as i get older.
-1	The fact that something else could be wrong with me. I usually like going to the doctors. So, not too   much stress.
1	I usually worry that they will find something wrong with me that is serious. I tend to assume the worst. I look to them to calm me down and help me see that chances are good it's nothing serious.
-1	I don't usually feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. The only thing that might worry me would be the discovery of a negative health condition or disease.
-1	If I think that something is wrong and I might get a not so good diagnosis or like the treatment option that the doctor is recommending, because of the negative side effects; then I have to weigh the risks of treating the problem verses not taking the treatment and possibly making the condition worst, also if there is going to be a problem with the insurance company covering the treatment or if I will have a very high out of pocket expense and then have to figure out how to pay for treatment/medication I may really need for a particular condition.
1	They might found something wrong and it might not be curable I would like a female doctor I am shy of anyone looking at my body
1	I guess it would be the waiting game. Waiting to get the test, then waiting for the results, waiting for the call that everything is fine, you hope and pray. 
1	I hate going in and having to wait hours to be able to see the doctor.  And then you wait another hour in the room with the nurse doing the basics. She writes everything down. Then I have to tell the whole story again to the doctor while they input the information again and again. They hardly spend any time listening to your heart or examining you at all.  It has been five years and I have not had a pap smear.  They say because of my age that they do not need to do that, but I am still sexually active.  So therefore, it should be done. My step mom had cervical cancer at 75.  So it can happen.
-1	I think going to the doctor, in general, gives me a little anxious feeling.  Whether you are going because of a problem or a regular examination, the feeling of wonder about what he/she will say about your health is definitely present.
1	I often have to have physical examitions and blood tests.  The blood tests especially incite dread, anxiety, etc in me simply because I know they will hurt.  Even the physicals give me discomfort though.  I also worry about what thing I will have to correct my doctor on this time.
1	Taking my. Mood pressure. White coat syndrom causes blood pressure to rise more than usual. Also hate checking weight in doctor office. 
-1	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor. 
-1	I am getting older and feel that the whole health-care system is neglecting the elderly when it comes to the best possible care.
1	They might find something seriously wrong with you, or they need to perform some invasive procedure.
-1	I usually don't feel anxious at the doctor. But sometimes I feel anxious at the doctor with my kids, I just want them to be healthy and I get nervous if something is wrong.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried. I mostly already know why I'm going to the doctor to begin with and always leave out satisfied. 
1	What makes me feel most anxious and worried when the visiting the doctor is not knowing whats wrong or knowing whats could be wrong and finding other things that are wrong
1	Pain is the thing I worry about the most and second would be if the person knows how to do their job correctly and has an all right attitude.
1	That she not going to find out what's wrong with me and won't help me get         better. I'm always disappointed when I leave her office
-1	Like I said before changing doctors all the time and we dent have a constant doctor when I go themes different doctors everyday 
-1	A long wait makes me feel anxious.  If the doctor were to suggest a test that I was not expecting I would be worried.
-1	to tell me what is wrong with me, or being upset because i haven't changed anything on my life. or the things that will be prescribed when I'm done with the visit. and paying the bill
-1	When I go to the doctors office, I will often feel a bit anxious. This is mostly because there are plenty of illnesses that can come up unexpectedly and I'm afraid that something bad will happen to me.
1	Just the whole idea of not knowing what is going on with your own body. Fearful of family history of diseases.
1	I am worried about making sure to resolve whatever issue I have come in for. I am worried about my insurance working properly. I am anxious about what questions the doctor will ask.
-1	I am rarely sick.  when I go to the doctor it is routine follow up on chronic diseases I have dealt with for over 20 years. 
-1	I have PTSD and have been nervous talking about it, which is the reason I've most commonly gone to the doctor recently.
1	I know that I'm not as healthy as I should be so any visit to the doctor makes me worry that I am going to hear bad news. 
-1	The thing I find most worrisome is a doctor not being able to recognize the symptoms of what I may be going through
-1	I am worried that the doctor will find something that is very serious wrong with me and that the treatment will be long term and expensive or that it will be something that can not be treated.
1	My mother having to be up my rear end when it comes to my medical information. And the fact that the doctors allow her to be here while I am an adult is really uncalled for. 
1	What make me worry is uncertainty and thinking the worst sometimes. But usually I go to the doctors and find out that it's nothing. And that I am just worrying myself for nothing. But I am somewhat glad that I think this way because I fell that it gets me perpared for when it is. 
-1	Worried that she might give me a diagnosis I didn't expect but so far she's been up front with me about my health 
-1	I guess after having colon cancer and prostate cancer I get anxious when it is time to have my colonoscopy and my psa test.and sometimes just waiting to get the results
1	I think the fear that something might be wrong with me is the worst. The scary thing is that even if you think it's something small it might turn into something huge. I can see why people try to avoid it.
1	Sometimes i just dont want to be at the doctors or even hear what a doctor has to say sometimes i just put off going to the doctor
-1	Wondering if there's any new condition or if I am as healthy as I try to be. Hoping nothing comes up that would require a prescription or any medication that I can't remedy myself. I just hope all of my exams have good and positive results meaning good health.
-1	If I am worried about what I'm there for, then I'm worried.  For example, I had a lump that needed to be examined. My doctor was not concerned, but because of my level of concern, had no problem referring me for further diagnostics to help ease my mind.  Waiting for the results was the anxious part, but because my doctor was not concerned at all, it helped ease the anxiety.
1	The doctor may have bad news that u may not b ready to hear u may not know how to deal with it that's s
-1	Sometimes if I need bloodwork done I worry about the results, but other than that nothing really upsets me. 
1	Sometime I get worried that something will be wrong. I have two beautiful daughters and I always want to be healthy for them. I also have a long family history of breast and ovarian cancer. As well as heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. I always worry that I maybe suseptable to one of these conditions and it worries me.  I ear that one day I will be checked or tested and Iâll end up with a condition that a family member of mine had. 
1	i only go to the doctor when im worried about my health therefore when i see him or her it is about something i do not know about my body
-1	Anything involving needles. I have a HUGE needle phobia that has oftentimes prevented me from getting typical blood work or vaccines.
-1	When I go to the doctor I'm always worried they will find something wrong. It's just a crazy feeling. Why ? I don't know.Its like that all of the time no matter what the reason for me being there.
1	I feel worried about what could be wrong. I rarely will see a doctor due to the fear that something major could be wrong medically. Also anxious due to feeling like the Dr does not want to be bothered with me as a patient.
-1	Typically, its a situation when I know something is wrong with me, but I'm also aware that the costs may be too expensive to do anything about. I had a tonsil infection, and I was unable to eat comfortably for days. I didn't know how much the medicine would cost and I had to pay out of pocket. It cost me $300 at the urgent care to get treated and to be able to eat again. It's always an affordability issue.
-1	Naturally, I am a worrier. I feel that I can do better in taking care of my self and my health and so in the back of my mind I am always a little concerned
1	"I worry I am not being taken seriously and that I am going to be told or made to think ""it is all in my head"". I worry that they are in such a rush that they will not really listen and hear me or my concerns. I worry that ""because I am young"", they are going to assume everything is fine and I have nothing to worry about."
-1	The only thing that could make feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is if they tell me I have adisease
-1	I hate waiting for my appointment time when I arrive ahead of or on time. The waiting sparks my anxiety and resulting psychological discomfort. 
1	My blood pressure results, first off. It always runs really high. And I hate to see my weight because I really need to lose about 15-20 pounds. Also, they always ask me about smoking and drinking, of course, and I am a little embarrassed by how much I do of both because I know that should be less.
1	Nothing in particular, I, like most people just don't really like having to go to see a doctor and only go when I feel like I need to.
1	I do not like the smell of the waiting room because it smells like the alcohol wipes. I also do not like waiting when I am just going for a checkup and I have to be around all the other sick people. I also just do not like shots and that makes me the most anxious.
1	One of the things is my weight. I've always been overweight and I dread even getting on the scale and another person knowing my weight. I also worry I'll be lectured about it or it will be named as a cause for whatever ailment I might have. I often don't go to the doctor when I should so that my weight is never known or discussed. I also worry about my issue, which I may think is trivial, turning out to be something more serious than I thought.
-1	Only when a new or unexpected new symptom or adverse reaction happens and the doctor is puzzled or deeply concerned about it -- the whys, hows and whens plus likely or possible future issues.  
-1	The possibility of getting bad news causes a small amount of anxiety. It's also not the most comfortable experience to be examined by a person that's basically a stranger.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is finding out if there is something serious going on with my body, as well as not always knowing my exact medical health and finding out something terrible.

1	I'm anxious about my diagnosis and prognosis, how it is going to effect my life going forward and if it will effect my family also 
1	That they will say something that is not what I wanted to hear. Also that they might now really look into what is going on.
-1	I am most anxious about screenings for diseases such as cancer and heart because there's always an element of doubt on how the results will be and if I would require further tests. 
-1	Pain, I have several chronic conditions and by the time she is donevwith me I have a lot of pain from the exam
1	White coat syndrome, it makes my blood pressure go up ten to fifteen percent. The unknown but also satisfaction that I go to my yearly check ups and hoping o don't have to bend over for a test
-1	Except for routine visits, I go to the physician because of an acute condition. I usually know the best and usual course of treatment because I have researched it prior to the visit. I am anxious because my physician is sometimes blase and doesn't show the concern that I would expect.
1	I am growing older and always fear that something new may be revealed. I also have a breast tumor which always worries me although it has remained 'harmless' for over 20 years.
1	I don't like to have my body examined, as I feel a little uncomfortable with it. Also I am always worried he might find something seriously wrong with my health. 
1	I guess it is just a normal anxious thing for most everyone. The waiting is probably the biggest thing that makes me anxious. 
1	It's ultimately the fear of the unknown. I could be walking around unknowingly with a disease that could kill me and not find out until it's too late.  
-1	I always feel anxious because i think he might find something wrong that cannot be easily fixed, or that is chronic.
-1	I fear that he is going to find something wrong and then I will have to take medicine or have more test ran. I also fear that he will tell me some devastating news.
-1	Blood test results, because I've gotten back results in the past that have shown high cholesterol and anemia, so I'm always concerned something is going to come back higher or lower than it should
-1	M  My .i me bad news When I visit the doctor I am most anxious that she will give me bad news.  My medicine she prescribes for me only manages my symptoms.  
1	It not always a lot of fun going to the doctor depending on why you are going, and sometimes it makes me a bit anxious or nervous. It just is not a fun place to be
1	The unknown. Basically not knowing beforehand what the outcome of the visit might be. Also I worry if there are any changes in office staff who I don't know, due to the fact I am not all that confident if the new staff can be discreet.
1	Just the not knowing if anything unexpected may show up in some kind of test or blood work.  You just never know when some type of medical problem that is unexpected happens.
-1	will I be able to get my prescriptions filled from my healthcare provider, and how long is the wait time
-1	I get worried about my blood pressure. something about the white coat sets it off. the older you get the more you worry about things
-1	I am never anxious when I visit my doctor.  I have a list of concerns that we go over, and I leave on a very positive note.
-1	My blood pressure runs a little high. I do not want to be on blood pressure medication so I am worried that each time they take my blood pressure it will be high.
1	life  over time bout like if u care to read the like of books.an books of lifeenothing less n othing moreee
-1	I may feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit if I'm going in for test results, other than that I am confident that I'm receiving the care I need.
1	Well personally I don't like to be touched and I don't like to be spoken to in a demeaning way. I'm very bright, I'm in a Ph.D. program for pete's sake so it makes me worried that physicians think I'm stupid but aren't even nice about it and don't try to explain in  a way that would make sense to me or don't even take the time. Also the being touched thing is obviously a huge source of anxiety as well which stems more from my personal history. Like I'm 22 and I still haven't had a pap smear because I just can't do it. And I had an older male doctor as a kid who didn't explain what he was doing and was examining me and it was just a weird and difficult experience and it's hard to advocate for yourself with a doctor when they always think they know best. Sorry this answer is so long I hope it kind of made sense! Also bruh I don't understand health insurance for the life of me so that makes me worried too. I hate spending money so having to pay $25 for a copay when I feel like the doctor didn't even do anything makes me cranky and anxious about my budgeting. 
1	That the physician will give you a negative report/diagnosis. Doctors don't have a positive bone in their bodies. It is ALWAYS doom and gloom with them. They just  approach a patient with how the odds of getting well are so low. Their game plan is to give you a lot of medicines or advice a sometimes unnecessary surgery. Again, to make money for hospitals and drug companies.
-1	I haven't felt anxious or worried about visiting a doctor's office since I was a small child. I don't really enjoy sitting nude with nothing but a paper shirt on, but it doesn't make me anxious or worried.

1	My child I'm always worried about him. I dont know how to stop my worry. I know things will be okay but I still worry alot

1	Most of the time I feel dread and anxious because I'm scared of what they will find out and the cost of the visits and treatments. I'm also scared of their opinions of me in regards to taking care of myself the proper way.
-1	to see what my blood pressure goes to.  I do not like going to the doctor have white coat sydrome but its ususally ends up ok.
-1	Not too much makes me concerned when I am at the doctors office. i dont go very often but when I do it's usually not for a major issue, its just because its time to check up on my health so usually I am not worried. If there is something going on that brings me in that might make me a little anxious, especially if I have to get tests done because I dont get the results right away.
1	I am worried that I will not understand what the doctor is talking about, especially if something is wrong with me. I am anxious about whether or not the doctor will take me seriously. 
1	I do not want the doctor to find something very wrong with me. Just not knowing what can come about at the doctors office makes me anxious and worried
-1	What makes me feel most anxious at the doctor's office is, by far, getting immunizations. While I agree to get any that are recommended, even ones that aren't strictly required by the office or by my college because I believe in taking any health precautions available to me, I am very afraid of needles and get almost pancicked when I need to have a shot.
-1	I dont feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctors office. I often feel safe and that I am going to get better.

1	I just worry something bad will be found. That's always a possibility. I dont really like being touched by a stranger either.

1	It's really only certain types of exams that make me feel nervous and dreading the appointment. These are procedures that I find extremely uncomfortable, so I put them off. Often, I don't get them done. 
-1	Sometimes I encounter health professionals that blow of my symptoms so any worry is about getting them to investigate my symptoms instead of ignoring them.
-1	"Since I have diabetes, I am aware of its symptoms and comorbid conditions/disorders. The main thing I worry about when visiting the doctor's office is being ""found out"" if I didn't follow doctor's orders from the last visit or I slipped a little. I want to present as the perfect patient, though I know there's not one. I don't like being told I'm doing something wrong since I do try so hard to maintain any and all progress. "
1	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fear of the unknown. Even if I am at the doctors for something minor routine test can show something worse.
-1	if I have a new symptom then I get nervous since I have had cancer twice already. I worry that there is a new cancer or the old one has come back. 
-1	it makes me worried to hear what the doctor has found in the physical. and if i have to be on any  meds

-1	"I get anxious about how the doctor will treat me and whether they will take me seriously.  I'm usually more worried about the doctor dismissing me than I am about them finding a serious health problem.  I also worry about the inevitable ""you're fat"" lecture.  I know it matters, but it still makes me feel bad."
1	"Just the thought of MAYBE something being wrong with you. Sometimes I have moments of ""what have I done with my life?"" Then I think of all the things I've missed out on."
-1	Nothing I'm always confident in my visits everything is always upfront and open honesty makes it easy I truly trust my doctors
1	Honestly I don't know. I have always felt this way and my blood pressure always rises to the point that I have to warn my nurse
-1	Doctor's offices and hospitals in general are never fun places to be, it's where people go when they are sick or hurt or dying.  Really not a whole lot of positive connotations there. Also, there's always an irrational fear the doctor is going to stick you with needles or tell you you have cancer or whatever.
1	If I have a condition that suddenly occurred and I cannot find any information about it. I am also worried about high medical bills.
-1	They will rush you. Support staff seems disinterested and abrupt. Lack of professionalism in general and seem almost undereducated.

-1	I don't be anxious or worried and just try to have a positive attitude about seeing the doctor because she is easy to talk to about what ever it is.
1	That I've either come in about an issue that's too trivial to need a doctor's attention, or that I've waited too long on an issue when I should have known it was more serious. Basically that there are multiple ways my own judgement could be wrong. That I'll embarrass myself by making a bigger deal out of something than is warranted. That I might have to redirect a conversation of the doctor seems to jump to wrong conclusions or makes bad assumptions.
1	it might be bad experiences in my childhood
1	My mind always goes to the worst case scenario when I don't feel well or my kids don't feel well. I am always worried that my own diagnosis will be confirmed or that the course of treatment for whatever is wrong will be expensive or time consuming. I really fear being sick or injured and really worry that I something terrible will happen and I will get diagnosis that something is wrong.
-1	Most of the time I am not very anxious nor worried when visiting the doctor's office. But when I am it is probably because I am over thinking my sickness.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is when i'm sitting in the waiting room forever
-1	I am worried that they might find something wrong with me. That a routine visit will turn into a disaster.
1	I'm worried that they will say something about my weight or blood pressure or that I'll have a negative result when I go. I know that I don't have the healthiest exercise or eating or drinking routine and I'm sure that it'll catch up to me at some point. So, the concern is that it catches up to me when I'm at the doctors and I get awful news.

1	I always wonder if he will find something that I'm not aware of , that has no symptoms.  This has happened to me years ago so it's always in the back of my mind when I go for a check up.
1	I'm anxious because of the news I will get. I'm worried about the amount of time it will take and how long before I'm seen

1	I worry something terrible is wrong with me. I worry the news I get will be devastating and irreparable 
-1	What makes me most anxious is not knowing what kind of results I will receive about my health. I worry that I may have something unhealthy or otherwise bad lurking in my body.

1	The anxiety from visiting a doctor's office comes from the worry that the doctor will tell me I have a serious medical problem rather than something trivia and temporary. There is also the dread about entering a hospital even to see the doctor.
1	I am a generally anxious and uneasy person. I takes a lot for me to trust someone on a persol level. Therefore, my visit's to the doctor tend to bring on anxiety and worry.
1	I know going in I may have to bring research and my power of persuasion to get diagnosed correctly and get the right medications. It was bad when I had insurance and had to do this. It's many times worse now that I go to a clinic for the poor and see nurses instead of doctors.
-1	Nothing, I am never anxious or worried when visiting my Doctor's Office.  He always listens to me and cares to see that I have the best meds and best treatment that is available for my condition.

-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried because I trust my doctor completely. She cares about my well being.
1	I feel anxious because I am a person that is reserved. I am quiet so it is hard to open up to somebody. 
1	I don't like to be undressed in a doctor's office. I don't like to show my body to anyone but my husband. I hate getting tests done and i don't know the results of the test
1	Just what they may find. Something that I wasn't expecting. Me needing a treatment I can't afford. Just the whole experience really. 
-1	When visiting a doctor's office I feel anxious about any health situations that might be brought up when having a discussion with my doctor. I need to know that everything will be fine and that a serious illness will not occur.
-1	Sometimes health issues come out of seemingly nowhere and even though I try to live as healthy as I can, I am concerned that I might have a condition. Family history tells me I could get certain health conditions.

-1	That they are going to tell me some sad news. Or want to do a lot of test or take blood and I hate needles.
1	I tend to be a very anxious person.  When I go to the doctor's office, I tend to assume the worst for my health or that I have something wrong with me when it tends not to be true. 
-1	"While I have never really experiences the sensation of anxiety or worry when visiting a doctor or health care provider, I can definitely imagine why many people are apprehensive.  Many people are worried that the treatment may hurt or feel uncomfortable during the exam.  People may also be scared to hear the truth regarding their condition and be in a state of ""ignorance is bliss"".  These factors cause people to not only worry and become anxious, but to also not follow up or seek treatment for their condition or ailments."
1	I just worry that I might have to go through another surgery.  I also have a fear in needles  I also just have bad experience with doctors when I was child.
-1	I hate shots. I am an adult and I just hate them. I get queasy and I know it is coming. I worry also about my insurance covering everything due to a medical bill in the past. 
-1	Scared I would leave hearing bad news. Going to the doctor and not knowing if I'm going to walk out with a condition I didn't walk in with
1	I have social anxiety so i have difficulty communicating at times. Having someone ask me personal questions or see me in a vulnerable position can make me feel uneasy. 
1	My doctor expects me to follow his medical advice.  I am always concerned about how well I followed his advice.  I follow it to the best, but I hope I do not fail.
-1	
-1	I sometimes feel like the diagnosis does not match my symptoms. But I know it is all in my head. It is a character flaw nothing to do with my doctor. 
1	trying to locate the cause of my health issue. Most often we go to the doctors believing the worst, sometime it is, but most often the problem is reversible or easily treatable. Upon knowing the issue and it can be fixed or cured, causes the worry and fear to disipate.  
1	They look at me weird something about them is off and I go to the doctor alest 4 times a week and I just want answers
1	I'm overweight and very self-conscious/embarrassed by it.  I know I'm not taking the best card of myself and I just dread being told what I already know; it feels shameful.
-1	Many refuses to hear that they have a medical issue so of course I will become a bit worried;  not completely worried, but just a tad bit.  Anxiety the least but worried just a little. No one wants to hear bad news.
1	i am already dealing with a few health issues myself.  so when i go to the doctor i am expecting unpleasant news.  it is like you found this last time now lets see what else we can find. 
-1	My doctor's voice on the phone if she calls me.  My doctor's the best in the world. She is good at what she does.
-1	I do not feel anxious are worried during my doctor visits in general. Unless, I am seeking surgery or a chronic uncurable condition, doctor visits are generaly unstressful
-1	What they have to tell me or if I have to take a different medication.  Also , if I have to get a shot or something .
1	The only thing that would make me feel worried was if I was really sick or though that a really bad diagnosis was on it's way.   Not knowing what is wrong is the main worry that I would have.
-1	The thought of something being wrong with me is of course my worry. I think everyone has that same feeling. 
1	I do not like being scrutinized with weight, blood pressure etc. I would prefer to never go to the doctor, however I know I need to. I don't always feel that doctors are really listening to all of my symptoms and I don't like taking unnecessary medications.
-1	Waiting in the waiting area.  I hate it because when they give you an appointment time and you show up, they should be ready to see you.
1	who knows, there are so many symptoms that can be said to be related to all kinds of diseases, nobody wants to let some body else tell them that they have diseases
-1	How much the cost is going to be, and what my blood pressure is - although that seems to get me worked up and drive it up more, ha.
-1	nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when going to the doctor i am just turally that way. it isnt being there that is causing the feelings its just life in general
1	I'm more worried that I will have to see a doctor who doesn't know me at all.  That's a possibility with clinics.  I have chronic health issues and hate it when I have to explain everything from the beginning - 26 years ago they started.  
-1	
1	I am afraid that something will be wrong, and talking to people in any situation causes me anxiety. I am also extremely pain averse.
1	i always worry that i haven't been doing the right things to be proactive with my health. i have a lot of health problems so that makes it harder. 
-1	I feel a little anxious going to the doctor on the account of the results going to a doctors appointment
1	I'm mostly uncomfortable having an unknown person examine my body.  This makes me anxious to be done with it as quickly as possible.
-1	I just have general anxiety when at the doctor's office. It is a general fear of sickness and I am always nervous that I am not in as good as health as I should be.
1	I just do not know if they will find out that something is wrong with me. I usually feel healthy but there is always a little uncertainty that something might be wrong without me knowing. 
1	I worry that my blood pressure will be high again and that worry makes it worse.  I also worry that my disease will be out of remission and I will not be able to work.
-1	I worry about the outcome of exams.The possibility of some life threatening condition causes worry, but for the most part I have very few problems with exams.
1	for me; because of my diabetes; i am always worried that there is some kind of complication that goes wrong for my body as a result of this disease.
1	You just never know what you are getting into or what you will be diagnosed with. It's always fearful not knowing what you're about to hear, especially pertaining to your health.
-1	I am really never anxious when I visit my doctor.  Although I may be a little worried about what might be wrong -- she and/or her staff usually are able to put my mind at ease!
-1	I hope that I haven't gained weight and I am always concerned about my blood pressure the worst part is just getting to the hospital traffic can be horrible
1	I am most worried about my doctor personally attacking me for my choices I have made. It is hard telling how he will act. 
-1	Not knowing what the doctor will tell me. Uncertainty of the situation.
1	I always feel anxious or worried when visiting, just because if there is bad news to be given, that is where it is going to come from.  I am not the healthiest person ever, and I know that one day that could all backfire on me.
1	Sometimes I feel like everything is alright, but crazy things happen all the time. Far of the unknown worries me the most.
1	Nothing really makes me anxious when going to the doctor,except having my blood pressure and weight checked. I always feel like my weight is an embarrassment and having to share that with a nurse makes me feel bad. My blood pressure is usually healthy anyway, but it still makes me nervous waiting for them to stop pumping the sleeve.
-1	If I feel that I could possibly have a serious problem that will require a lot of treatments as well as money, and cause me to be out of work for a long period of time. I may also get anxious if I feel that the doctor doesn't have my best interests in mind.
-1	i do not worry about going to see my doctor he is very through and does not beat around the bush. i get routine blood work done ebery three months
1	I guess the number one thing is fear that a routine exam or test will uncover something really wrong with me.  Now, to be fair, I am a paranoid hypochondriac.  So any time I get the slightest little pain or perhaps a lump or something, I am convinced it's terminal cancer and I'm going to die in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, that has so far not happened.  So I think it's very important that I have the ability to access proper medical care (in the past I haven't always had the access)  to go and get checked out on a regular basis, more for my own mental peace of mind than because there is something actually really wrong with me.  Other than that, sometimes I do worry that a doctor or nurse will be judgmental and make comments to me about certain unhealthy characteristics like my weight or smoking, but that's not nearly as big a concern.
1	I have severe anxiety to begin with so I don't need a reason to be anxious as I'm always anxious - usually without reason.
-1	When I visit my doctor I am not anxious or worried because I take his advice and  do what I am supposed to do to make sure I am doing alright.
-1	How invasive things can be. That's what prevents me from going most of the time. I'd like to be able to discuss things with a doctor remotely (say, online) and then if a more invasive visit is needed we could arrange for a face-to-face. 
-1	I just get nervous when I go to the doctor. I usually only go when I don't feel well so I worry that there is a serious problem making me feel ill
1	I have had a recent bad experience of finding out a health conflict I am working through. So now I am on hyper alert and nervous about possible other health issues.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctor's office due to the face I don't have any major health issues.
-1	What makes me most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is if any of the procedures they'll be performing on me are painful or not. Another thing that makes me somewhat anxious is when they ask me questions that I find to be too personal or embarrassing.
-1	I don't like drawing blood. Last time I went to the doctor they stuck me three times and couldn't get any because I was so tense. They told me to go to a lab and I refuse to, even if I probably should see my lab results. 
1	I feel as though the drs. may find something seriously wrong with me. I am afraid of the things the tests and labs will show.
-1	When I go to see my doctor I have a certain mindset. I do not let my emotions interfere with my mind, because as we know it can be deter mental to your health. So when I go to see my physician I usually listen to some calm music, trying to calm my nerves if anything, because as any human being we all have emotions, but we can control them, that's matter of practice. So in nutshell when I see my doctor I do not feel anxious or worried about anything and give myself the best chance possible to win. My mind is always on point, I am awake and aware.
-1	I worry over the fact that i may have a serious medical issue that may need surgery or something else real serious
-1	I have had some medical isseus in the past and I always worry it may come up again 
-1	I feel most anxious and worried when going to the doctors because I want it over with.nerves run through a woman.
-1	I feel that I have a pretty good bead on what is wrong with me medically.  I am never really expecting anything groundbreaking or life changing to happen or be told to me.  A doctors office visit for me is more of a chore then anything else.
1	I WORRY THATY I CANNOT ACCURATELY EXPLAIN SO SHE WILL UNDERSTAND
1	I always get nervous at the doctor before testing procedures because I have had a lot of health problems so I am scared that something else will come up but I always have a lot of trust in my doctor.
-1	I don't. This doesn't apply to me. I don't go in feeling nervous or anxious when going to the my doctors.
-1	THERE ARE NO REASONS TO FEEL ANXIOUS I GET ALL MY NEEDS WITH MY DOCTORS IT IS A GREAT AND RELIEFE EXPERIENCE
1	Ever since I found out I have a rare blood disease I feel a sense of dread and worry whenever I see the doctor.  It passes as soon as she tells me everything is okay, but up until that moment, I feel worried and nervous.
1	Well the only thing that make me worried or anything is when I know and feel my pain and the doctor's just may send you to get x rays to see if anything is broken but when they find out its not they just send you to physical therapy forgetting about what you are suppose to do in the mean time. Also sometimes im scared the people that are taking blood or giving a shot dont know what they are doing.
-1	That they make a recommendation that I disagree with. Or that they can find something I did not know about
-1	Nothing really does, unless I am there in pain or concerned about my health for some reason, that usually is not the case though.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is getting my blood pressure taken. I know I have good blood pressure but it always makes me nervous just in case this one time I don't. 
-1	If I had symptoms of what I considered a serious illness, I would be anxious or worried that I could not be treated successfully.
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor's office when I have to have my blood pressure taken. I can take it at home and it is fine, the minute I get into a doctor's office it gets high. The doctor told me I have white coat syndrome. Always a little concerned whenever they do an EKG. Since I have had a triple bi-pass back in 2004. But it always comes out OK. Get a little anxious when I have to wait too long in the doctor's office. Unfortunately that happens from time to time. But I would rather wait a little long then have the doctor rush through with everyone.
-1	It is an irrational emotion that sometimes comes up, but not always.  I like to have the experience behind me each year.  As I have aged, this has been the case, for when I was young, I seldom saw a physician, except once for a gall bladder attack due to which, the gall bladder was removed. That period was somewhat anxious until over.  But that was 25 years ago. 
-1	When I see my doctor, I don't worry about my  check up they give me, because I know I am doing everything, I can to talk good care, of my self.
1	when i might need to take a test for something that's might be wrong or when it's time for my yearly check and i have t have blood work i hate needles
-1	I am healthy so going to a doctor's office does not make me anxious though when they take my blood pressure it is usually higher then normal. So subconsciously it may bother me a bit.
-1	Wondering what the outcome of my exam would be. Imagining if there is something wrong and what needs to happen next.
