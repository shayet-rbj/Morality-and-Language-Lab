0.861100	I have had a few medical issues since I was born, and am fairly accustomed to medical forms and medication instructions.  Also, my mother is a nurse and works interviewing patients, and I have learned a bit from her about how hospitals and the medical industry work.  I feel like this makes me capable of understanding most information presented to me by my doctor.
0.916667	  i am very health smart and i use the computer for years to read about many of my own conditions and many others.I am very interested in medical issues and reading on them.

0.900000	I feel I have full capacity to process basic health information and to make decisions appropriate for me.

I'm best at processing and understanding written information when taking the time to perform more research on the information in question.

0.783300	I have no problem answering or asking questions regarding my health. Growing up, my mother was a nurse so I was often around medical jargon.

0.805600	I have no problem keeping my medical appointments, however I write a list of things to ask when I meet with my Dr. and I forget to take my list with me. I'm married to a retired RN and she is a big help with my understanding my health care. I'm seeing 5 specialists so it's hard to keep on top of it.

I understood that, but I asked why is that important and was just told that it is and see you later.  
0.800000	Am very health concussion ,and feel that it very important that I discuss with my medical provider everything that's going on with me and that helps me help the Dr.help me make better health discussion

0.866667	I can understand most medical information, but sometime I don't understand. If I don't understand what I'm reading or been told I'll ask about it.
0.838900	I think if the problems and information are simplified to a degree where it is easy enough to understand for someone who did not go to med school, I can understand pretty well all the information given to me. 
0.788900	I feel confident in my ability to understand most information presented, but I do sometimes avoid asking questions out of shyness and a fear of looking dumb. I do have friends I can ask though.

0.811100	I have strong capacity to understand what I'm being told, but I often lack the confidence to ask appropriate questions, thinking that they're either silly questions or that I already understand the information. More often than not, I'll think of a question as soon as I get in the car to get home. My mother worked in health care for a long time, so she is a valuable source of information for me if I need some help better understanding things. My wife is also there to answer questions and process information, though she is similar to me in that it takes some time to process questions.
0.805600	I just do

If not, I can always ask my doctor, who is very helpful. If my doctor is not available, sometimes I'll call my sister, who is a nurse and can often explain things better to me.l
0.833333	I ask my doctor to explain what she can and I go online to get medical website. I also took college courses before so I know some things already .

And I find that doctors and nurses typically do a good job of explaining things anyway, which makes my role easier.

If there is anything I don't understand about a condition I have the knowledge to search for the appropriate information and the mental capacity to sift through to gather correct information.  
0.527800	Sometimes its just hard to understand completely what they are trying to communicate and they make the forms so complicated to fill out it hinders my ability to express what is wrong or get the necessary information I'm going to need.
0.827800	I feel pretty confident researching my health conditions, evaluating study abstracts, and staying on top of new information. Sometimes I have a hard time talking with health care professiols, though. I think they're used to doing the same thing for everyone with a particular health condition and don't understand how my multiple conditions interact with each other. 
0.827800	I do feel that I have the ability to make appropriate decisions. If something is confusing, I may search for more information on the internet or ask people for their opinions/experience.

0.866667	As  long as the wording used is not intricate medical terminology I can usually understand  basic health information.
0.655600	I have often found that when receiving verbal information from doctors and nurses it's hard to understand. But that the written information is more simplified and often does not contain information I am looking for.

0.833333	I feel I can answer questions presented to you confidently. I use Internet to help get a visual on some issues.

0.872200	I am capable of understanding most medical information whether it is by reading or listening to a professiol.  I am confident that I understand what I am told and most remember to ask the important questions.
0.883300	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to know, after an appointment with a medical professional. If I do not understand something, I have no problem asking for more explanation. I never leave with unanswered questions or not understanding the information given to me.
0.772200	I have a background in healthcare and an optometry student. I had some experience volunteer and work in the hospital environment.
0.638900	It depends on the condition. For instance when I have a cold, medical care is easier to understand than when I am being seen for my thyroid.

Unfortunately It takes a great deal of effort to say what i need to say or understand what needs to be understood. Even now i am having difficulty because I am dirt poor. Like completely in the muds poor. I need help. Please help me. 
0.705556	well i fell as i know myself better than others so that why i could fill out medicail papers with no problem
0.833300	The problem is with the fact that the basic health information itself that is so dumbed-down it gets in the way of making appropriate decisions.  Health services are then rendered based off of the inadequate information.   There's never any mainstream knowledge given to the public to help them understand how to implement knowledge to help themselves from the ground up; a perfect example of this is with nascent iodine, which helps the thyroid which is the master gland of the body responsible for balancing all other organs.   Without nascent iodine, fluoride, intentionally put in drinking water overwhelms EVERYONE'S thyroid.  But from an allopathic perspective, 'if ain't broke and the test doesn't say so, don't fix it'.  The Rockefellers taking over medicine in the 1940's and helping create the modern version of allopathic medicine is disgusting!
0.850000	Well, if anything is confusing to me, I can just ask a doctor or a nurse. I can also use the vast internet to find answers to my questions as well as find people online to discuss medical issues/decisions that I might be faced with -- people who face the same things. I can seek advice from those people. For the most part, I am confident I can and do understand information relevant to my health.
0.777778	I feel I am more than able to understand medical information regarding myself. However, the ability to receive that information is non-existant. It's nearly impossible being low income and finding a General Practiciner of Medicine that you can trust to be truthful with your heal, as well as be truthful with. No one cares. Doctors don't care. They get their degree then stop doing their job before they even have one. They can't be trusted. So even when I do get the rare chance to receive medical information, it is usually false, biased, or worthless. They don't believe that I know what's best for my body, but that's becuase they don't care. They don't think that anyone that hasn't wasted 8 years of their life and over $200,000 could possibly know or understand anything. Their all arrogant, narcissistic, self-entitled failures. They. Don't. Care. 
0.872222	I feel like I have a very good capacity to obtain, process,  and understand basic health information because I studied majority of it in nursing school. 
0.900000	I feel very competent to voice my concerns and questions with my health care providers.   If I don't understand something I have no problems asking them to repeat or put in laymans terms so that I can understand better. 
0.861111	I feel comfortable with my primary care doctor and his staff. I feel I get good information from them all and my questions are answered 
0.638889	most of the time unless the information is told to family members in private on my behalf. reading the ingredients of medicine is confusing.
0.900000	Normally when I don't understand something that is hospital related, I do ask enough questions to help me understand what is going on. I also do some research online. 
0.788889	i feel i know what the doctor says . and if i have any questions i will ask and if i have any concerns i will express them to the doctor 
0.672200	I think that I can understand basic health decisions but more info on advantage illnesses when they occur or am told about them. I can gain more knowledge through them and the internet
0.900000	I have been diagnosed with a medical condition. I have had this condition for several years. It requires that I use medication and be seen by my doctor for examination approximately every six months. My doctor always asks questions re: any changes in my condition. I am able to respond to all questions and ask questions if needed.
0.833300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to process information and comprehend what is being told to me by a medical professional. If there is something I don't fully comprehend, I do not hesitate to ask the health professional for clarification on the issue and subsequent treatment. Based off my experiences, doctors have always been very good at clarifying certain points and re-wording things in a way that I can understand. There are also so many resources available now to people online which makes it easier for anyone to obtain basic knowledge and/or clarification on any health issues that might be occurring.

0.588900	I have training in in health field and I used to work in the hospital. I feel comfortable to help. 
0.722200	I think I have the ability to obtain a lot of information on the internet.  I can't obtain information from other people as much as from the internet because I'm not around people much especially medical people and because it's very difficult for me to think of everything if I'm talking to someone so sometimes I don't end up asking anything and sometimes I only ask one or two things that I've already thought a lot about.  I think I can usually understand information on the internet, though I think sometimes both the internet and doctors and nurses don't give much information because they don't think I need to know much.

0.811100	I feel pretty confident until I actually get to the Drs office - it can be overwhelming. Nerve racking. You forget what you want to say (i try to write things down) but also, it sometimes goes so fast that you forget or blank out.  It always helps when the Dr gives you pamplets, but those can also be either vague or way too much info or jargon.

I am very particular about my health care providers and will not stick with any doctor that does not explain things well or make information I need readily available and accessible to me.

0.827800	Basic health information is pretty straight forward in my opinion. The doctors and nurses do their jobs perfectly well, and help me as a patient understand my options, and whatever else seems to be going on. There could be some ways that hospitals could improve upon their services such as having online forms in order to fill out information before hand which would make it much easier to get serviced quickly. Most of the time I can understand, and process the diagnoses that I have been given, and with the help of online resources the doctors job is not as necessary to explain in detail if I don't understand something or have questions I can quickly look it up and if I am still confused I can contact my doctor in order for he she to clear things up for me.

0.900000	I feel that I have above average capacity to process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I have an educational background as a medical office assistant. 
0.916700	I feel like there is enough information available online that most people can do research and gather adequate information to make relatively accurate decisions regarding their health without consulting professionals.
0.900000	The person giving me the documents usually explains it very well, or can answer my questions about it. I can't recall having any big trouble understanding any health information that I've been given. 
0.794400	Generally I feel I can understand health information needed services.  I usually pester my doctor asking questions and even repeating them if I feel that is necessary.  Often, when I get home I will research information on medications and medical issues on the Internet if I do not fully understand them.  I will also ask my spouse as she is quite knowledgable about these things. 
0.833333	I somewhat have the capacity by using what I am told by my doctor, research online to help me understand some things I am not sure about and I ask the doctor for help also.
0.855600	I feel I am completely able to understand any thing I'm told by the doctor or nurse, and am able to all questions correctly to get the answers I need on the things I do not.  I usually do not have an troubles with any forms or reading I am supposed to fill out.
0.766700	I feel that overall I can make a good decisions. Sometimes things confuse me but I try and ask questions if they do. 
0.800000	I think I often don't even know the questions I need to ask and so that is why I feel like I miss out on knowing everything.
0.900000	I am well aware of the medical profession i can read the writing and are very alert of all information and health decision

0.872200	Due to my employment in health care, I feel that I have a decent grasp of medical terminology and pathology. I usually understand what a doctor or nurse is explaining, and if I don't I feel very comfortable asking questions. However, I do also feel somewhat complacent when being treated and tend to trust what they are doing and not question their decisions.
0.822200	I think that I would be able to retain as much information initially. If there was anything that seemed confusing I would then write it down for later so that I could research it myself to the best of my ability. However, before it would get to that point I would ask as many questions as I could.
0.716700	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand my health information by speaking with my doctors and their office assistants, including visits to specialists and labs. Details I may want to investigate are very often found online.  But when it comes to the fincial aspect of healthcare and health insurance I have often been confused and intimidated. The past several years have been much better with the help of the ACA and Covered California; but I am extremely worried that Republican legislation will end all that and allow insurance companies to focus on their profits instead of getting healthcare to those that need it.
0.872222	I feel I am intelligent enough to understand most of thew information they are explaining to come to a conclusion for an agreeable way to deal with my situation.
0.827800	I know that I can understand the information given to me, but it seems to be difficult to get that information in the first place. There aren't a lot of places that you can go to find dependable information for you to make your decisions. Hospitals and doctors are expensive to see and impossible to deal with if you are just needing information and websites can be confusing and misleading.
0.827800	I have all or most of the necessary abilities in terms of being able to understand what's being communicated to me. However, my issue is more that, sometimes, I do not seek medical advice because I have other priorities. Alternatively, I really value my privacy and might feel like I do not want others telling me how to act, regardless of their expertise. 
0.866700	My sister is a doctor of medicine, so in the rare occurrence where I have any lingering questions or doubts that my doctor wasn't able to answer adequately,  I ask for her input. For the most part I am able to understand basic health info, due to asking my doctor questions, reading the health info pamphlets or researching it online. 
0.855600	I'm not in the medical profession, so I can honestly say that I do need to have some medical information explained to me.

0.844400	I have, many times in the past, successfully read and understood numerous medical documents. This includes those that come from the emergency room, family doctor, specialists, nurses, and pharmacies. Sometimes I will even read about a condition on the internet to learn more. At one time I had to read things to my grandfather, but he has passed now.
0.833333	I have no known medical conditions but I am confident that I can understand any questions I may have.  I have some health concerns (eg smoking) but my inaction is a result of lack of motivation rather than limited understanding.
0.827800	I think that I am able to understand my medical issues more because I have studied biological sciences in college. However, I feel that doctors and nurses tend to only give one option for the issue and do not give further information about altertive treatments. I would have a difficult time making the decisions if I do not have this information.
0.916667	I have a medical background and can understand all papers presented to me by my doctor or a nurse when this occurs

0.688900	I can generally make my own health decisions. The issue comes when doctors and nurses do not have time to give me all the information I need. I can understand most things just fine but if I do not have all the information I want then I can't make a good decision.
0.855600	I feel I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Generally medical professionals are helpful in that regard, as if you ever have any questions, most are willing to explain it in detail. Also the age we live in, any questions about medical stuff are only a google search away. From the google search you can find actual medical documents explaining certain things, or just find other people like yourself suffering from the same thing who will share their experiences. Also not trying to brag but I've also been a smart person, so I find understanding things like this, isn't that tough. Generally though, I just try to make sure my Doctor and/or Nurses are fully informed of what is going on with me, and make sure to ask any questions I have.
0.916667	I AM FULLY COMPETENT TO COMPLETE MEDICAL FORMS, UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICIAN, AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. I CAN MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS.

0.555556	I make sure to explain everything that i need to in as much detail as possible so that they understand my issues and condition
0.811111	I think I generally do, however, sometimes I am not sure what to ask the doctor or they are in and out so fast I do not have time to process the information enough to ask the right questions.
0.916667	I feel I can obtain and understand health information myself. I have never needed assistance in this area.
0.850000	i understand sometime but when i dont i ask for more infor  or do reserach...........................................
0.916667	I am in good health physically and mentally.  I do not need help in any capacity, and I work 30 hours or more a week and need no assistance from anyone.
0.811111	I do not have a medical back round, but my wife, among other things was a practicing nurse...and if I am not clear on a medical issue, will discuss it with me...
0.672200	I feel I have the capacity to understand and retain most basic health information. It is harder to retain services as I live in America where health is expensive and hard for anyone that is not rich.
0.916700	I only have one body, one life in this world. I know that doctors are not fail-proof, so I ask all the questions I need to in order to make sure I am getting the best care possible. It helps that my husband is extremely interested in our overall health and can hold an informative conversation with doctors. It makes them take us much more seriously!
0.633300	I am pretty confident in my ability to comprehend medical information when it comes to conditions and medications and things like that. However, if it involves hospital procedures or insurance or technical information like that, I need either assistance or to read up information from several sources in order to make sure I actually understand what I'm reading.
0.844444	I can understand medical terminology and basic health issues. I understand most health procedures when explained to me.
0.350000	"I process written health information better because I can go over it a few times whereas with ""spoken"" information, I can't process it as easily. When it comes to obtaining and understanding everything else, I generally feel like I want someone to advise me or to be by my side, but it's not needed."
0.655600	I always feel comfortable when speaking to a medical professiol because they have seen many cases of my case. Whether I have allergies or anxiety, I talk to my doctor and tell him every step of pain or exhaustion I feel. I leave no stone un turned as I want the doctor's trust and help. 
0.916667	I feel very capable of answer and discussing all paperwork given to me by my physician I comprehend very very . When it comes to my health, I have no problem addressing the issues

0.816700	My family took care of my mother for 7 years before she died. I was the main caregiver. I learned that you must be proactive with your own health or anyone you're caring for. I know how to ask questions when I don't understand something. I know how to research it and gain the knowledge I need to feel comfortable with whatever it is I'm trying to understand.
0.794400	I feel that I am fully capable of asking questions surrounding my own healthcare. The problem is I can become embarrassed or shy while I'm trying to advocate for my needs and make sure that I get all the information that I need to. It's also hard for me when the doctor or a nurse is behind schedule or seems to be in a rush. If that's the case, then I'm almost afraid to ask a question because I don't want to get the brush-off. 
0.838900	I feel I have the appropriate resources to find the information if I dont understand it.  I could ask my doctor to explain, or I also have access to a medical hotline I can call for answers.  Worst case scerio I can look online for answers to my questions also.
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I try to be an informed consumer / patient when it comes to my health and do my best to take care of myself.  I try to learn as much as I can about health conditions I may have as well as the best ways to take care of myself.  I like to stay healthy and live as healthy a lifestyle as possible.
0.794400	I believe that I am confident enough to get through acquiring a health service. I do not have a ton of experience and sometimes the wording gets confusing. I think that usually though I will eventually get through it successfully. I've never had help filing my taxes and that usually goes pretty well.

0.688889	I feel like I can fill out most medical forms, with a help of some questions so I can understand exactly what they are asking, and I do not answer the wrong question the wrong way.
0.766667	yes i understand what to do when i need assistnace with any health  issues my doctors tend to my needs and i know when and what to ask for specific  issues
0.688889	I understand whatever my doctor tells me about my conditions, or I question until I understand everything she says.  I come to the doctor's office with a list of questions that I listed since the last time I saw my doctor.
0.916667	I feel that I have full 100% capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.738889	I normally have my mother, who is retired nurse of over 30 years, help me fill in paperwork and ask questions during my diagnosis.
0.916700	I believe I have a well developed capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, and to take advantage of services, where applicable, to make appropriate health decisions.  The problem for me is not one of being able to understand materials, issues, and choices, it is about making the best choice with the available information, which is sometimes lacking, ambiguous, disjointed, incomplete, or even biased and perhaps incorrect.   I frequently consult with other health professiols when forming judgments about health decisions, and almost always benefit in the long term from doing so.
0.916667	I can easily obtain and process all types of health information. I am well-versed in medical terminology.
0.788900	I have taken enough health related classes and done enough research to know the questions to ask.  I know the basics of how my body functions and reacts.  This knowledge helps me to communicate better with my health professionals and get the help that I need
0.916700	I am able to read and understand most materials given to me by doctors. My primary care doctor is very willing to get me more printed information if I request it and sometimes does it on his own.

0.455600	I don't feel as if I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information greatly. I constantly need help in understanding basic health information. 
0.494444	Now  it will  make my medican work and it will aways be the same thing and it will me a dlfew times away and it will be yltue same thing and it will never get hard to do thing to do with me and adhd and it away be the same thing
0.766667	Usually my spouse accompanies me and we sit together to talk to the MD, ask questions and ask details as much as we think of them.
0.655556	I think I have pretty good capacity but from time to time I might need some help. Like understand some medical terms or what exactly a paper work wants from me.

0.705600	I believe that I'm maybe average in terms of this type of basic health information processing, and how to understand it in order to make informed health decisions.  In the case of something that I don't understand from medical literature or perhaps something I hear a medical professional share, I would say I can obtain the information I need.  Its important to me to make the best decisions so I try to get information from different sources.
0.883333	I feel I have great capacity to obtain, process and understand health information and services in order to make health decisions. 
0.788900	I believe I have the willingness to learn all that I need to about my health and any appropriate measures that I could take to address any health issue I have. I'm willing to dig into details and be thorough about it.
0.727800	I feel that with the internet I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions- but that is done on my own time outside of the doctors office. I do not feel that health officials play a key role as more often than not they are rushed and not listening to concerns. If I or another family member are seeking diagnosis, I will give as much information as I know to have but can't say that I have the details or knowledge to know which specific questions to ask. As for documents pertaining to medical procedures or medical information they are often confusing and difficult to understand in the short time allotted. 
0.716667	I think I am moderately capable of understanding health imformation, but I may also need help with some questions because I've rarely been or spoken to a doctor.
0.800000	I feel like I am able to learn about my health as long as I ask the right questions. In the past some doctors have been non chalant, when it comes to the symptoms that bother me. 
0.716667	I'm very concern about my health and healthcare. And I watch what I eat some times I can walk and some days I can't walk at all

0.888889	I feel I have the full ability to obtain basic health information and understand how to make appropriate decisions for my healthy needs.
0.588900	I am just as smart as others. I understand just fine.
0.916700	I believe I have a high capacity to understand all basic medical information that's necessary. As long as I ask a lot of questions and make certain that the professiols explain things to me in simple words, I don't have any problems at all.
0.566667	I feel with my limited exspirance and novice knowledge, my level of medial understanding is minimal. 
0.755556	If I have a health condition I will take care of others with the medication I am prescribed with and if I don't understand it I'll ask the doctor about it or google about it. It's not that difficult so I'm pretty familiar with reading 
0.850000	I think that I possess the intellect to understand most basic information when it comes to medical information. Of course their are occasions when I am completing a form and I may have a question or not understand exactly what is being asked. Likewise the same may occur when speaking with a health professing, but I am fine with asking them for clarification. 
0.722200	Im open minded, and feel the need to question things, so I think I can usually dig as deep as i need to
0.916667	i will always ask questions about some thing the doctor says that i dont understand and he will explain it to me untill i do understand
0.900000	Entirely  I am a registered nurse educated in medicine and nursing a college degree with twenty years experience 
0.900000	I am adequately prepared to discuss my medical conditions with healthcare professionals. I have the ability to ascertain and properly comprehend basic health information. 
0.822200	I feel I have a high capacity in general regarding those questions. I ask so many questions of my Doctor he gets irritated, but I get my answers. :) I believe I understand basic health information, and if I don't there are people I can ask - and an entire internet to search - for answers. Sometimes the official forms are intimidating. I try to take all forms slow and question what I don't understand.
0.866667	I feel I am pretty capable, but my memory is not what it used to be. My fibromyalgia also affects my memory and comprehension, so I like to have someone along with me at Dr appointments to listen with me. Then we can talk later and make sure I heard it all. I sometimes forget the dates of all the procedures and surgeries I have had when filling out forms, so it's nice when the computer system  has those things already in it. 
0.744400	I think sometimes I struggle to communicate verbally---like in person, I don't do a good job of explaining things. I also tend to panic and forget everything I was going to say, which means that sometimes I have follow up questions and stuff, that just don't get answered if I didn't write them down before hand. 
0.866667	I have a wide range of medial knowledge due to self research and I also have several family members in the medical field. I have also always excelled in reading comprehension so it's rare that I don't understand what I read. Lastly, I'm not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something.
0.916700	I feel very capable of doing these things. I feel confidednt in my ability to obtain and understand information about my health care. I feel that I am able to trust my own reasoning and decision making. 
0.727778	I talk to family, research diagnosis's online, go over doctor recommendations, etc. I also research alternative methods of healing.  
0.822200	I have an extensive medical history going back more than 20 years. Throughout that time I have been in situations that called for requests of my medical records and other related transcripts of my care. I also have been in need of more materials for my own understanding, as I have had more than 10 surgeries over the years and many procedures.  I have fulfilled the requests(for legal and Disability reasons) and supplied myself with what I needed too. I was in touch with anyone and everyone including, records department employees, APRNs, to people that are part of national health help organizations to the doctors themselves in order to obtain what I needed to get.
0.688900	I feel like I understand most of what is told to me regarding health information but sometimes I need help.  I rarely go to the doctor or get sick so I am not familiar with a lot of medical terminology or how processes work so I usually have to get either my wife or mother to help me understand things.  I usually consult someone if there is a big decision to make although that is extremely rare.
0.866700	I feel I have a good ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information so I can make health decisions. I have never run into a problem at my doctor's office or medical facility where I was confused about any particular thing.
0.805600	I think that I can understand basic health information.  If I don't understand something, I usuallyl ask.  Although sometimes its hard to keep up with everything the doctor or person on the phone is saying   
0.900000	I believe I am well qualified to obtain process and understand basic health information because I do it regularly
0.538900	i do not feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision because it is impossible to see a doctor these days. Moreover, once you actually see a doctor, they charge you out the wazoo. So there's this incentive not to go see a doctor. If i can't see a doctor, because i can't afford it. Then it's impossible to obtain/process/understand basic health information. Health care in the US is so broken. And trump is making it worse.
0.827800	Overall I would say that my capacity for understanding and processing basic health information is very good.  I find the reading material easy to understand, if I have questions I can usually ask the nurse or doctor at the time of my appointment.  I also can look online for questions regarding my condition.
0.688889	I am very capable of making my own health decisions related to my medical care and make sure that I choose the best quality care that my insurance will cover
0.500000	I feel like I don't have the capacity to process basic health information because it was never explained to me in detail about the meaning of each medical word.If I was explained some medical terms I would better understand them
0.866700	I feel like I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. The health professionals I've always had ask me if I don't understand something. I can also call them if I have questions later on.
0.611100	I try to remember and understand everything. I try to listen well and ask the right questions. If I can I will take a friend with me to help me to remember things.
0.844400	I feel confident. I have an understanding of the condition and the medical staff is helpful.
0.672200	I have general familiarity of general, basic medical terms, however, I don't feel great about filling out forms. I tend to overthink them and am always concerned that I'm going to fill something out wrong, and have it negatively impact me in the future. 
0.794444	Faily well. Maybe somewhat better than average as I have worked in medical field. I understand most of what I ingest.
0.916667	I have good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services and don't usually need help understanding them.

0.872222	I feel like I have great heathcare professionals and access to information so that I fully understand conditions and am able to make informed decisions regarding them.
0.716667	I'm not really sure what this survey is asking. It just seems to be be asking the same thing or and over again.
0.883300	Because of a disease I was diagnosed with over 20 years ago, I've learned a lot of terminology related to medical health.  I'm not afraid to ask my doctors questions or for thorough explations if necessary.  It's been my experience that doctors are always very willing to take the time to explain. My husband has EMT training and his knowledge helps sometimes.
0.794444	I nelieve i am able to understand and comprehend eveytjing i read and i ask questions if i dont understand
0.700000	I can read, but I have more difficulties in focusing on them. I have a learning disability, which is a disorder that sometimes affects my concentration.
0.738889	I have about 90 percent knowledge of what my doctors/nurse explain to me. If I do not understand any thing that is explain to me, I have my daughter or son to give me more information. The next time I visit my doctor I will make sure that it is correct.
0.772200	i pretty strongly believe i have the capacity to do the above. i know how to contact my insurance agency, but do also sometimes rely on my parents to assist
0.916700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain any information that I need. I'm not afraid to ask when I have questions and I have healthcare providers that are willing to explain things to me as many time as they need to.

0.755600	"I feel I have the capacity to do these things but I don't always have the resources or the confidence to do them. So, it isn't a certainty that I can find a specialist who can provide me the ""right"" answers to my questions. I don't always ask enough follow-up questions, in my opinion, as I don't want to take up too much of the health provider's time."
0.738889	I feel that I am capable of reading and understanding medical documents pertaining to my health condition. I try to stay knowledgeable about my medical condition by researching them on my own time.

0.555600	I always feel when I go to my doctor that they really do not seem to care about what is going on with me, therefore they do not really explain all the details on what I need to do t make my condition better. Or they just give me the run of the mill answer, not really getting to the root of the problem.
0.883300	I have no trouble obtaining and understanding health information, generally. The exception to that is if a doctor starts rattling off scientific medical terminology that I'm not familiar with, or if they reference drug mes I don't know. Reading material isn't an issue because I can always look something up if I don't understand it.
0.888900	I am able to read and understand my medical information.  I can listen to the Doctors and comprehend and set up follow up care. I someitmes forget to mention everything that I am supposed to about my condition to them

0.611100	I have the capacity to understand basic health information, but it is never explained to me very well by my doctor and his nurses.  They generally never take the time to fully answer my questions and when they do its very technical and hard to understand and they won't help me.

0.616700	 I withhold information that I believe will be used against me or give the doctor the idea to refer me to other doctors because that is a slippery slope.  Medical staff do not have time to answer your questions.  They go by textbook and give answers without having examined you or checked your history.  I don't trust medical staff.
0.583333	I believe that most of the times im able to understand basic health information. However sometimes a letter is too confucpsing and I need more help to explain it.
0.838900	I have learned with age to ask questions. If i do not understand something I'm not afraid to speak up. I have also learned it is good to get a second opinion.  I have had instances where my PCP misdiagnosed certain conditions. 
0.861111	I am very comfortable in my understanding of health issues and my ability to make important decisions.
0.883333	I consider myself very qualified to understand the information presented to me by a doctor and to make good decisions based on the information I get from the doctors and information I can get from other sources. People often ask me to clarify the information they receive from their doctors. 
0.916667	I understand it all. I always ask questions of my doctor so that I know what is going on with my health.
0.805556	I understand reading and filling out forms when I go to a dr. Appointment I usually don't have issues.
0.788900	When it comes to basic health information and services I am fairly confident in my ability to handle everything myself without issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate myself around 7 or 8, where 10 means fully confident.
0.900000	i worked in a doctors office for 20 years so I pretty much know a lot of things I need to ask the doctor about.  I know how to fill out all the forms and I know all about insurance forms.  I am not saying I know everything, but I do know enough to be able to do it by myself
0.772200	I usually am able to follow what I am being told in regards to the medical information given to me, however, there have been times when I needed more information and did not ask for it. I would get flustered by them trying to hurry me up or hurry me out of the office that I forget what I wanted or needed to ask. 
0.850000	I feel like I have the proper amount of capacity to fill out and obtain any and all health information and services that I need to make appropriate health decisions. I make sure that I'm always asking my doctors questions about my health and trying to understand completely what it is that's going on with me or what it is that I'm being diagnosed with. I always make sure that the doctors are explaining things thoroughly and if I feel like I need more information about something, I'll make sure that I'm asking them to try and explain things a little bit better to me.
0.738889	I feel that I understand most things that my doctor tells me. There are sometimes he says things that I don't understand, but I usually can figure it out
0.822200	I feel like it is completely within my capacity to obtain basic health information and services. However, it is a bit more difficult to always process and understand that information. I feel like the last few times I saw a doctor, the appointment was extremely rushed, and did not allow me the time to ask all of the questions I had about the information I'd received at those appointments. My doctor gave me print-outs, which were a little helpful, but felt like a lazy way of ensuring that I was provided with the information I needed. I ended up having to do online searches at home to fully understand everything that was discussed at my appointments.
0.733300	I think I can understand the information well enough to get by but there are times I don't understand what doctors verbally explain to me. I'm not great at asking for clarification either.
0.883300	I think when it comes to making decisions about my health, I feel that I'm fully capable of interpreting what the doctor's are saying and asking a lot of questions.  I tend to ask about alternatives to treatments depending on what the recommendations are.  I tend to trust what my doctor's say because I have a long standing history with them and they have a proven track record of having positive recommendations.  Any literary information I receive I'm fully capable of reading and understanding and usually do additional research myself.  The only thing I do is I have my husband take care of understanding the side effects of my medication so I don't get super anxious and dwell about the side effects.  I just let him know if I start feeling weird. I also make most of my decisions with my husband so that I have a support system.

0.744400	I think I am capable but hesitant when it comes to gathering health information. I can definitely do it but I am unsure because of the frequency in which I actually make use of certain information.
0.750000	I feel like I am in a good position to do these things, but that is because I am somewhat intelligent. I feel like healthcare professionals are open to answering any questions that I may have and willing to do so in terms that I can understand. The only thing that I am not confident in is my ability to obtain all the information I need. Sometimes I am confused about where to go to obtain information.
0.633300	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. The reason for this is that I can usually understand and process basic information, but when it comes to things such as specific terms or words I do not understand them which causes me to not understand more things. I sometimes also do not ask all of the questions I should  if I do not fully understand something. 
0.900000	To the full degree.  That is assuming the doctor is giving me all of the information.
0.916667	I am fully capable of doing so, I have a good understanding on how to obtain the information, where to obtain it and how to process the information I have gathered, as well as applying any information pertaining to my health.

0.783300	I feel even though my mom never took me to doctors, unless the schools made her, that I have a fair understanding of medical information. This is partially because health classes in school and getting pregnt as a teeger. When I was pregnt I did all the doctor stuff alone. Plus in my crappy college I took atomy and microbiology.

0.766700	I think I have the basic knowledge and understanding to feel fairly competent in comprehending my health situations. I know where to find the resources to make decisions if I need. I could probably be more thorough in my discussion, explanations, and and questioning of health professionals to ensure the highest level of efficient care. I probably make too many assumptions.
0.833333	I feel I have full capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information. do not know what else to type
0.588900	The best formula for making health decisions is to combine the most reliable medical facts with our persol values. These include our beliefs, fears, lifestyle, and experiences, and they all play a role in helping us make decisions about our health.
0.888900	When I go to the doctor, I prepare for what I want to know about whatever it is that I am experiencing.  I write down symptoms having, blood pressure taken at home, and any questions I have.

0.577800	If you are like most people, you have opportunities to initiate difficult conversations on a frequent basis, but they probably donât really feel like âopportunitiesâ,  we are using the term âdifficult conversationsâ to convey a situation where both parties in the conversation need to stay in a relationship, the stakes are high, opinions vary and emotions may run strong. At work, situations may arise between you and your supervisor that call for you to initiate a difficult conversation. Your supervisor may be many things, but it is doubtful s/he is a mind-reader.

0.616700	I have a great support system in my wife who is a Pediatric ED nurse who I lean on for explations and understanding of complex medical terms and situations.
0.866700	Intellectually, I can understand the pieces of information that I am given, but we often don't hear or learn enough about the health system for me to understand everything (especially regarding insurance)
0.705556	I understand what I need to and if I need help there's always someone to help me.. But when I go to the doctors office usually its every other week I take someone with me who will also be able to help me if I need it..
0.672200	I feel like I have the capacity to do all of the things listed. My biggest problem is remembering the specifics of what is told to me. I need to take notes to keep track of everything that is told to me.

0.683300	There are times where I am unsure of exactly what the forms are asking. I feel like doctors talk too fast at times trying to explain and then rush out to the next patient. I have a general understanding and feel like I can figure out how to get health information or assertive enough to ask for help. 
0.816667	I feel as though I have a decent amount of knowledge to understand health information and make appropriate health decisions. I definitely think the internet makes it easier to understand these matters.

0.672222	I have the ability to read and obtain all the necessary information in these questions you are asking. 
0.538900	It all depends on the circumstances. Some things are just harder than others to understand. I don't like doctors to begin with, they seem to cause a denial for me if something is wrong.
0.872200	I can make sense of most of what is being told. I know what the forms mean when I fill them out.  I have a general understanding of all the information given to me.
0.916700	I am capable to understand basic health information.  I have to deal with it with my parents, with someone I took care of and a friend.  I can also find out information on the computer when needed for basic health information.  I also have a cousin and a friend who are nurses but I did work in the medical field for about a year.
0.688900	I think I only know the basic stuff that every average citizen knows.  I'm not a medical professional and I don't know much research my conditions or anything I have problems with.

0.538900	I can understand basic health information regarding my diagnosis. I can obtain a basis understanding from pamphlets that I've received from the doctor regarding my specific medical condition. The dialogue between the doctor and I usually does not go further than this because of very limited time constraints. When they had my info over to a staff after a 3 minute discussion, it brings me to square one because the nurses usually aren't there during that part of the conversation.
0.583333	I am not a Doctor nor a nurse but from my understanding you don't need to go to school to know your body. I do feel like i can understand basic health information 
0.833333	I understand everything completely the basic health information and the service needed to make appropriate health decisions 
0.883300	I feel as if I do possess the capacity to obtain all the information that I need. Not only can I refer to the internet, but when I do make trips to the doctor, I have the ability to ask questions and I'm not shy about feeling potentially stupid. After all, this is my health we're talking about here! 
0.744400	I think i have somewhat of a decent grasp of what I need to do with the information I receive for the most part. However, there are times when I'm left puzzled by certain information and a doctor isn't always available to answer my questions.
0.850000	I feel very equipped to make appropriate health decisions and obtain the information. I always try to describe my medical information thoroughly and always ask for things to be clarified if need be. The medical staff at the health facilities I've been to have always been incredibly helpful and accessible.
0.900000	I have done always done this for myself and continue to do so.  I visit my doctors' at least 5 times a year and I explain conditions and understand medical information for all of them.
0.872200	I feel that I am well-enough informed to communicate what is needed. I always turn to reference materials if need be....especially on medications. I am rarely given new prescriptions but when they are filled there is ample information given at the time of purchase.
0.916700	I feel like anything I don't understand that's given to me by a doctor or nurse would be easily understood after they explain it to me. If I didn't understand it then I would simply ask and that should be enough.
0.772200	I feel like for the most part I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  Sometimes it can be overwhelming though.  And sometimes it seems some information can be conflicting.

0.750000	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Generally I can understand most things but sometimes I might need help for the more complicated issues.
0.744400	Most times when I go to the Doctor I have to get the Doctor or a nurse to go over any and all paperwork, so I will completely understand all directions from the Doctor.  My health is very important to me and I do not want to leave the office confused about anything that the Doctor has said.
0.705556	As far as general health goes, I do believe that I know and understand what is expected to maintain good health. For more complex issues, I may need to contact a provider
0.777778	I feel completely capable doing this and anticipate no real issues with understanding such information 
0.844444	As long as I can back up the information initially provided to me by the nurse or doctor with additional research via current internet resources such as PUBMED, WEBMD, Consumer edition of the PDR, Consumer edition of the MERCK MANUAL, and any other disease/drug specific resources I believe are appropriate (e.g. American Heart Association, American Cancer Association, Susan G. Koman Breast Cancer Foundation, Parkinson's Disease Foundation), I am comfortable making the appropriate health decisions on my own.
0.761100	I feel it to a moderate degree. When in doubt, I usually consult with my sister, who is a nurse practitioner. 
0.538900	I think I have a moderate capacity to do this. I think that they use a lot of difficult terms, and that is where the misunderstanding come from.
0.588889	I currently going to school for my Healthcare Management degree at UAB this helps me understand health information a bit more then others
0.833300	I'm a college educated middle-aged man.  I do not have a background in the sciences other than basic classes.  I feel that I can understand consumer level medical information.  But when I hear lipid counts, or other medical tests/jargon, I start to glaze over, honestly. 
0.916700	I have complete capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic and complicated health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions.  I have a background in competitive athletics and know what to look for and listen for with injuries, and my academic schooling is such that I have a good understanding of science, biology, and the way such things work.
0.861100	This is all just basic common sense and intelligence which most people have the capacity to perform, unless mentally challenged due to age or a mental defect, or if a small child.
0.861111	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916667	I am of sound mind and body and I am able to understand and make important health information and services decisions by myself. I am capable of researching medical information, dissecting data, and making appropriate and timely decisions. As a former medical billing specialist and office manager, I have extensive knowledge and experience with the medical billing field. 
0.850000	I have the capacity, but sometimes I'm in too much pain to be able to process everything I'm being told.  And doctors don't always tell you what you need to know.  Or they mislead you and talk you into things, including surgeries, that you wish you hadn't agreed to later.  (That's happened to me more than once.)
0.438889	I don't understand the question.  You are going to have to rephrase the question because I'm not too savy on the subject.
0.916667	i fully understand all that is said to me.I have no mental deficiancys or comprehension problems.I understand basic information needed to make appropriate decisions.

0.866667	I feel very confident i can obtain and process and understand all basic health info to be able to make informed decisions.  Have no problems with this at all.
0.888889	I am extremely capable of understanding, obtaining and making health decisions for myself and my family. 
0.655600	I always question everything, i do this so that i can learn. Whether it is about a recipe or a law or my own health care. I get the information from the doctor and than will do my own research. I research every pill that is given me because i want to know exactly what i'm taking and the effects from it.
0.688900	 I do not feel like I am adequately prepared to deal with a health issue. The facilities near me are very bad and most people I know refuse to go to them in anything short of an emergency. The one time I went they told me to drink some tea and use Nyquil. They charged me $350 for that information. I asked numerous questions and the doctor just didn't them and seemed more interested in getting me out of there. From that experience I took it upon myself to start researching  and learning what questions to ask and where to go that would provide adequate healthcare. The internet is great source of information and I feel I have benefited greatly from using it for answering some minor medical questions. 
0.861111	I usually do research on health issues and get answers to questions that I am not sure about. I currently make all the health decisions for my three children and am aware of the conditions from a simple explanation from the doctors before making decisions.

0.827800	It seems that most medical professiols are really good at explaining things simply right from the start. At times, I really wish they would be more detailed but most are too rushed. In the few times I get any sort of information in writing, I will save it even after reading it to be sure I have a record. I think most information is pretty straight forward.

0.783300	An average person does have difficulty filling out medical forms. I am only knowledgeable in this due to the fact that I have an associates degree in medical billing and coding. I often need to help patients fill out their forms on a regular basis. Some of the forms are very hard for a person to understand. I myself have not yet figured out why the forms can not be written in plain text that patients can easily understand.

0.783300	I have a great capability to read and understand. Now if it is a medical condition I never heard of I would need a lot of additional information
0.794400	For the most part, I feel like I can obtain and understand the information. I do get overwhelmed by the decision making process.

0.794400	I have filled out medical paperwork and also have had times when I didn't understand something.

I definitely feel capable of understanding basic health information to make health decisions on my behalf.
0.833300	I don't have problems reading or understanding the information given to me by health practitioners. Sometimes I may read up on a condition etc on the internet for a better understanding if I still need more answers. 
0.661100	Persolly, I have taken some college courses toward my medical assisting degree so I am able to understand some of what my health professiols are talking about but anything I do not understand I make sure to look up and read more information from trusted websites or ask someone I trust and know.

0.883300	i have full capacity to do this. i'm not afraid to ask questions and am proactive.
0.805600	I feel that I have the same level of understanding of the medical system as the average person. A lot of things that are written or said by doctors are in their own language, and they sometimes forget that they need to put things in normal terms for people to understand them.

0.661100	I would imagine that I would grasp and understand most of the basic information. Some topics might include information that goes over my head. I might need further explanation on some issues.

0.822200	"I am a relatively intelligent person so I'm confident in my ability to process information in general. The problem arises when medical terminology is used and not explained. This is particularly true of lab tests where I may be told ""X is high"", but not told why that is or what that means for my overall health. I have a chronic health condition that I had to read the medical literature on myself because doctors never explained things. "
0.883333	Yes I feel that I'm in right state of mind to understand and comphend. The things the doctor says that's wrong with me.
0.727800	Health information is so important that sometimes it may be overthought of something too simple. However, in most cases there are times where I do need help in regards to medical forms that need to be filled out of have questions for the doctor. therefore, a lot of questions that can be given in a written format may require too much of a distinct jargon that couldn't be understand. Making the right health deicisons are important especially if it medical history in your family such as diabetes,  high blood pressure, and other health risk. it is always right seek out the best information. 
0.888889	Because I have been managing several chronic conditions for over many years, I have become quite familiar with dealing with medical staff and medical documents.

0.900000	I have a degree in Health Information Management. This has provided me with a thorough understanding of medical terminology and concepts. If i encounter something that i am not familiar with i at least have the capacity to find the answers i need.
0.616700	I feel as if I could use more help understanding basic health information and services. I don't know how to fill out certain health documents and having someone to help me id easier. There for I feel like I don't have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services so I'm not able to make an appropriate health decision for my self unless I have some help.
0.738889	To some degree I feel I have the capacity to understand my health information & service needs to make the right decision about my health because my doctor sends my blood work in  the mail so I try to understand to the best of my knowledge about what I need to do to get my numbers down if it show they are to high
0.750000	i am extremely adequate in answering and understanding questions and fillining out forms.I need no help at all;
0.888900	I am pretty confident with reading medical materials I constantly freeze proof read every documents and ask a lot of questions anything I don't understand I always Google it
0.794400	I feel that I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand different basic health information. Most of the hospital staff that have helped me in my lifetime have done a great job at explaining things to me. Almost all have been attentive and gone into further detail when I inquired about further explanation or detail. 
0.827800	The processing and understanding are rarely an issue, it's really about getting the information I need to do these things that is the problem.  Usually when I go to the doctor I am a bit stressed so I forget to ask pertinent questions.  Then realize it after leaving.  When I get home I often try to call them but rarely get a response right away.  I most often times find what I need on the internet. Days later I will get a response from the doctors nurse.
0.883333	I read all the materials and asks questions of my doctors to make sure I understand what they are telling me so I can fully understand what they are saying.
0.777800	I feel I know just as much as the regular ordiry person does in regard to medical questions, and paperwork. I know sometimes questions aren't asked due to worrying about feeling dumb about something.

0.872222	I have a pretty general understanding of certain disease and illnesses.  If I need assistance, I am prepared to ask for it.
0.733300	After a conversation with a dr, nurse or pharmacist, I usually fee that I have all the avenues I need to obtain and understand my basic health information. Most of the time any paperwork that's given to me I will review with one of the aforementioned people to better help me understand the medical terms.
0.883300	I feel very confident in my ability to understand medical information.  I have never had a problem doing this task in the past and would not anticipate having it in the future either.  I have taken some basic health classes and have a good general idea of the medical field, including insurance, etc...
0.827778	I think I can obtain, process and understand this information to a high degree. I do not have a problem understand questions that my doctor asks me. 
0.900000	I definitely have the ability to make appropriate health decisions. I am very proactive with my health, and I try to keep notes of questions or concerns I have when I go to the doctor. I also am not afraid to ask questions or ask for help if I need it. I do not want to be in a situation where I am not confident in my diagnosis or treatment.
0.883300	I was a health advocate for my mother so I have some basic understanding on health care and services. When I do not understand something I ask additional questions or look the information up online to understand the verbiage.
0.850000	I can do some things on my own, some others I need help with. It's not always that I could understand medical terms and instructions but I try my best. I access websites, contact my doctor, ask my family, and I just try to be patient when dealing with information.
0.572222	I believe that I must have the complete information from my doctor and the medical staff who assist me. Also I should have the opinion of my family to make a decision
0.900000	I am very confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand the basic healthy information
0.594444	I HAVE A LIMITED CAPACITY SOMETIMES IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE FORMS WANT, OR IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION
0.822200	I feel that I get the information that I need from either the doctors I see or their assistants.  If I have questions about prescriptions I talk to my pharmacist, I usually get more complete information from her than the doctor on medications.  The internet has also been helpful in making decisions about my health care, in knowing which questions to ask of the doctor or hospital personnel.  I try to be very informed when it comes to surgeries or medications that are prescribed to me.  I learn best by reading, our local health care professionals are good about asking the best way that a person learns things so that they can accommodate everyone.  we are very fortunate in our health care for the rural area that we live in.    
0.622200	I think i have a pretty good understaning of how to translate medical materials from a dr point of view to that of an average joes point of veiw without much of an issue.
0.794444	Im most definitely know the basics. Its common sense once explained. I would say that im at mid above mid level when it comes to the basics.

0.805600	I understand basic heath information as I have had issues before and make sure I know and understand what I need to know.
0.916667	I feel very capable. I have some basic medical training, and will research anything that I am curios about before I visit the doctor.
0.805556	Very knowledgeable. I have worked in the healthcare industry before so I saw a lot of examples and asked many questions about different diseases and medications
0.816700	I think it depends on the reasons why i'm in the hospital. If it is just a regular check up i usually don't have any problems understanding basic health information. Few month ago i had some issues with my stomach and because i'm not very educated in that sphere i needed more help of the nurse to understand what was wrong with me and why i needed to take the test that i was asked to do 
0.611111	To a certain degree I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions , if it is broken down into terms and words that I can understand and pronounce, but if it is something that is not broken down into terms and words that I cannot pronounce I do not understand the basic information I need to make important health decisions and services, it has to be clear and understandable
0.583300	I am not fully qualified to analyze in depth about the medical topic, but I am able to understand and analyze many basic things about medicine. I have learned all these things throughout my life while I care for other people or even, I learn it when I take care of myself. That's why I consider that I can understand the things that will be discussed in this survey
0.827778	I feel I have adequate knowledge and resources to be provided the information I need. Since I am going , I feel I am able to process and obtain health documents and information that I need for everyday living. If not, I have a great support system to assist me with what I am unsure of. 
0.866667	I feel  I have the capacity because most things I don't know about I look them up and find out so I know what I'm doing 
0.833333	I feel as if I could understand basic health information is the doctor is providing me with the information clearly and if the doctor explains it completley
0.538900	It's pretty good, I don't think I need too much help. It's fine.
0.916667	I am extremely capable of understanding, processing and obtaining basic health information and services.
0.666700	I think i have a fair degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I feel that i am old enough to make decisions on my own and i believe and trust in God in everything i do and decide.
0.733333	I feel like i am in a very good position right now with my mental health and physical health. I also feel like I am in a good place to be able to get any sort of help from any doctor near me in case of an emergency or if I just need help.  I am glad that I am in the current situation that I am in because if I wasn't i would be kind of sad and have a hard time with life.
0.783333	The questions asked brought up many situations where understanding healthcare is very important. You need to know how to obtain questions.
0.866667	I am confident that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand. If there ever came a time were I did not feel confident, I would seek help from a trained professional to get a clearer understanding.
0.916667	I am extremely confident that I can answer any and all questions pertaining to my healthcare.My ability to communicate makes me sure that I can make all the necessary decisions needed. 
0.755556	I feel I have a great capacity to obtain and process health information.  I'm a very heathly itellegent person
0.916667	At this stage, I am totally comfortable. This might change in the next few years, however, as my short-term memory is slipping a tiny bit.
0.872200	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand information to make health decisions.  If I don't understand something, I usually ask the doctor to further explain, and if I have more questions after I leave the doctor, I will do further research on my own.  I have done this in regards to my children's and my husband's health as well as my parents health concerns to further understand their problems.
0.900000	I feel that I understand basic health information and services very well. I have family that worked in hospitals so I have grown up with the language
0.655600	I would say for most basic health related information and services, I can grasp it if I take time to read through it and have a way to ask questions if needed.
0.850000	i have the pretty much capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions....
0.844400	Regarding all the questions I just answered, I feel that I have a very high comprehension level to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate Health decisions
0.900000	I read voraciously. I am in the insurance field and feel up to date on coverages. I was a an er tech in the service with a pharmacy background. My daughter is the CFO at our hospital.
0.900000	I think to a high degree. Not only am I assertive about getting information from the health professionals that I deal with but I have the greatest library on earth, the internet, at my fingertips. In addition I am a very good reader, so I am rarely confused by written information.
0.916667	I comprehend very well when information is presented to me, especially about my health. If there's is something I don't understand, I will always ask to clarify what was said.
0.844400	I feel rather confident in my ability to gather and interpret health information. I am mostly confident in making the right decision, although at times I gather too much information, and often that information contracdicts one another ad then I feel like I am in a spat where I feel less confident. 
0.916700	I believe at this point in time, health information is there if you are willing to seek it out. The web is ever expanding in regards to the information available, health provider apps are becoming more robust, and I happen to work at a call center (Carenet) that works to fill gaps in the consumer healthcare experience through providing various health provider services. However, for most people, I believe they are somewhat in the dark. The doctor's offices I've always been too do a terrible job of providing knowledge unless it's a doctor trying to prove they know the jargon. Clerical staff usually seem to avoid customers at any cost and ironically have terrible customer service (for the most part). Most offices have the same 30 year old graphics of the inner ear workings alongside  numerous posters advertising designer drugs. It'd be nicer if doctors offices were part medical care, part personal medical library. Plus, nobody really likes to reach out for health/insurance related information. I think it takes the external people who have a stake in that persons health (insurance providers) reaching out with info and care plans.
0.827800	I feel I'm very capable of understanding documents in general because I read them frequently for work. Reading health documents is a little more complex but the basic idea is still the same. I can easily search online for credible information and get a variety of views on what is best for me.
0.888889	I have full function and a higher education. I have no problems inquiring about medication or symptoms form any medical doctor/nurse/or assistant. I can fill out any forms (in English) and I am fully able to understand what I am reading.
0.900000	I think I can fully understand medical information and services that are needed. I always ask the necessary questions to understand the information if needed. 
0.800000	I feel very confident in understanding the science of medications and medical problems. However, insurances deliberately try to make forms, processes and procedures difficult for the patient and medical professionals in order to avoid paying. The fear of being stuck with the bill is enough to deter me and most others from seeking medical attention. 
0.850000	I went to school for CNA and took some classes on Microbiology. That gave me a curiosity so I got some books and learned quite a bit on my own. I ask questions and follow directions. So I can understand my health better
0.866700	I am disabled right now and have had health problems so I'm not working but I am a Registered Nurse.  The health care world has changed in the past 5 years so some of the questions have changed and it seems to be more difficult to get the time and answers needed from health care professionals. I usually have the knowledge to obtain, process and understand basic health information and usually am able to obtain services needed.
0.916700	I am able to read material with no problem, and I always ask questions for clarification when talking with a nurse or doctor.
0.650000	I can understand health information very confidently. I know what a lot medical terms mean 
0.916667	I do quite well with basic health information and do not need assistance.  The information I provide has been very successful in getting me effective medical help. 
0.600000	Health information can be very confusing. They do not always write the information so that an average person can understand it. Many times, I have to ask what the long medical terms mean, then I feel stupid. It can get scary, causing even more questions that are hard to understand. Having the internet so handy now does help with searching, but then you find other information that is really scary. 
0.638900	I think I can handle it with a little help, there is always the option to ask for help, specially from the doctors and nurses, and based on all the info I can take an appropriate health decision.
0.883300	i feel that i have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. if i do not understand then i make sure that i ask enough questions until i do understand. i have never had a problem with getting the information that i need regarding my health.
0.916667	I can easily fill out and understand any document, I need to fill out. And understand what I am reading
0.838900	I feel confident in making decisions as well as asking questions of my doctors about any and all items related to my health.  I believe I feel this way due to the fact that I was caregiver for both my parents and had to learn what and how to ask questions early on.  Given that I had over 15 years of experience with my parents and their doctors it gives me the confidence that I need now to take care of myself when needed and to ask the questions that I feel I need to have answered.  
0.783300	I can easily see that I am able to obtain health information from my doctor. I would be able to process the information that I was given and if I'm not able to understand it all, then I can ask the doctor to explain it more simpler.
0.850000	i have a lot capacity because i work in that field. im very knowledgeable about alot of things. i dont know why this has to be so long 
0.916700	I am confident in my capacity to effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.672200	I feel like I have an above average understanding of medical terms and technology, although I'm not in med school or anything.  I feel that a lot of the information available assumes that we are doctors and isn't really put into terms that the typical person can understand.  Some information is missing too, like how nasal steroids can cause dependence and shouldn't be used for more than a week or two.  These spurts of missing information can lead to very misinformed decisions.  I feel like the medical community could provide better resources.
0.883300	In general, I have the capacity I need to make appropriate health decisions. I have resources available to obtain further information and the general knowledge to process it.
0.777800	Very well. If it's broken down in layman's terms I understand
0.794444	I believe I can obtain,process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.866700	I feel that my capacity extends as far as what I feel comfortable with. These health questions and decisions, I feel, are rarely out of someone with a normal high school education's capacity to handle. I feel that if the health decision is not to the best of my judgment, then I will seek the appropriate health professional. I also feel that most health care professionals would take the time to better explain to their patients, if there was some kind of misunderstanding. This would in turn lead to a more patient/doctor trustworthiness, which would benefit the overall performance of the hospital.
0.783333	I can understand basic health information and services and obtain and process the information. I can make appropriate health decisions.
0.888900	I feel like I do. I have learned through the years to be very direct with people in the medical profession. I frankly don't trust anyone but the doctors and the nurses, and they start out as suspect. Any civilian working for the hospital is to be treated with zero trust whatsoever.
0.900000	I believe that I have a high degree of ability to obtain, process, and understand the information that I need to make the best health decisions for myself. I read a lot and have a great interest in the subject of health, so doing this is nothing new for me.
0.827778	I understand the medical procedures that may be necessary for me but sometimes I don't understand why. For example, there is one procedure in particular that I need to get but I really don't understand why I need it.

So, I may need to get advice from the doctor or someone around me to help me understand, exactly what the papers are saying.
0.850000	I feel that I am highly capable of obtaining the help I need to make appropriate health decisions. When I pick physicians I look for ones that are personable and beyond willing to make me fell comfortable. All of my physicians go over and beyond to make sure I have anything I need and understand all medical information. I am also prone to research things that I am unfamiliar with via the internet.

0.788900	I feel as though I have the capacity to obtain information, but the part where I may need help most is interpreting the information in a way that I understand it. A medical diagnosis is great, but unless my doctor can explain it to me in a way that I can understand, and also understand everything that accompanies it, then the diagnosis itself is useless to me. In my current health care system, if you speak to enough people, eventually you will be directed to the person who can help answer your question.

0.916667	Based on the previously asked questions I fully understand and I am fully capable of answering and filling out medical forms. 
0.605600	At the present time, when people need medical health they don't worry about understanding the information that is provided to them. They usually focus on getting healthier and resolving their matter.Each person should have a basic understanding of their health information and services that are provided to them in order to make their long term decision. 
0.683333	nothing really to say to that.i can understand basic health information.i don't really go to the doctor office that much for it to make a difference

0.666667	I make my decisions based on what seems common sense and what my body is trying to tell me butI can not always go by professional lingo .They use big words that are not intended for my understanding.Paper work is always hard for me due to poor sight and words that mean little to me in sone instances.
0.572200	I am somewhat in the middle. I think my problem is I don't know how to ask the right question and don't know how to process the information correctly. I think I should be more active in asking questions. Usually the visits are less than 10-20 minutes and I forget to ask every important question.
0.916700	I am of sound mind and well researched. I know how to read and write and I can understand information or find answers on my own. But I'm not afraid to ask for help if I need it because my health is important.

0.883333	I can fully read, understand and fill out most forms and reading material. The problem I have with my doctor is time. She doesn't respond to emails fast at all. Takes a day or 2. Sometimes the nurse calls. When I see her she rushes me out of her office because my insurance only pays so much which I think stinks, but i don't blame her. If I have a question I get a better response from the RN assistant. It takes forever to get a referral done. 
0.794444	I feel that I have a pretty decent capacity to evaluate basic health info and services in order to make overall sound decisions for my healthcare.
0.705600	I can understand basic health information if I have the time to research it, but I often feel that they're rushed and would rather not go into it so I don't ask them. Only in rare cases where it's very important do I ask for clarification then and there.

0.805556	I understand about 90% of the medical language used to describe my afflictions, blood tests results, meds, treatments etc. My girlfriend helps me with the rest.

0.616700	I've never really had any confidence in dealing with this kind of stuff on my own. I've always been a rather sheltered and dependent person, so depending on the importance, I'd prefer it if someone were to go over it with me or walk me through it to minimize errors. I don't do anything like this that often either, so I'm sure if I had more practice, I'd be all right on my own.
0.916667	I feel very capable of understanding basic health information to make appropriate decisions regarding my health.  
0.616700	If I am interested in a not very serious illness then I look for information in the internet, but I always seek advice from the doctor is the condition is somewhat more serious.

0.794444	It was a very good thing to do,I have fun do it.i do not have much to send. Well I have a good day and God bless you
0.761111	Considering the fact that I've had a lot of health issues growing up, I feel im more than capable. Whenever I have questions I'm more than willing to ask my health care provider. While I was in the military it was recommended that you asked questions due to the fact you weren't guaranteed to see the same doctor and a person should be informed of their ailments so they can explain it to another health care provider.

0.777800	I feel like I am very capable of understanding any health information that providers give to me. However, my recent experience has been that providers may give you conflicting information and may be highly unavailable to answer questions and communicate poorly in general. For example, my husband has high blood pressure and his old PCP said to try to reduce salt, while his neurologist said that salt intake doesn't matter. In our community, we have facilities run by Banner, and our experiences has been that these doctors have poor communication and don't feel bothered to answer questions or return phone calls. 
0.605600	I understand my health questions quite a bit if not I tend to ask the doctor or dentist office as they told me not to check on internet as they said that information is not correct and to come to them only.

0.883333	I have no problem asking my doctor questions about test results, telling him things I'm doing to improve my health, and getting him to explain results I may not be comfortable with.

I have no problem digesting even relatively complex information about health issues, symptoms, treatment. If I have any questions about information, I have no problem whatsoever communicating with the relevant health care provider in order to obtain any needed clarification. I am also rather vigilant about communicating any questions or concerns I may have when I don't understand information being relayed to me by a provider, as well as when informing them about my own issues or various respective symptoms.

0.761100	I think as long as someone is good at explaining it I can usually comprehend most of it. I guess I t would depend on what was being discussed
0.416700	Most of the time I feel out of place. The explanations the doctors give have such high medical vocabulary that it is difficult to understand what they are saying. I feel I get lost in the middle of their explanation. When something is hand written by a doctor for a prescription it is even worse since half of the time I cant understand what they are writing wether it is the name of a medicine or the instructions on how to take them. The procedures are also hard to understand. It all comes down to the amount of endless information I fell I am given by the doctors. Its too much to take at once, most of the time.

0.916700	My mother was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic colon cancer in November of 2015. At this point, I spend three days a week in some kind of hospital setting. I run a blog for OTHER people who have difficulties with the same kind of situations you mentioned. I have learned to advocate for my mother and myself within the medical community.

0.811100	I am as capable as anyone at understanding health information provided to me, but health is very specific and individual and I believe often that doctors speak in generalities because to do more would require more time than they have to offer or I want to pay for.  So some specifics, or details that would make my situation different from the norm, get lost unless I continue to have a problem that warrants further specific attention.
0.866667	i feel that my decisions, according to my health in general, could improve a bit more so that I could cooperate with my primary care physician or general practitioner overall, and fully feel better with life
0.850000	I recently had numbness in my right toe due to a pressure on my L5S2, occurring from when I had to lift a 300lb person after finding them intentionally overdosed. When I realized that the problem wasn't circulatory - neither bathing in warm water nor going for a walk helped - I hit up urgent care. When I arrived, I succinctly described my issues as above. They immediately send for a neurologist, because they could rule out other causes due to my ability to explain in sufficient terms. I also grew up with my grandparents due to a shit parent, so I had to help them understand pharmaceutical interactions.
0.855600	If I ever need help understanding anything at the pharmacy, they always are willing to take the time to explain any side effects or questions I have about specific medications.  When I see my doctor, it can sometimes be a little more rushed because he has so many patients during the day he has to see and he runs a very tight schedule.  However, I never felt like he answered any of my questions inadequately.  I usually do research on my own (online), before I go in for an appointment, so that I am better prepared to ask relevant questions regarding my potential diagnosis or ailments.  Therefore I know what to ask and usually have a good understanding of the health information presented to me.

I will not go back to a doctor who behaves that way, it just shows they don't care.

0.900000	The issues that I've had, most doctors diagnosed accurately. Now that we have internet, I can look up more details about what I have and what to expect. Some doctors explain what you have, they just don't go into detail or have too many patients and rush you out.

0.477800	Most of that stuff goes over my head. I don't even read it half the time. The United States health care system is designed to screw us over. Who cares if I miss the fine print? It's all the same to me. Nobody cares.

0.916700	As long as they don't use technobable only understandable by nurses and doctors I don't have problems understanding what is told to me (or read about it). The problem is (for me) to get them to give me the information (that seems to be something they don't want to give).

0.833300	I understand the majority of what doctors or nurses tell me. The only times I do not understand is when it is a subject that I know nothing about. I usually ask questions and when i do not fully understand I will try to learn about things from Google.
0.900000	Some information are difficult to fill. These questions can be like health insurances questions. n/a
0.722200	i like the doctors that i go do. if there is anything that is in writing and i am not understanding they are willing to sit down and explain things no matter how long it is going to take then to explain. If the doctor is there and the nurse needs further help he is going to do the same thing to assist. the hospital always wants to make sure the patient is well aware of their diagnosis the medicine was was given and the amout of what needs to be taken. 
0.794400	I feel pretty confident in my ability. However, sometimes when new information is given it's hard to process it on the spot and know which questions to ask. I often think of questions after I have left the doctor's office. 
0.638900	I think I have the capacity to understand basic health information but I do often check things out online and by doing so, it can often make me question things that the doctor or nurse have told me.

0.733300	I feel that many doctors and physicians use very technical terms, and do not want to spend the time to explain everything.  I trust a lot of what the doctor tells me with very little questions so that I do not waste their time.  I rely on using the internet to search out or answers any questions I may have
0.866667	I feel that I have the complete capacity to explain and understand basic health information.  I have complete capabilities to understand things. And I also have the capacity to explain anything that is a problem, or anything that needs explaining.

Sometimes if there are too many technical terms being used I might have to ask either my doctor or someone else (my sister is an RN so I can call her and ask for her help) to explain in more plain language. But most of the time I don't have a problem. As far as obtaining services and information, that's a little bit trickier. There's the issue of services being available or not available in my area, long waits to see a doctor, and the massive cost of seeing a doctor. And I've had a few issues where I've gone to the ER or the walk-in clinic in my town and ended up seeing a doctor who doesn't seem to care about explaining what's going on to me. But overall I feel like I can probably make appropriate health decisions. Not 100% confident, but at least 70-80%.

If something is unclear I can ask a nurse or doctor to explain it further. I also have a good relationship with my doctor so conversations come easy. 
0.855600	I can usually understand most information given me and I am determined enough to make sure that doctors listen to me and that they explain things I am uncertain about. My biggest concern is that I don't always know what questions to ask.

0.838900	For the most part, I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the given information and external resources; however, the glut of resources available (between internet resources, studies, constant barrage of news, etc.) can make decisions more difficult. I feel this is further compounded by the general distrust of healthcare providers as of late due to news coverage, dealing with cost of services and insurance coverage, and the volume of patients versus the number of healthcare professionals to allow adequate time to get the information that one needs. These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics.
0.855556	I feel like I have no issues understanding hospital and health  information because I can talk to the doctor and ask questions if I have any.

The internet is a great resource, and I'll usually do a lot of research there. I'll ask the doctor questions when needed as well, but I've learned that doctors are not as well-versed in all aspects of health as some people may assume, and I always look beyond the doctor's opinion into scientific research and other resources.

I do ask questions a lot which they probably don't like, and I try not to come off as a know it all because I definitely see them as the experts.  
0.811100	I feel like I have the capacity to understand the information.  I feel that it is extremely difficult to either ask the right questions or get the doctor to take time to explain things in-depth.  I usually leave frustrated that I don't have the information I need to make a good decision.

0.916700	Im typically a detail and fine print person so I always read information thoroughly and if I have a question I ask and build on it if it doesn't make sense to me. An example would be when I had 5 disk fusion surgery on my neck. The Surgeon had given me some pamplets to read that were essentially percentages of improvement. I may have a 20 percent full recovery or 12 percent full use of my right arm or 8 percent no change at all. The percentages made little sense since none left me with a 50 / 50 chance of improvement and I had to ask more questions as to whether this expensive surgery had any upside at all.

For example, I had to see a doctor a few years ago over my swimmers ear and I had to figure out how to stop the pain in my right ear. I asked my doctor every question pertaining to how fast I would be healed.
0.722200	Well, I did major in neuroscience in college so I do have somewhat of a scientific background.  And health knowledge as I was a premedical student.  Still, there are many terms and things that I am not aware of today and can always use the help/guidance of professiols in explaining some of these current health issues today.  It never hurts to get more information I feel.
0.655556	Why don't I get a chance to get health services. I'm single people say that you should be able to get health services I have tried to better myself but it is no good I have tried too do thing the right why but the lord doesn't want to bless me . I have to have a child to have in order to get health benefits I thought it was for anyone to get health services . So I have to have a child in order to be able to take care of myself that is more of a problem then not being able to have kids so that means that I will start having unprotected sex have a kid and not be able to take care of it because I don't have a job . That's mean more bills and someone else's responsibility . Not mine that is not how life works  . You lay down you get up and take care of Busness at the job place .
