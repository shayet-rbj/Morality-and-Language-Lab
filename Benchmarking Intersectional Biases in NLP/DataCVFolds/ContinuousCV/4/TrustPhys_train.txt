0.680000	With my PCP, there has been a long relationship, he know my needs/wants and is able to accommodate them in most instances. If I did not trust my PCP, I would get a different one. 
0.520000	I trust them that they think they are doing the right thing. What worries me is what they could be doing wrong.
1.000000	It's their job to be honest and to give me all of the information available
1.000000	I trust my doctor completely. He has never wronged me and he is always willing to listen to my most intimate problems and give objective advice on what to do to treat any ailments I have.
0.640000	Some doctors are in it for the money
0.720000	I'm still alive!  He must be doing something right.
0.760000	I primarily trust my doctor. She seems to be interested in what's best for me, not necessarily what's fastest or most convenient.
0.680000	I think my doctor is generally trustworthy.  I wonder sometimes with the things he says if he is pushing me to get on drugs because he wants to write RX for those types of drugs.
0.880000	They're busy and tired, but they have guidelines and responsibilities to give me the best care for me. They didn't waste all that time in school and during their career to give me poor treatment. I trust them.
0.600000	I don't really have an opinion of most doctors. Some are good and some are shitty.
0.720000	My doctor listens and allows me to complete my sentences (doesn't interrupt). My doctor asks me pertinent questions.
0.760000	Because I do feel that sometimes doctors pushes way to much medicines
0.800000	They have given me the proper care I have needed up until this point.
0.480000	I trust my family doctor greatly. I've been using him since I was a teenager. I never had a problem with him.
0.720000	I do trust Docs but they also are human and can be moody, high strung and sometimes jackasses
0.680000	I'm usually a pretty healthy individual, so I only ever go see him for my regular annual physicals. I really have no reason to doubt what he tells me, since I'm a very low-maintenance person health wise.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician.  I have been seeing her for 17 years so I completely trust her as a doctor. 
0.600000	I more or less trust my doctor. I think it has primarily due to how she treats me. She's very nice and that inspires trust.
0.240000	My dr. won't let me ask a lot of questions. Like my diabetes medicine. I tried asking about getting something else but he told me no. I wish there was a way that I could learn more
0.560000	I trust them to an extent. However, they are human, they make mistakes and they can't always devote full attention to every patient.
0.960000	I trust my Doctor because I have been with them for a long time. They have always gave me accurate information and diagnosed problems with relative ease. I have never had an issue that resulted from any decision they have made regarding my plan of care.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician when we talk about what could be wrong, and early treatments.  However I always go online and take a look about what I can find and see what other options are.  I know that the health system is not perfect, and I try to minimize doing anything unnecessary.
0.640000	I do not know my physician well enough because I do not visit him very frequently. I also do not trust people too much to begin with.
0.520000	I feel that they generally are trying to rush you out of the office and don't really care that much.
0.600000	I've only seen my doctor once for a physical and she seemed a little dismissive of my concerns. I was told by a different doctor I may have a condition that requires a simple blood test but she stated that it was unnecessary and ignored my symptoms. 
0.440000	It's not necessarily that I don't trust my doctor but  I think she's far too rushed for such a serious matter. She is very casual and nonchalant about things that are of great importance to my life. She brushes off side effects/symptoms as if they are normal every day things but then puts me on medication to alter them and brings up having to have heart surgery. I am getting mixed messages and it makes me unsure of the severity or what she is thinking about course of treatment.
0.720000	I trust my physician to a point. The only thing I don't like is getting my blood pressure taken, and then I don't get told immediately what it is. I need to have this information.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him
0.520000	I trust them because I have been with them since I was a kid. However, their practices seem a little bit outdated compared to others.
0.600000	Overall I have slight trust in the medical world. I think my doctor is persuaded by large pharma companies and I think a lot of the times they do things that are easier or make more money.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because it seems he always has my best interests in mind. He doesn't lie to me as far as I know. He also doesn't just push medication on me, he tries to understand what I actually need.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have a long relationship with her, she has shown me that she is capable. She has helped me many times.
0.400000	I haven't had a lot of experience with my new doctor that would allow me to build a proper relationship.
0.520000	I view them more of a guide than an expert on everything. For more common occurrences, I believe he has his way of doing things, which isn't necessarily the only way or even the best way. 
0.600000	it depends on the person. not all doctors are good
0.840000	In general, my primary care physician has been a very good fit for me.  He does work in a very busy practice, so I can imagine that he might overlook something in my care, but I have not seen him do so in my dealings with him.
0.400000	I don't really trust or distrust him, I am kind of ambivalent about him.  He seems perfectly nice but he's usually in quite a rush and makes me feel like I'm a hassle just for being there sometimes.  I don't like that he doesn't remember or check information in my chart, especially since it's a small practice and I've been there for years.  If I'm in for strep throat or something, he always tries to prescribe a medicine I'm allergic to and his nurse has to stop him.
0.760000	I have been to him for over a decade as has my spouse. He is a great doctor
0.720000	Not a special reason
0.640000	I trust my doctor's motives; I don't think his knowledge is always complete.  I live in a relatively small town and use a primary-care physician simply to order things like routine cholesterol screenings, and perhaps as a first source of information about things I can't figure out myself. If I had a significant medical problem, I would try to drive somewhere else and see a specialist.
0.400000	My primary care physician is not interested in my care.  He just wants me in and out so he can get to the next patient or have sometime off in between patients.  He only ever tells me one option even if I ask for another option he will just tell me the first option was better.
0.400000	They work for a business just like anyone else. You can't trust them more than you trust any salesman.
0.960000	I have seen my same doctor for a long time. He always has my best interest in mind. I have always been able to rely on his judgement. 
0.840000	I go to him because I do not understand enough about what is wrong to make a decision. If I didn't trust my doctor, I wouldn't have gone
0.440000	I don't trust doctors in general because most of them don't take their own advice on eating/exercise. Most of them also just flat out laugh in your face when you decide to take control over what happens to your body and just don't follow their instructions blindly. Doctors that I have been to in the past have been pushy for me to get certain shots or things that I have researched and decided I don't want. 
0.200000	"Doctors are only out to make as much money as possible. There should never be a time when you make an appointment at a doctors and have to wait a month to see them or be told to go to the ER ""if"" it's an emergency. Doctors should have patient CAPS and all doctors should be required to take all insurances. Also a doctor should never have so many appointments that you see their nurses aid instead of them."
0.400000	They tend to go for the easiest and quickest solution possible so they can see as many patients a day as possible. They are not after helping people, they are after making money.
0.960000	My doctor will always lay out several options if I have a problem and she will go over all of them with me and tell me the pluses and minuses to each one and then she will help me to make the best choice for what I need and if she disagrees with something I have chosen she will tell me why and then say what she thinks would be a better choice
0.600000	I don't distrust my physician. However, they are often rushed to get to the next patient so I don't always trust that they are being as thorough as possible.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest with me. If I had any problem in the past he always told me my options and explained the consequences. 
1.000000	I know him personally so I know he'd tell the truth
0.720000	I think for the most part my doctors are honest. However, I still factor in my own opinions. 
0.400000	I don't trust them anymore. I will go to the Emergency room if I have to but the doctors where I live are all foreign. The nurses in the hospital are all from Haiti. I live near 33460 and we have tons of illegals and foreign people here. They don't seem to care as much about quality of care, like I had growing up in Alabama.
0.800000	My PCP is very thorough in every appointment and takes the time to not only discuss options, but also make sure that there is no pressure to pick a particular option since it is my treatment. 
1.000000	She has never lied or led me in the wrong direction.
0.800000	Because they take a medical oath and have ethics that they have to follow. It's not about what they want to do, its about what's right and what's wrong. They have always looked out for my interest in health care and are not subjective or bias.
0.840000	I feel my doctor explains his decisions fully and gives me the opportunity to take part in the process. I feel he is intelligent and I have no reason not to trust him.
0.680000	I believe he's a good guy I generally trust him. Gut reaction
0.800000	I trust my doctor because the information he has provided has been accurate and in line with any additional testing I have had done. 
0.240000	I don't trust them. They've screwed up before.
0.720000	I trust him as a person but I'm not sure if I can fully trust any doctor. I've seen a lot of documentaries and read a lot about the health care system in regards to Black people. I don't believe they always have my well being in mind. 
0.760000	Trust by verify. I am smart enough to know not to trust my internet/google searches when it comes to my health, but I'm also smart enough to know that 99 times out of 100 my minor ailments and annual checkups are best handled by my PCP and I can rely on his expertise
0.720000	They have always been open and honest and answer all my questions throuhgly
0.640000	He is very young but seems to be engaged with his patients 
0.560000	I don't know if I trust doctor's in general, I feel that they may be only looking out for themselves, but I can't pinpoint why. It's probably just distrust for that type in general.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He has never led me wrong so far.
0.440000	I distrust because Dr's are human too.
0.720000	My doctor takes time to listen and try to explain things to me.  She seems very thorough in here assessment of my situations and has not steered me wrong yet in health decisions.
0.480000	I have a tumor in my jaw and there are treatments out there for it, but it seems like the surgeons try to persuade me to have surgery without being open to other options. Only one has told me about other options.
0.280000	i DONT THINK SHE HAS TIME TO LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS. SHE ONLY WANTS TO TREAT ONE LITTLE THING WHEN i THINK THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. SHE GIVES MEDS TO QUICKLY
0.760000	I think alot of the time they make alot of money off people having disease that they over diagnose and over medicate
0.760000	I trust them to do their job. They have the knowledge and hopefully the honesty to do it correctly
0.960000	My doctor takes the time to sit with me and make sure I understand what he is saying.  He has day with me doing research on medication and takes my opinion seriously. 
0.600000	I think they are very busy and default to common diagnosis.  Seems like it takes a few follow ups before they go into any depth.
0.640000	At times, non-traditiol treatment options may be overlooked or undervalued depending on a doctor's experience and history, when altertive options paired with modern medicine can find a useful balance.
0.720000	I have not had any problems with my doctor. The only thing i don't trust or have a problem with is when i think something needs to be checked or im worried about someone it is brushed off and not taken seriously.
0.760000	I trust her because I have know her for years and she is very approachable and friendly. She is willing to be honest and frank with me, even if the truth hurts.
0.720000	I have been seeing the same primary for years, since I was a teeger. He delivered my oldest daughter and he has always been forthcoming.  He is also the primary for most of the women in my family and has always been wonderful to all of us.
1.000000	I really trust her because she listens to me and takes my views and opinions into account. She also is very smart and thinks out loud with me about options to address my concerns rather than just deciding on an option for me.
0.800000	My physician seems concerned about my health. She is willing to talk to me and takes my concerns into consideration.
0.520000	"I just sometimes feel that my doctor and doctors in general are in a rush. They do what they always do to treat certain problems. If their treatment doesn't work, then ""oh well."" I've had several medical issues that I've gone to doctors for over and over and I just don't get any real concern or any improvement. No persol care, so I just don't have a high level of trust."
0.280000	I grew up around a lot of christain science folks and saw how healthy they are. most long term medication has consequence and I avoid it. Doctors are trained to treat symptoms, not the problems cause
0.840000	I have been seeing the same primary care doctor since I was a child. I have complete faith in my doctor and will always take his suggestions and recommendations to heart.
0.600000	I THINK HE IS A GOOD DR. HE TRIES VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO ME AND HELP ME OUT. WE ALSO TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO HIM. HE IS VERY THOUROGH
0.760000	she's been the only doctor that has found an antidepressant that didn't give me side effects
0.720000	I trust them because of their experiences and knowledge 
0.840000	Basically if I or my family have complaint about our health we will go to our family doctor. We trust our family doctor, if he ask us to see specialist we will do.
0.960000	I have had a long-term relationship and we communicate well. I have never had any issues with this doctor.
0.640000	I trust them for the most part but they do seem to make sp judgements and not to go in depth as i would like
0.880000	I feel that my doctor and I have a good relationship and that we can trust each other to work through any problems that might arise. I feel that my doctor knows that I want to know how my health is going and what I need to change in my life.
0.920000	I trust them with my care. They know more medical stuff than I do. It would be crazy not to trust them.
0.840000	I have been given no reason not to trust her. She always has good advice and doesn't push pills as the fix for something.
0.400000	Recently I was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. I've been telling my Dr. I had problems but he kept saying it was bronchitis. He got it wrong.
1.000000	They've never given me a reason to not trust them.
0.760000	I have been seeing them for many years.
0.200000	They are in it for the money. They do not actually care.
0.960000	I have been with my doctor long enough for him to know my history. I think he always chooses the best path for me and we work together on long term plans for health. 
0.480000	Doctors are human, Some are qualified/competent, some are incompetent. Some put patient care over money, some put money over care, etc. I wouldn't blindly trust anyone for anything without doing some reasearch on my own, getting a second opinion if necessary, and considering the facts myself. 
0.760000	My physician has helped me in positive ways thus far, but I never like to put my complete trust in anyone because you just never know. 
0.760000	i trust them because i have used them for years and they have no reason to be dishonest to me
0.360000	I don't really trust doctors because in the United States, where I live, healthcare is a for-profit industry. Doctors are basically no different than salesman, and, selling products myself, I know what goes into trying to get people to buy a product. It's not honest; it's not about care; it's about money. I also think many doctors are not realistic about the way people live their lives.
0.920000	My doctor has always been very honest about everything...even if I might not want to hear it.  I feel like we have good, honest conversation and I feel comfortable discussing anything with him.
0.800000	my doctor have decades of experience and it great at treating me correctly and with the right medication
0.840000	I think they have the knowledge to know what is wrong and it seems reasoble about what they are telling me. I see no reason to distrust them until they prove me wrong.
0.920000	He took an oath to make sure his patients are cared for to the best of his ability. He went to school for years to get to where he is, and that means it's persol for him.
0.760000	i do trust him for the most part. in the past there were instances where me and some others have doubted him but as he grows older he seems to have more of a better understanding of things now.
0.440000	I distrust my primary care physician because she is always in a rush and in a hurry and basically often ignores what I am concerned about by brushing it off as no big deal. She often pushes medications as well when I make it clear that I do not want to use medicine as a first resort.
0.840000	I believe that doctors enter the profession because they want to help people. It would be unethical for them to mislead their patients. 
0.680000	I've had the same primary care doctor my whole life, he's never done anything to make me feel like he isn't trustworthy or qualified.  He knows me very well (and my family) and I feel like I can trust him to do what's best for me.
0.640000	While I do think that they can sometimes be thorough and careful, I do believe that sometimes it's only to fit their hypotheses. I don't firmly stand by that, but I do believe some just want to get patients in and out without so much as a second appointment or a scheduling more exams. 
0.680000	My doctor wants to give his all, but the time crunch between patients can make it difficult for him.  
0.880000	We have a great relationship where he fields my questions appropriately. He also understands my background when giving explations.
0.600000	I trust my doctor for the most part. There are a few occasions when I do more research because I feel like the doctor is not telling me everything or that he doesn't have my best interest. When it comes down to it, I trust him more than often.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because they always walk me through all of my options with any issue I may be having. I never feel pushed into taking medicine or doing something I am not comfortable with. They answer all my questions and make me feel secure and knowledgeable in my health choices.
0.920000	Always honest with me, asks me questions to really know what's going on and to also ensure I understand
0.320000	I HAVE NO REASON TO TRUST MY DOCTOR. HE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN HIS BOTTOM LINE. I NEED TO CHANGE DOCTORS
0.920000	My doctor has always given me a real prognosis and I appreciate that. My clinical doctor has always checked my neck and given me through physicals to make me feel at ease. Any bumps or pains are always checked, and he makes me feel comfortable. 
1.000000	Doctors care about people, thats why they do what they do. They are properly trained and can generally be trusted.
0.280000	Primary care physicians literally couldn't care less about what you have to say or the symptoms you have. They only care about the blood work. They want you in and out as fast as possible. Primary care physicians live to get off at 5. 
0.760000	I have been seeing my primary doctor for several years, and she is well known and thought of in our small community. I know her outside of the office as well. I fully trust her to help me solve any medical issues, or to at least help direct to any specialist I may need.
0.720000	My doctor is relatively new, and I had not been in a few years. I was very nervous, because I have never liked going to the doctor, hospital, etc. She was so easy mannered, understanding and really listened to my concerns. I liked that, and have been going back ever since for regular check-ups/ins.
0.720000	I trust my current PCP very much! I had very negative experience with a previous PCP who didn't want to take on my complicated medical history, but I am currently very lucky.
0.440000	Because medical knowledge is still limited but doctors seem to think they have fil solutions, when in fact a lot of medicine is still trial and error. 
0.640000	If I didn't trust them I would stay home. Ginger!
0.680000	Sometimes I fear that the pharmaceutical industry makes the decision what pills I get, rather than my persol doctor. I trust my doctor in terms of surgeries and maybe pain magement but outside of that, I wouldn't take any pills they recommend. 
0.680000	I trust my primary physician because he has always given me good advice and never steered me wrong 
0.680000	Ultimately, I trust my primary care physician. He has more knowledge than I do and a medical degree, so I will trust him or get a second opinion if it were a really big deal.
0.600000	He seems capable, but not particularly out of the box or persol.  He seems a little confused and passive when I talk to him, but mostly that's because he's giving me basic info and agreeing with me.  There's also nothing particularly wrong with me, I just go for checkups, so it's not like I've really strained his abilities.
1.000000	I just do? He gives me good vibes, he knows what he's talking about. I feel at ease and comfortable with the care that I get.
0.480000	I feel that most doctors are there to meet their bottom line.  They care more about the money they can make than the people that they see.  
0.760000	I trust her because she never seems in a rush and always has time for my questions or concerns.  She does not just shove a drug at me and send me on my way.
0.560000	I trust them because I have to and I can read and do my own research when it's necessary to question them. But they work for large companies and i'm not always convinced they have MY best interest rather than the company or even their own intentions for a specific outcome.
0.560000	I don't really have a primary at the moment. For doctors in general, I feel as if some of them are good and some of them are bad. Some are only interested in themselves and making money and other actually care. Its a toss up. 
0.480000	I don't completely trust my doctor because I know that insurance plays into this. Some things just don't get approved so they have to tell me different stuff. Also their persol beliefs play in so I know they  may not be honest with me at times.
1.000000	He's always taken the time to explain things about my care thoroughly to me and without complaining. He seems to genuinely care about my health.
0.760000	They know a lot more about the medical field than me. They wen to medical school, studied and learned more things than I know. Its usually better to trust an experts opinion on things like this. 
0.640000	I trust the doctors because they have been in the field and schooling for a long period of time.  I do struggle with them telling me what is convenient for them and what is best for me. 
0.400000	My primary care doctor usually seems rushed and annoyed. I can tell she wants to do her job but perhaps doesn't like the scheduling or the company that mages her. Overall I don't really trust her to make educated decisions for me, and had to beg for a cholesterol test. It had been six years, at least, since my prior one. 
0.920000	I have been going to him for a while and he is great.  He actually listens to you and you can tell he really cares
0.440000	"I think he is too focused on certain health issues (my weight) and not focused enough on the things that are causing me to have poor quality of life (chronic migraine, chronic pain from arthritis) even though my poor quality of life is a major factor in why I am overweight - because I'm uble to exercise without pain, I have no energy to cook healthy food, etc. etc. But people don't like ""fat chicks"" and doctors always seem to focus on that as a #1 problem no matter what. "
0.760000	I just started with a new doctor, and she is young and persoble. She listens intently, asks me about my choices, and offers a variety of possible treatment plans. I greatly appreciate that after my previous doctor, who was nice but more interested in pushing supplements she had a fincial interest in.
0.760000	Its not that I don't trust in what they're saying to me, I just have to realize that they may not always be right, and with a serious diagnosis I would definitly seek a second opinion and move from there
0.520000	My primary care physician waves off my chronic health concerns and pretending my chronic stomach issues are normal or not a cause for concern even though I see them as very serious and suffer because of them.
0.800000	She listens to me
0.480000	I am forced to go to a clinic by my house that rarely lets me see an actual doctor. Many times when I go for specific reasons or health issues they ignore those and don't do anything for it. I am always forced to see a nurse practitioner who always has to look up stuff in books to treat me.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she took the time to get to know me and listen to my concerns. She regularly asks questions about things we've discussed previously.
0.840000	My GP knows more about medicine than I do and the only way diagnosis and treatment will work is if I participate and do my best as a patient.
0.600000	I don't completely trust Western medicine and only seek it out when it is absolutely necessary.  I don't always trust the doctor's information especially when they just want to prescribe a pill to mask symptoms and not really deal with the core of the problem.  I take everything my doctors say with a grain of salt.
0.520000	I trust my doctor because despite his hurried overall attitude he has done nothing but provide me with proper medical care and make the best choices for my health.
0.800000	I trust them for the most part. I feel that he doesn't have all the expertise I need for my different conditions though.
0.840000	I have a very good Doctor. I have no reason not to trust him. 
0.600000	I think that sometimes the doctor is not listening to my concerns and is just giving me text book or generic answers.
0.720000	My doctor has always been honest with me, even if it means telling me something I don't want to hear. She gives me a variety of treatment options when they are available, and that helps build trust. 
0.640000	I am very new to my provider. She came highly recommended and I felt comfortable the few times I have seen her. But I have not had to use her for anything more than basic check ups.
1.000000	My doctor is one of the first who has taken the time to really get to know me and has been the best doctor I've ever had.
0.840000	I have been going to my primary care physician for a long time now, so I understand his methods and we have a relationship. He knows my habits and health concerns, and he never hesitates to tell me the good and the bad. He let me see the reports and exam results so I can see for myself what is happening, and he'll answer any questions I have. 
0.400000	my doctor sees so many patients they usually diagnos you with what everyone else has. they only spend like 5 minutes with you.
0.800000	I have been going to this Doctor since I was a young boy and he has taken amazingly good care of me and my family.  He is also a member of my church and we know his family.  He has fully earned my trust and respect.
0.680000	
0.480000	Doctors seem to often be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. I feel like they don't ask me enough questions. I feel like they don't take the time to fully and accurately diagnose me.
0.440000	Doctors these days are money motivated and are paid by the system. It's rigged to get people on prescriptions that kill you!
0.520000	i distruct my primary care physcian because i see a different person each time. I never have someone who knows me. I'm always explaining things. It's like im a car and the mechanic is different each time.
0.600000	Everyone is different. Some are better than others.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because they went to school for years to study medicine. They have a wealth of knowledge behind them I could never grasp
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician as I have been going to him for a few years now.
0.800000	I think they want to help people .That's what they went to school and training for. So, I trust that they know what they're doing and can make the best decisions.
0.800000	I have been going to my PCP for over 10 years.  She is always happy to see me, and takes all the time that I need.  Every decision she makes has been the right one.  She has so much experience and makes me feel well cared for. 
0.760000	My primary is very knowledgeable and listens to what my concerns are, I feel very comfortable trusting him.
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor quite a bit.  She is upfront with me about things, and straightforward on her opinion of what I need to do. She also has been right so far about everything.
0.800000	My doctor seems straightforward and trustworthy. I feel no reason to doubt him.
0.600000	I trust her because she is the one who is looking over my health. I myself have to as well, but she knows the ins and outs of hte human body and what is good and not good.
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor because she has also been my parents' doctor for a long time, so I can trust her. 
0.800000	I trust doctors in general because of my experiences in the past. There are good and bad doctors, but I believe that overall they are trustworthy. 
0.800000	I've had the same physician for years now. So,  he has gained my trust.
1.000000	My doctor takes my concerns seriously. In fact, I had a problem with itching during my pregncy. The nurse line told me that it was in my head and to just deal with it. When I mentioned it to my doctor, she immediately ran tests and diagnosed me with a condition that required me to be induced right away, as it could have resulted in my baby being stillborn. The fact that she took my concerns seriously over something as small as itchy hands and feet shows she cares.
0.640000	I know they have the knowledge, but they also deal with so many patients on a daily basis, that I feel like they can get careless and annoyed easier because of that. I worry they don't care as much as they should.
0.760000	I trust my PC because she listens to me and what I am trying to accomplish. She hears me and allows me to have a say in if I want to take medicine, approach things a certain way. She cares. 
0.800000	My doctor is a straight-forward guy.  I believe that he tells me like it is.  I know that he's very good at his job.  I have confidence in him.
0.600000	The last time I visited my primary care physician, I felt they were a bit distant and basically told me to put ice on a foot injury, then walked away. Was kinda weird. Seemed like they wanted to leave.
0.800000	I trust my primary care provider because they take the time to talk things over with me. They also listen to me and any problems that I bring up. I can also rely on them to treat me and talk about treatments with me whenever I have a problem that needs to be taken care of. 
0.760000	I trust my physician. He knows me well enough and has always acted in my best interest. He is always willing to listen to my concerns.
0.600000	i trust that he has the experience and knowledge to handle basic issues but is always in a hurry which makes me think he doesn't want me to ask too many questions
0.760000	 I have wonderful doctors at always put my needs first if I have a question or problem they're happy to answer it or get me information to make a better choice 
0.760000	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind. At the end of the day he will do whats best for me even if it causes him an inconvenience 
0.880000	It features an open communication system. He listens. I listen. Discussions are thought-provoking. He is a valuable resource to not just myself, but my family.
0.840000	I've never had her judge me and she's very thorough in explaining why she things this medicine or htis procedure should be done and won't do anything unless I absolutely understand what is going on.
0.400000	My most recent primary care physician was very dismissive of my needs, did not inform me of the seriousness of my condition, and overall did not spend the requisite time with me to inform me of my condition. I am still living with the relevant condition as a result. 
0.600000	I trust them because obviously they must be doing something right to be in business
0.760000	My primary care physician has known me for majority of my life and is very thorough about what needs to be done about my medical needs.
0.720000	DOCTORS ARE LIKE GOD
0.800000	He is good and addresses any issue or concern that I have. 
0.920000	I've never had a reason to doubt a doctor when I've seen one. Every meeting I've had with a doctor has always gone well. The doctor has always given me a sense of confidence in their decisions.
0.440000	My doctor just seems to be in a rush to get from one patient to the next and doesn't spend much time with any one patient.
0.760000	"In general, I trust doctors. In the area where I live we have a good selection of doctors and health professiols to choose from so it is in their best interest to provide quality health care.  With the abundance of information available on the internet, people often use that information to get a ""second opinion"" of what doctors tell them as well."
0.640000	I think my doctors take the time to answer questions but also try to make sure I have the most options covered.
1.000000	We have an understanding and friendship and know that we can trust each other.
0.640000	I believe that they generally have the best interest of other people in mind, and do not want people to suffer. 
0.720000	She is easily distracted by other things it seems.
0.720000	I mostly trust my current health care provider, a nurse practitioner. She listens and took some of my recent experiences and behavior seriously. For example, I recently took someone else's pain pills because I was in serious pain. She saw that as a need for my pain to be addressed, not me overreacting.
0.440000	I normally distrust them. They love to hurry my along and don't seem like they're really listening to me. They just rather get me in-and-out quick to make fast money. I always leave there disappointed in them.
0.600000	I trust my doctor will listen and provide adequate care. However sometimes i feel like they need pushing in the right direction or motivation to provide the care. Sometimes I think it's easier for them to avoid a situation so they don't have to deal with it.
0.600000	I trust them to an extent but I don't have a very strong relationship with them and in general I'm a little suspicious of medical professiols.  I think they withhold some information from patients.  Plus I've had them tell me the wrong things before, things I knew were not true because I had found research conflicting it, so I sometimes just don't trust them.
0.880000	My PCP has been very open and honest about changes I've needed to make in my life to get and stay healthy. I never felt as though they were doing anything to persolly convenience herself, and I've trusted the advice given to me. 
0.400000	I dont disturst him, but I also dont completely trust him..  Dovtors do not know you from one visit to the next.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a persol friend and he was y friend before he became my doctor. He knows me very well.
0.800000	I have been with the same primary care physician for 15 years now. We have an excellent relationship where she is honest with me about what changes I need to make for better health, and I am honest with her about what my health goals are and the treatment I am or am not willing to undergo. She never tries to pressure me into making a healthcare choice that goes against what I want to do.
0.960000	Three generations of my family use my doctor as their primary care physician, and we all feel very comfortable with her. She has, on multiple occasions, found something of concern to her and sent us for testing which resulted in medical procedures needing to be performed. She prescribes medicine when we're sick, takes the time to fully explain what's going on, and responds quickly to emails/voicemails that we leave her.
0.760000	I have been with my family doctor for many years. She takes the time to explain things to me that I don't understand and doesn't ever do any unnecessary testing on me. She and I have a good doctor/patient relationship. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because when I come in asking about a condition or medication, she provides comprehensive guidance about why that might not be the best for me, as well as altertives. I feel that she's not just trying to placate me to get me out of the office or quickly move to her next patient. 
0.640000	I think that these days that doctors are trying to push more and more drugs that half the time you dont need. That is pretty scary to think about. Also treatment varies greatly from doc to doc even on simple things like a infection. So there are times i cant trust the doc 100%
0.600000	You choose to trust them based on if they deserve it.
0.600000	I have not found a regular doctor that I feel comfortable with.
0.720000	I trust my primary care, however sometimes I feel like she doesn't have all the information and that she's just trying her best. Sometimes I leave feeling confused. I feel like she is honest about all the different treatment options available, I just feel like she doesn't give the correct info because she doesn't know. 
0.760000	"I don't ask a whole lot of good questions, so I'm just like ""I guess you have the degree and experience, so whatever you say."" Maybe this is trusting enough but maybe this doesn't allow me the best control of my health."
0.520000	I do not like authority
0.720000	My doctors give me the facts. He or she does not sugarcoat my diagnosis. That makes me trust them.
0.800000	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a couple of years now. She takes the time to listen to my questions and makes sure I understand the answers. 
0.560000	My PCP seems rushed when I see her. She also seems tired and overworked. She seems like she cares a little, but she explains things to me but doesn't try to be super thorough. I probably wouldn't keep seeing her if I had actual health problems.
0.560000	i think they only want to prescribe you medications and other things that make you feel better and come back for more
0.760000	He's always been a straight shooter. He gives me the information that I need and tells me what I need to do going forward.
0.600000	I'm pretty neutral on this one. I feel that most doctors DO want to help you, but they also want to drag it out as long as possible for profit reasons. The end goal is a cure/help, but it's going to be VERY expensive.
0.600000	I would trust him. Unless your instincts say otherwise
0.440000	i don't usually trust doctors because they just make me feel uncomfortable. sometimes i feel like they don't listen to me at all. i also oftentimes feel like i am being judged by them. 
0.320000	Every single PCP I have had the displeasure of dealing with has been arrogant and rude to me. They don't seem to take anything I say seriously, and seem to just want to get the visitation over with. It's a one-size-fits-all approach for these guys.
0.600000	PCPs can be shadowed by other influences such as medical companies to push their products for kickbacks.  This is not true for every PCP but it is known.
0.760000	I do not have a primary care physician but I on the few occasions that I go to the dr, I trust what they tell me.
0.560000	I've had persistent neck pain for the last decade and was prescribed all sorts of treatment ranging from medication to injections. After basically giving up I found a simple over-the-counter medication that worked and had never been recommended.
0.680000	I think in general most Doctors, the ones I've seen have your best interest at heart, I don't always agree with everything they say, I believe most doctors are paid to prescribe medications. This makes it hard to completely trust at times.
0.840000	He listenes and talks with you about things, always explains well.
0.800000	I generally trust physicians. They have a lot of education and training by ture of the profession. Also, a doctor isn't likely to give poor care for too long, because it would likely be noticed. Doctors have a responsibility to be trustworthy, and I think that's the general cultural expectation.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because of the wonderful service that she provides me with. She always answers my questions and provides feedback for me regarding my questions.
0.440000	I do not think I do not trust my doctor, I just think she is rushed. She always has a ton of patients and book them so close together to make money that the care suffers. She rarely has time to talk about any concerns she is more in and out of the room. 
0.600000	In regards to doctors I feel like they can be trusted for the most part. They have a lot riding on being perfect in their profession. They can lose their jobs and whole practices if they don't perform. I think they can mainly be trusted because of this.
0.640000	I generally trust my primary care physician due to the relationship that we have developed. Over the several years that I have visited their office I have come to know and trust the opinion of my doctor and feel that he is looking out for what is the best for me. 
0.800000	She always gives it to me straight and never tells me any bull. She tells me what she thinks is wrong and tries to help me understand what is going on with my body. 
0.760000	My doctor is a professiol and uses their best judgement in dealings with my health. They also explain things to me and answer questions I have. This is why I trust my doctor. 
0.800000	MY primary care physician is always thorough with me and gives me good advice in regards to my treatment. I have always gotten better by doing what he says so I have a lot of faith in his judgements
0.760000	I believe he is looking out on my behalf.  He is very down to earth and honest.  He gives me the facts and I do my best to understand anything he tells me.  I do believe him, I do not think he tries to give me any false information.
0.520000	I think that it would depend on what they need in their life. That will affect what they tell me.
0.720000	I think that the doctor is good at her job, but she is young and seems a little inexperienced. I am not sure if that's a good or bad thing though, as generatiol differences can cloud judgement and can cause physicians to not keep up with the times or to not realize the correct standards of care.
0.800000	I've been going to the same primary care physician for about 20 years. He knows my medical history and has given me sound advice during that time. It is a relationship built on trust.
0.800000	They have not let me down. They have a lot of experience and they know what is best.
0.800000	I feel that doctors are for the most part trustworthy. But in general some are in a big hurry to get to the next patient. They sometimes make it seem like  are putting them out to ask many questions. Like you are wasting their time.
0.400000	My primary care physician has dismissed my worries and problems before. She misdiagnosed one of my family members and that family member ended up in the hospital because of it.
0.560000	I feel that doctors now a days are under so much pressure to see so many patients that things are rushed and missed.  
0.800000	I trust that my doctor gives me the best options for my care, and that he considers what I might need or already be taking before prescribing anything.  I do realize that sometimes mistakes can be made, but I feel that he will try and minimize these mistakes.
0.960000	I believe that doctors have my best interest in mind when treating me.
0.600000	I honestly don't trust anyone. I believe what they say is helpful but holistic approaches are good too. 
1.000000	If I have an issue my physician doesn't perform one test and then stop, like other physicians have. She's also very friendly and makes sure I understand everything she says. 
0.720000	It really depends on the situation, some doctors I feel like they don't have enough time to talk about a medical condition or they seem like they're too busy to really go into any type of detail. But I do have a doctor I normally see that does take the time out to explain what he thinks the root of a problem may be.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to ask my opinion on which way I would prefer to go for certain treatments of issues I've had. She will give me information and her opinion and statistics but she ultimately will let me decide which route I would prefer to take.
0.480000	"I really hate how ""trust"" is even a factor. It bothers me that when I'm given information, it sounds a lot like a factual answer when in fact it is an opinion. I've met young doctors who are bright, older doctors who are dim, and vice versa, so it's difficult to gauge the competency of who I'm speaking to. And really, the only way to tell if someone is right or wrong is if I know the answer already, which I almost never do. "
0.680000	I don't trust many doctors because alot prove to be more after money than helping the patients
0.800000	I have a relatively good experience with the doctors I've visited. I made sure to ask close family and friends about certain doctors they visited and which ones to avoid. I was able to draw conclusions from there.
0.680000	I trust my physician because I believe he is very knowledgeable and he considers different possibilities- he doesn't jump to conclusions. 
0.680000	Regarding doctors in general, I have trust in them because I have no other choice. I have to trust that my doctor has my interest in mind. However, I am also aware that many doctors are often sponsored my drug companies, or they could just be wrong about certain medical opinions. Therefore, it is necessary to get a second opinion. 
0.760000	I trust him because he is just doing his job. He has no reason to hide treatment options unless he honestly doesn't think they are worth mentioning.
0.720000	I've had the same primary for nearly my whole adult life. He also has had my parents as patients for many years. 
0.440000	"I distrust any doctor because I have had bad experiences with them in the past.  Ultimately I believe they are interesting in making money and nothing else.  Most of the time they seem bothered by your problems and do not listen to what I have to say.  I've been told before to take antidepressants for a pain in my stomach, which turned out to be a cyst on my ovary.  It took FIVE doctors to get a diagnosis that wasn't ""you're crazy."""
0.680000	I will trust my doctor because he can find the minor issue that other doctor may not be found.
0.800000	They seem trustworthy.  It is the insurance company I do not trust.
0.680000	I don't really have a primary care physician, I have been uninsured for many years. I try to put my trust in any doctor that is willing to see me on a self-pay, emergency basis. That is reality, and those are my choices in that reality.
0.640000	I like my doctor and he has always been conservative in his treatments.  He lets me know when something will have a side affect and also lets me know when he is doubtful that something will work but is willing to try.  I feel that he is in general very honest with me.
0.800000	I actually just met my PCP, but she came in having clearly read my file. She took a lot of time with me, didn't appear rushed at all. She had a good bed side manner. She gave appropriate recommendations and explained things well.
0.440000	It depends on the situation.  If the doctor is trying to push a new drug that is quite expensive then I would wonder if he is getting something out of the deal.  If I were to think that he may be wrong on a diagnosis then I would likely look for another opinion.  At the end of the day the doctor is a human and no human is perfect, so unless they give a reason to not believe them then I probably would lean towards trusting them unless I felt they were wrong in some way.  
0.760000	I assume they have the relevant information, training, and experience to make the recommendations they do, and follow from there.
0.240000	I barely trust mainstream doctors at all. A lot of their diagnoses are just guesses, but they act as if they KNOW what they're talking about and the patient doesn't. I use doctors mainly when I want a particular test done or think I need a prescription.
0.760000	I trust most doctors in general. I feel they provide adequate enough healthcare services. I don't really have a reason to not trust them because I feel like they know enough about whatever health-related things to made accurate assessments of my health. 
0.800000	Dr. Dixon is comforting for the most part and I have been a patient of hers for a long time so that helps me trust her. But sometimes I get confused.
1.000000	I have been going to my primary physician for almost 4 years now and never once have I felt that I was not important to her. She has been supportive and attentive always.
0.600000	He's been honest but one doctor is not an end-all game when it comes to my health, I should consult multiple doctors if a problem arises. Therefore, I don't have full unwavering trust in one doctor.
0.800000	My doctor has given me no reason not to trust them. They have provided me with the means to help whatever medical issues I have and have even gave me their contact info if it is after hours and I have an immediate need.
0.800000	He's always been there for us and has had good results in treatment. He hears me and has addressed my needs. So far he has been good at curing us.
1.000000	I've had the same doctor since I was a kid and in fact, he is my family's doctor. So my mother and even grandmother have a great deal of experience with him. He's willing to talk, answer questions and usually does well. Plus he hasn't killed any of us yet, so that's a great bonus.
0.320000	I feel as if there is too much for a physician to gain by their own self interests, they have medications that they feel are important to push on people with the side effects and all that considered they often over look the most simplistic things like change of nutrition, or even considering the factors of the patients life.
0.840000	She is always patient with me and takes as long as I need.  She never seems bothered when I ask her questions, and if I call with a problem, she usually can see me that day. 
0.680000	i really have no choice but to put my trust into my doctor sometimes, because health is theyre field. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I think he has my best interest at stake. He takes time to listen to my concerns and actually tries to help me. 
0.720000	I have great trust in my current position because I have seen my physician long enough that I trust what she will say and I trust that she understands what treatment is necessary. At this point I have established A rapport to give her complete trust. 
0.800000	He seems to have a good understanding of what goes on. He lets me know whatis likely and will order a test if I'm worried even if it's unlikely. Seems nice and caring
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has been in practice for a long time.  He is extremely experienced.
0.840000	I trust my doctor but have also disagreed with them over things that I knew were the current recommendations. So we had a discussion and he looked up the new information I gave him and thanked me for making him aware of it. Doctors are incredibly smart but things are constantly changing so I feel it is important to listen to them but, also advocate for yourself.
0.600000	Although I don't doubt that my primary care physician cares about me, I also believe that they are not my best friend. I try my best to listen to what they tell me but I also research the information I'm given on my own and find out what the best course of action is.
0.560000	Well, on the one hand, I trust my doctor because he is a trained professiol and I assume is there because he wants to help people as most doctors probably do.  On the other hand, medicine today is still very much a business.  Money.  And as we all know, when money is involved, there is an inherent conflict of interest at times and we must find very moral doctors who will rise above this conflict and do what is right.  Not all do.
0.760000	Most doctors choose to do what's right because if they get caught doing otherwise, they could lose their license. That is why I trust them in general.
0.400000	I haven't had a major sickness that would require me to seek out a new PCP so I've stayed with the one I've had since I was a teeger.  
0.560000	My doctor is pretty conventiol and doesn't explore any new avenues of thinking. Sometimes I have to offer him ideas on what might help me.
0.760000	I have had my primary care doctor for quite a few years now. She knows me well, and I trust that she will do what is best for my health. She is also available to talk to outside of office hours which is really great.
0.800000	I have had the same primary care physician for over twenty years. He has shown that he intends nothing but the best over the years. I've been able to see his professiolism and he even keeps extra tabs on me to see if I am doing well.
0.720000	I feel they have a lot of knowledge and this is their expertise.  I also feel like my doctor tries to get to know me. 
0.800000	My physician is highly regarded and always takes the appropriate amount of time to see me. He doesn't rush me out of his office for other patients, and I feel that he gives me his full attention.
0.800000	For the most part I trust my doctor (who is actually a PA).  I can see in his eyes and actions that he really is reading my material and really does want to help.  It is my responsibility to make sure anything he says applies to me but for the most part I go along with what he says because of the time and care he puts into his words.
0.480000	This is more about the doctor I see most often which is my gastroenterologist, he always seems to be pushing me to non-generic drugs even though I like the way my body reacts to what I am currently taking.  I also feel he pushed me into an endoscopy I did not at all need, just to get another year supply of a drug I depend on.  All in all that cost me $2500 out of pocket that I couldn't afford at the time. 
0.360000	I do not trust completely in my doctor or any doctor for that matter. In 2010, I kept having chest pains and the doctor said that it was nothing. I had them for about a week and then one day I almost passed out in the parking of my electric company and I was taken to the ER. Come to find out I had a blood clot in my lung. I do not trust doctors. If I have a illness I will try and fix it myself.
0.440000	I don't really trust my doctor very much because i feel that sometimes they are too caught up in all the drug company's ideas that certain medicines work for thing they don't or are trying to perscribe medicines due to kick backs from companys
0.760000	I've been seeing my PCP mostly for anxiety issues and so because we've talked about the reasons why the anxiety might be happening, she was very understanding and informative.
0.640000	For the most part, I trust in doctors, but I've run into situations where they are giving the minimal amount of treatment so they can be done with me and move on to the next patient.
0.680000	I trust her for the most part except when I had my first kid she didn't figure out ahead of time that my baby was breech so I ended up having an unexpected C-section. 
0.640000	She is there for me when I need her. She does not rush through appointments with me. She explains everything and makes sure that I understand. She is knowledgeable about current trends in health care.
0.800000	I have been with the same doctor for 11 years and he has never given me any reason to not trust him - he is very thorough and concise in his diagnoses and gives me the best overall advice and information that I could ever hope for with any doctor. 
0.800000	I chose my doctor out of a few that I've visited over the years. She's always eager to answer questions and is professiol, all the while still having a kind demeanor.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she's willing to answer questions. I don't ever feel she's rushing me or dismissing my concerns. If I ask about altertives she gives a lot of facts - I like to hear it all and not generalized statements meant to pacify.
0.960000	Very caring doctor. She is non-judgemental.
0.640000	I distrust doctors because they work for big companies and the companies are in it to make money therefore the doctors have to find a way to make that money.
1.000000	She has always been very thorough in her explations and care. She has also always made my options very clear to me.
0.720000	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  But I know that we are all human and humans make mistakes.
0.920000	I have known my PCP since I was 13 and friends with his daughter. I am usually very healthy and don't go to the doctor very often, but I do trust him as my doctor. 
1.000000	i have had him for 11 years and never once has he not taken my questions or worries with seriousness.
1.000000	FIRST, HE IS WELL EDUCATED AND HAS TAKEN AN OATH.   SECOND, I DID RESEARCH ABOUT HIM AND HIS BACKGROUND.  ALSO, I CAN TELL BY HIS PERSOLITY AND TALKING WITH JIM.
0.800000	Well I think you have to trust that your doctor knows more than you do and is trying to do what is best for you. My doctor always explains all of my options and makes recommendations but still asks for my input as well. I trust he wants to do what is best for me.
0.280000	As of late, my doctor has been pretty dismissive of my health concerns. He is very busy and spends almost no time evaluating me. Because of this, I am currently searching for a new doctor. I feel that he does not take what I have to say seriously. 
0.880000	When I had Kaiser, I didn't trust them at all. They prescribed Codine for every little thing that I had. Now I have a private doctor through PPO and they are spot on, I'm always feeling better, I never feel like I get the run around. This difference can make my answers fill mixed. But if you were to ask me how I felt between HMO and PPO health care, it would be a landslide of an opinion.
0.800000	I have been with my primary physician for years and we have built up a rapport. He has never given me a diagnosis that I felt was wrong to real degree. Even if I did not have my own trusted doctor, I believe that it is in a doctor's best interest to provide the best care possible, so it is easy for me to trust a doctor.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has been doing this a long time. Also, he went to medical school, not me!
0.760000	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable about the field of medicine than I am, so I listen to them.
0.880000	I have done a lot of research and tried several different doctors in the the surrounding cities until I landed with one who I trust greatly. 
0.760000	I usually trust doctors. I think it's pretty risky for them to be deceitful. In my experience, doctors are honest and kind and smart.
0.800000	He's the expert. I don't know much about medicine, so I don't have much choice. Additiolly, he's always been open and honest with me about my treatment options, side effects, etc.
0.960000	I feel based on the information in front of them they make the best decision possible.  I think if they do not know they are at least diligent about sending you onto a specialist, or double checking things like lab work, etc. to rule things out and make sure nothing serious is going on.
0.800000	My doctor has been my doctor for over ten years. He is never rushed and always takes time to answer my questions and concerns.  I like that he values my input and will look up things that I tell him about.  He seems genuinely concerned about my care.  He is easy to talk to.
0.440000	Doctors are influenced by the number they can put on your bill.  If it costs more they'll recommend it.  Also pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to push their drugs over something that may be more appropriate for my condition.
0.560000	they have a duty to do their job at least competently, but i don't know my PCP very well so I can't really make a persol judgment, my doctor seems pretty busy and rushes me a lot
0.800000	Most of the doctors I have been in contact with recently seemed to have my best care in mind. I recently hurt my shoulder and needed to go to the Orthopedic Surgeon for car. While I had not been to this Ortho before, he was very thorough and explained the cost/benefits of the treatment plan he had set for me. However, I find that interacting with other medical staff, such as psychiatrists, RNs, LPNs, that they are much more business-oriented, in and out. For those types of specialists/general staff I do not have as much trust as I do my PCP or Ortho.
0.800000	I have a long-standing patient/doctor relationship with my doctor. She is trustworthy and thorough, and always takes time to ask me in-depth questions and relate to me on a human level.
0.800000	I trust the doctor and I rely on their education and experience.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has yet to give me any false or misleading information. He spends time talking to me and doesn't rush me out of the door. Listens to my concerns/questions and answers them well
1.000000	He is very open to answering my questions and spending time explaining things. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he has proven trustworthy.  He listens to what I have to say and develops treatment plans based on what he believes the issue is.  He treats the problem and not the symptoms.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. However, I recognize that she is very busy, probably over-worked, and cannot take the time she, herself, would like to devote to her patients. It is not her fault how quickly she has to work and I know that she does the best job she can do given the situation. 
0.800000	She goes out of her way to make sure I feel comfortable and to see if anything else is wrong. She tells me things about herself if she has similar problems to make me feel better about my issues. 
0.720000	She seems like a good doctor. I don't have any complaints. If she thought something was wrong I'm sure she'd tell me.
0.600000	My primary care physician keeps leaving and I haven't met the new one, but I think they are fine. I worry that I don't know what a patient is supposed to do.
0.880000	My doctor makes sure to spend an adequate amount of time with me to ensure i can have all the questions i have answered. They don't rush me and even if they feel a test doesn't need to be done, they will do it anyways just to make sure.
0.360000	My primary care doctor never ask me what I want or how I feel about a treatment, she just tells me what to do. She wanted me to remove my gallbladder but never asked me if I was ok with it or if there were altertives. I cured myself with limonene. I feel i no longer need her help most of the time.
0.480000	I've only recently started seeing her. I had an issue wrong and I feel like instead of truly trying to figure out what was wrong , she just sent me out for any test she felt could possibly solve it for her. Then when the tests didn't work, she was quickly done with me and wanted to refer me out. She has also put me on some questioble medications for this without explaining fully the side effects or that I could have a bad reaction to one of them.
0.360000	I do not think that he like women or respects them as much as men. I feel like he talks to my husband with respect and caring but dismisses me when I try to tell him my mental health issues.
0.680000	I have seen my primary care doctor for almost thirty years and have complete faith in him for my medical health. He know me extremely well and is well regarded in the community for his thorough manner.
0.480000	He is usually in a hurry when I go to see him. I imagine that is because he sees so many patients. Since I see him rarely, I imagine there isn't enough of a connection for him to really care outside a professiol capacity.
0.440000	I think they just come up with explations to get you out faster
0.960000	Always takes the time to explain things in detail and answer questions, never rushes me and believes in finding the cause and not just treating the symptom
0.760000	I have been seeing this doctor for some time for a serious illness. So far they have maged it quite well so I trust their judgement
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been able to help me. I have been going to the same doctor since I was a teeger.
0.600000	I dont think I've ever trusted a doctor completely. When I see them taking meetings with pharm reps and so many patients they only have about 5-10 minutes with each, I dont feel very confident about everything they say and do. They seem to go on vacation a lot too.
0.760000	My doctor is a seasoned professiol. He has really good persol qualities. That makes me feel will do no harm when it comes to his medical advice.
0.760000	I feel doctors truly care for their patients and want the best for them.
0.240000	I think they are too much influenced by money, corruption and big pharma. 
1.000000	I've been going to the same doctor for years. He is very kind and shows that he actually cares about my wellbeing. He is never in a hurry and explains everything to me in a way that I can understand.
0.720000	Because I feel like they should know what is best for you and if they explain all the options and consequences then they are more trustworthy.
0.680000	I don't trust him because a few years ago he prescribed medication for high blood pressure that almost killed me. The side-affects were so bad I had to go into the er room.
0.400000	I distrust my doctor because I go to the VA for my healthcare and they really don't seem to hire or keep the best of medical providers there. They are always in a rush and don't seem to really care to give the time of day to your problems they are all very low quality providers. So, that is why I do not trust my physician. 
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician for the most part, I have only meet her once. I am still working on putting my complete trust in her. I completely trusted my previous doctor since I had been with her for many years. Switching made me uneasy. But I trust in her and her education. 
0.760000	I usually trust my primary care physician because I know he cares about my health. He usually takes the time to explain things thoroughly if he feels like I don't understand them.
0.840000	I've been seeing the same doctor for a long time. He knows by medical history very well. He's a very friendly man who doesn't rush through appointments, and really does listen to my concerns. I've grown to trust him very much and feel he makes good decisions for my health.
0.560000	Honestly, I trust doctors to a certain extent as far as diagnosing a problem, but I think their treatment options are generally given according to what makes them the most money. 
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has always been right about what treatments I need over the years, and he has been my doctor for a long time. Since he has never been wrong, I feel that I can trust him. 
0.720000	My doctor seems to care about me when I visit. She does not contact me often, but when I need help she is helpful.
0.560000	They try to rush during a visit and get to the next patient as soon as possible.
0.560000	I trust doctors to be careful and thorough, but a good bit of skepticism is healthy, and getting a second opinion is wise. It is difficult to put complete trust in someone I don't really know.
0.600000	it is neutural, because sometimes where I am from they just want a quick fix  and try to just take care of the issue as quick as they can
0.720000	Because I know him very well. And he is a very knowledgeable person also.
0.320000	No one should completely trust a doctor. He has an invested reason to tell you all these things that you can do without. His pockets get bigger when he gets you to do more things that are not needed. 
0.800000	I feel that my doctor does all that they can to provide me the best healthcare. I have never felt that they were being dishonest with me. They alwayws are open to my questions and doubts.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she has shown me, over the years, that she has my best interest at heart. She listens to me and my concerns and together we come up with a plan to take care of whatever problem I am experiencing at that time.
0.360000	I don't currently have a primary care physician. My last one, who I'd see once a year for a basic check-in and a prescription refill for my anti-anxiety med, told me last year not to come back anymore because I'm uninsured (stuck in a state-caused ACA loophole) and can't afford more in-depth exams. Being told something like that kind of dented my trust in medical professiols in general.
0.760000	There is no real motivation for a doctor not to do what is best for you. He or she will get paid the same regardless of the outcome of your medical situation so there is no reason for the doctor to screw you over. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been super honest and up front with me. He has always taken the time to explain everything that needs to be explained and he has never hidden anything from me when it comes to my medical conditions or illnesses. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor because she knows that sometimes treatment options work differently for different people and she lets me know that I might not get the results I want but she has always been willing to work with me when I need to change a treatment option without hesitation. 
0.760000	My doctor seems genuine and intelligent. She generally provides me with a range of options before prescribing a particular one. She seems heartfelt and concerned, and takes time to talk with me.
1.000000	He lets me be a part of the plan of treatment and always asks what I think aand if I agree or disagree. He always takes the time to listen and is very willing to see me whenever i need him too. He explains everything to me in a way that I understand and is very patient, kind and gentle. is office always calls to see how I am doing.
0.760000	She takes the time to explain things and answer any questions I might have.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him. He is looking out for my best interests. He takes his time to listen to me. He is never rushed - or at least doesn't show it. He is friendly and helpful and I trust him.
0.760000	I feel she is very thorough.  She has done more tests on me then previous doctors, and usually has answers for me on any questions I have.
0.680000	I am not completely happy with my current physician. He tends to rush patients in and out of the office, spending very little time. I always feel rushed and try to obtain the most important information first. I feel like my physician always looks for the quick and easy answer instead of spending time looking into something more seriously.
0.720000	Dr's goto medical school so they know their health. Sometimes people dont want to hear that they are sick so they might want to disagree with the Dr. to feel better in a sense of denial. I think medical school vs. no school its better to trust the dr.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because I trust the profession. I appreciate that he explains things alytically, which is consistent with the way I process information.
0.880000	My doctor has been working in the field for a long time, so I trust her. I can also tell from her tone of voice that she really cares about the welfare of her patients, so I can trust her 100%. 
0.760000	I have just started with her, but she seems to be communicative, alytical, takes time to explain, moderately to highly intelligent, sympathetic, and experienced.
0.920000	They have always been helpful and informative. I've never had a problem  talking with them. They are respectful and I feel I can talk honestly to them.
0.800000	"My doctor always suggests tural remedies first if the condition is not serious. She is not a ""pill pusher"" like most. My mother used to work with her also. She is also my mother's doctor now that she no longer works with her."
1.000000	He has my interest and always keeps me aware of my health and what I should be aware of as I grow older. The things we must do to keep me healthy
0.920000	love my doctor. Explains everything really well and understands me. 
0.600000	I have trust in his ability as a doctor and his medical doctor, but he is a very busy doctor in a poor neighborhood, so it can be hard to keep his attention on something that doesn't seem very bad from an outside perspective. 
0.800000	My physician seems like they are well educated and seem to communicate well with other people. Their ability to portray information to me is critical in deserving my trust, and I have had no problems at all regarding this. I feel that most doctors are so well educated that they have a good idea what is going on and how to treat it, and they can get more information readily if necessary, so overall I trust them due to their education and ability to communicate.
0.760000	I don't have a PCP, but do feel that most doctors are looking out for their patients' best interests and can be trusted.
0.800000	He always seems to care about my health. He takes time to explain and talk to me. 
0.800000	i trust my physical because if there is any problem at any time of the day, i know she will be there for me. 
0.480000	I think doctors are always pushing big pharma agendas of the latest most expensive drugs in return for kickbacks.
0.800000	I find that my pcp takes her time when examining and listens to what I am saying. She is stern about certain things but does not push unnecessary treatments or procedures. 
0.720000	I know that doctors aren't perfect, but they go through one of the most rigorous schooling systems of any profession. If they don't know the answer then nobody does.
0.240000	I have a terrible list of back problems and the doctor is afraid to give me anything stronger because of all of the opiod addiction in the country, even though I've never done anything wrong. so he keeps giving me expensive medicines that don't work and wont listen to me when i talk to him. he seems in a hurry to get me out of the office.  
0.600000	I mostly trust my doctor, except when he seems to have more patients on his plate than what he can handle with the utmost care at the moment. Sometimes my appointments feel rather rushed and I know he has not had adequate time to alyze every possible solution to whatever problem I may be dealing with, and that he is simply giving the fastest and easiest solution rather than the best one. I know that he is competent and knowledgeable and has always taken care of me, but I wonder sometimes if better care and more close attention is available elsewhere. 
0.760000	I have great trust in doctors because it takes a lot to become one. Lots of school lots of practice and lots of experience make for great helpers.
0.280000	because my doctor has been inconsistent in his actions and negligent in his recommendations 
0.680000	usually he gives me good advice.But sometimes they put you on meds with to many's side effects.
0.880000	In the above I was talking about my OBGYN. I have to see him often for complications and cancer screenings. He is always straight forward with me, and has actually saved my life twice. 
1.000000	Ive been seeing this doctor for a long time and she actually happens to be a relative through marriage many many years ago so i have no reason to believe she would be completely honest so i am the same with her
0.760000	I completely trust this doctor because two years ago I had a knot in my neck, and right away I went to see my Primary Care Doctor. After examining the knot, and telling him my other symptoms, he did not beat around the bush, he sent me directly to a specialist who then biopsied the knot, and it turned out to be cancer. This doctor does not waste my time or his, and cares deeply about his patients.
0.640000	My doctor is really smart and does care, so I trust that they're not going to offer me something I don't need. At the same time, they're pretty dismissive and patronizing, so that's a little discouraging.
0.640000	i don't know them well and they're a conventiol doctor who wants to deal with symptoms rather than root causes, which isn't something i agree with. i do my own research and speak with a relative who is a doctor as well.
0.800000	He has saved my life on one occasion and my daughter's life in another. He is very thorough and helpful. I have been seeing him for over 25 years. He knows me. 
0.240000	Doctors seem very disinterested and distant. They don't seem to fully take my complaints into account and they always seem in a rush to get me out as fast as possible. I hate being treated that way. 
0.600000	I believe that the doctor does know better than me about medical treatment. However, I also know that there are incentives in providing certain options over others, and cultural biases that pervade the doctors perceptions (as well as my own).
0.680000	I trust my doctor. He's been thorough in diagnosing issues. He's open communication and will try different things in order to assist me
0.760000	I am not smart enough to not trust my doctor completely. I don't go to the doctor that often, but when I do I take them at face value. They have never steered me wrong when I have needed them in the past.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because whenever I have questions that need to be answered he is always willing to answer them honestly and right away and he always gives me all the info I need when I go to him.
0.800000	They have gone to school to learn what they are doing and I have been going to them for a while and learned to trust what they have to say.  I have a good comfort level with them, and if you can't trust your doctor, you should change them.
0.880000	I trust my physician because I have been working with him for a long time now. I almost see him as a friend. I can get persol with him and not have to worry because I trust him. In addition, he is very soft spoken and experienced. Overall, I would rate my doctor a 4/5.
1.000000	I have known her all my life she is my best friend that happens to be my doctor
0.960000	My doctor takes her time to listen to my concerns and is not in a rush to get me out the door.
0.520000	i mostly trust my doctors but I need to double check through independent research to have full confidence
0.720000	I mostly trust my doctor. Though, he is a person just like others with flaws.
0.440000	I have had experiences with Workers Comps doctors who only care about workers comp and not my well being.
0.800000	I've had her for 2 years and she'll always take the time to explain things to me and seems genuinely concerned. Since I'm on medicare not all doctors seem to think I'm not worth their time. That hasn't happened too much though. 
0.440000	i am aware of how they push medications that are provided them by certain pharmeceutical companies.  i also have witnessed first hand a doctor going to his office after assessing patient, and consulting with an encyclopedia to see what the patient has.  I think doctors are smart, but sometimes I think we give them too much credit.  They have to remember a ton of shit.
0.960000	I completely trust my primary care physician because they take the take and answer all my questions. They let me know what I'm doing wrong about anything and lead me in the right path about my health. 
0.680000	My doctor seems always pressed for time everytime I go there. He rushes me in/out without really talking in depth. But he seems to know what he's doing, so I sort of trust him. I will speak up next time it bothers me.
0.800000	My doctor listens to me. She tells me te tests I should get and talks about my weight.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for several years, and he has always provided me with great care, and I have never had an issues with any of his decisions/ diagnoses. He has a good record of quality and care.
0.640000	My doctor is very knowledgeable but he sees many patients each day. I feel that he can make mistakes from time to time.
0.760000	I trust him because he is persoble and lets me tell him what I am comfortable with and not. He isn't pushy, but will always do what is best for his patients.
0.600000	I trust my doctor, but I understand that she has pressures and influences that may not lead to the best care for me. I believe a patient must take an active part in their own care if possible.
0.720000	I trust them for the most part. I haven't had any issues where they were wrong. Most of my experiences with doctors have resulted in proper solutions for why I was there.
0.680000	I do believe my doctor is honest, thorough, and careful for the most part. I think sometimes time constrictions can force her to be a little less thorough, especially when it comes to explaining why she is choosing a certain treatment. At times, I have trouble trusting doctors because I don't understand how they know the treatment they have chosen will work.
0.800000	There's no reason for me not to trust my doctor. I haven't had any ill experiences, and she always seems willing to answer any questions that I may have in regards to procedures or medications.
0.600000	I don't go to the doctor often, but they are more knowledgeable than me so I believe them
0.520000	Dr's work and are obligated to the pharma business. That is their main goal, patients are secondary.
0.680000	I've had a few doctors and most i feel cared about me, but sometimes i did feel like they weren't putting their full thoughts into correct treatments.  Sometimes they'll let a problem sit and see if it fixes itself, or sometimes they'll try to do whatever would be easier for them if it does require prescribing something.
0.600000	I feel like a doctor's office is a business like any other.  They are looking to help people but with a way that will also maximize their profits.
0.640000	He seems to know what he is talking about most of the time, but he doesn't explain things in detail that I can understand. I have trouble keeping up at times so sometimes I don't think he wants to see me anymore. I trust that he knows what he is talking about, but it all just flies over my head. 
0.800000	I've been seeing them for most of my life since I was a young child.  I believe they've always treated me with their best interest and care.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because so far he hasn't done anything to erode my trust for him. I am wary of my physician when he tells me treatment methods. This is more so because I am a cautious person.
0.600000	I am not sure about those decisions since I only go to my doctor for annual check these years
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because she as highly rated in my state, she has cared for 5 other of my family members, knows my entire medical family history better than I do, and she is very comforting and kind. She always explains everything I need to know, is very thorough and makes me feel comfortable with asking any questions.
0.960000	I trust my doctor, but not completely. I do not, as a rule, trust Doctors in general. They all seem to start out good people, but most of them become greedy, and want to fix everything with pills. There is more to fixing someone than just pills.There is a job to do, most Doctors are not doing it properly.
0.840000	I feel those called to such a high involvement with the human condition deserve our respect and ultimately admiration. The rigors of their study and training predispose them to being credible.
0.960000	My doctors have saved my life, and I believe that they do an outstanding job.
0.720000	I trust my Doctor because i feel that he geunuinely cares about serving me properly, and has my best interests in mind. He has told me that he wanted to be a psychologist after he finished his Medical Degree, but it is too late now.
0.800000	I have been seeing my PCP for many years. Since I am in good health, we rarely have issues requiring lots of medical direction or intervention. However, in the conversations we have had, I trust his judgment and expertise. He has always been straightforward with me about illnesses and treatment.
0.920000	I tend to trust my Dr and their opinions because I have disclosed all the symptoms that I have been experiencing therefor I believe they can accurately provide me with a diagnosis.  I also believe that my Dr is also looking out for my best interest.
0.560000	In some ways I feel they push drugs on you because they get a cut of it.  Some doctors just rush though with you and move onto the next patient for money.  
0.880000	 I trust my doctor as he has never steered me wrong.  I have no reason to believe that he would or that he would be not being honest with me.
0.640000	My dr. explains my options and asks me which I want to do. She will offer her opinion on what she thinks is the best option for me but ultimately it is my decision. However, she and I disagree on the usefulness of supplements. I think it's helpful to take the ones that I do and she disagrees. I don't completely trust her because of this.
0.720000	my dr is easy going but very honest. he tell you what you need to do to get better . he doesn't seem snobby like some drs.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest with me and has always given me clear direction. He has never pushed any drugs or treatments on me that would be unnecessary. He is very thorough and complete when I go in to visit. He makes me feel very comfortable when I am with him, and I never leave his office feeling confused. 
0.880000	Most of the time I feel like I can trust my doctor. He obviously knows more about health than I do. I don't think he would steer my care in the wrong direction, and it never seems like he is trying to push some unneeded treatment on me for something silly (i.e. restless leg syndrome or something like that) that would make me think he is being paid a commission by pharmaceuticals.
0.800000	I have always been completely satisfied with my Doctor. Always thorough gives me the goods and the bads and tells me it straight forward not holding back 
0.600000	I can't put all of my trust in what a doctor says until I meet them.  If they take their time treating me and looking for a solution then I can trust in what they are saying.  If they are late and then come in the room, in a rush, then I have difficulty trusting them.  They typically tend to rush through looking over me and seeking a solution to what is wrong.
0.840000	They have gone above and beyond to check in with me after appointments and procedures. They seem genuinely concerned about any issues I am having. I feel like the believe me when I have pain and are not dismissive of any condition. 
0.680000	My primary care physician is very kind and listens to my problems, so I have high confidence and trust in him.
0.800000	My primary care physician is very nice woman. She knows a lot, always friendly, and ready to give me any explation I need.
0.760000	I have a new primary care doctor, but she is kind and well-respected. I trust her based on others' experiences and honest reviews, in addition to persol experience. 
0.480000	my old doctor was wonderful he explained everything in a way someone could understand and he was nice and cared.  He got a new job with the government and now I go to his partner he had at the practice.  The new doctor (old doctors partner) doesn't care...he just wants to get you in and out of there fast.
0.920000	I trust my doctor to evaluate me and to be honest with me. He is very good at referring me to other good doctors and I trust him to do this.
0.680000	I do trust my doctor, she seems very informed, and she never takes a guess unless she is sure. I appreciate how organized and detail-oriented she is. My reservations mostly come from my hesitation to fully trust in another person. While medicine has been revolutionized, it is still not an exact science, and things can go wrong at any moment, so while I do trust my doctor, I am not sure I would ever 100% accept everything they told me without some reservations about their correct diagnosis. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years.  If it were a new doctor I might be a little more hesitant in my trust of them especially if I may not agree with their thoughts or approach.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he is very experienced. He is very sincere and honest with me. He is very down to earth and tells me like it is, regardless of how I feel.
0.440000	My doctor always seems like he's in a rush and doesn't seem like he is always concerned about answering all my questions. I think he is more concerned about getting done with each patient quickly. 
0.720000	My doctor seems in a hurry. I think my doctor does not care for me because I refuse treatments for things like the Flu shot. He seems in a rush to get to the next patient. He says things that are contradictory and confusing to me without leaving time for me to follow up on what he said.
0.760000	I trust doctors because I think they genuinely care about treating their patients. They have high reputations and they don't want to risk diagnosing something wrong. 
1.000000	I have had the same doctor that my dad has been using.  She has been our family doctor for 20 years, and really helped a lot in some trying times.  She is simply the best.
0.600000	I had a 3 month cough, I was told it would get better on its own.
0.760000	My doctor is always pleasant and seems to be treating me fairly. We have not had any issues. I came from a primary care doctor that I did not have any trust for, so this seems like a huge improvement to me. 
0.560000	I go to a primary care physician at a school health center and I think that he is on a tight schedule, and has a lot of patients each day that limits his time to spend diagnosing my problems. 
0.840000	I have been seeing my doctor for a couple of years and she is thorough and trusting.  She is always ready to listen to my concerns.  She addresses preventative medicine with a passion.
0.800000	My doctor is awesome. He's smart and funny but he is also serious when he needs to be. He has always been honest with me and given me many options on what to do next and how to proceed. In almost every single case of him suggesting something, that has been the right suggestion, whether I took his advice or didn't. 
0.720000	I have a good doctor, it's his sense of humor. He is like a comedy central roast comedian, it fun but it make think more about my health 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has shown me that he can be trusted. I have been going to him for many years now and he has helped me a lot over that time.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for a long time now. I've experienced good results and up till now I only have positive reviews. 
0.960000	I recently changed physicians to a female doctor and feel that she understands me better than the male doctor. I feel I can trust what she says and like her communication style. 
0.600000	I would hope they was tell me the truth about everything 
0.520000	I trust doctors because I know that they care for me. I know that they only want the best for me.
0.600000	I trust doctors like I trust policemen: i was brought up to trust them
0.840000	I am able to easily talk to my doctor about issues I may have. She is very thorough and takes the time to answers my questions in a way I understand. I appreciate this.
0.480000	I think sometimes they care more about money than actually helping people.
0.560000	Sometimes he seems rushed and he might get benefits from recommending certain treatment to me, so I try to assess things objectively.
0.440000	I feel like doctors get commission for prescriptions that vendors tell them to sell, like hey sell 10 of these and we'll give you 1k, so all these doctors all they do is prescribe shit 
0.480000	I think in many occassions this is a result of a bad system. I have yet to see a real benefit for a physician to make me healthy. In most cases the physician is looking to see me, diagnose me, treat me, and get me out the door in a short window. With this model there is very little time to have a real conversation about me and my overall health.  
0.800000	They have shown me options that don't cost me money at all. Something that I can do on my own to help deal with issues I may have. His last resort would be additiol treatment or medication. 
0.960000	I like my doctor. He is very intelligent and I have been going to him for years. 
0.440000	I just started with a new PCP and have only seen him once, but I didn't like him and probably won't go back. He was dismissive of all of my health concerns. I've been taking blood pressure meds for years and going off of one blood pressure reading he declared that I didn't need them anymore. I was complaining of aneurysm-like pain in an extremely small spot of my head and he ignored that completely.
0.360000	I have been to my primary care physician twice in two years. The first time they refused to give me the full battery of STD tests I wanted. I had no reason to believe I contracted anything, but because I am non-monogamous I wanted to be responsible, and because I have a phobia of needles and needed a blood draw I figured I'd get all the blood drawing out of the way at once. I had to fight with my doctor and two secretaries for the paperwork, and then when I got my results 3 months later (great processing time - NOT) they STILL hadn't tested for anything! Planned Parenthood handles this sort of thing SO much better than a fricking Catholic Healthcare system. 
0.640000	I am pretty neutral with doctors - it is their job to tell me what is wrong, but most of the time, I already know what is wrong with myself. Ideally, I'd like to just get a solution to the problem from what I tell the doctors, instead of having to go through the process of them telling me what I already know. 
0.720000	My primary care physician has never given me any reason to doubt her practices. She has always shown both compassion and knowledge. 
1.000000	i feel my doctor always has my best instrest in mind because he always fixes my problems. i trust him 100%.
0.880000	I've known my primary care doctor for a long time already. He is a family friend, the husband of my mother's coworker. As a result, my trust in him is very high. 
0.600000	I would hope for the most part, they are honest with me and I can trust them, but you hear of so many things that happen, and they are so pressed for time usually, that I am always afraid they don't tell you everything in the limited amount of time you are there. My husband recently had to get something done, and they convenient left out some of the adverse side effects.
0.680000	The physician I see has years of experience along with a degree in subjects I have never even thought about taking. They are more knowledgable in what they are doing then i would never be, in return i would believe what they say. 
0.400000	I feel like there have been other treatment options that my doctor didn't tell me about because they got extra money for getting me on something they were in business with.
1.000000	I've been going to the same doctor for 12 years and I completely trust her opinion. She takes her time with me and listens to everything I say. Since I had my children, she also cares for them and does a great job with them.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. She is very thorough and follows up on any concerns I may have. If she is not familiar with something, she researches it so that she can better help me.
0.720000	I have been to many primary care doctors in the past. Because of this, I have gotten to know who is a good doctor and who is not. My current primary care physician is very helpful and caring. She never rushes me and spends as much time as I need answering my questions. She is also familiar with my condition, so I trust her in giving me the correct dosing for my medication. She is also empathic and can explain things in a way that makes sense. 
0.600000	"My current doctor is better than doctors I've had in the past, and he has been able to help me more; he listens to me more. Unfortutely he has some attitudes about certain newer medical conditions--one of which I almost certainly have--that makes it hard us to really ""connect."" He does discuss treatment plans with me on the things he CAN help me with, though."
0.760000	I find my doctor to be very trustworthy. He is open and honest with me and make things easy to understand.
0.200000	He did not provided all the answers I needed. It took him less than 5 minutes to see me and guess what's wrong with me. I felt like I visited a quack. I spent 100 dollars in which I can diagnose myself online for free.
0.400000	"I never get the sense that my doctor really cares about me. I feel like she is just ""punching the clock"" and not engaged in my healthcare."
0.440000	My doctor is very well intentioned, but he will opt for conventiol medicine without turning to lifestyle choices first. For example, he would immediately prescribe a statin rather than addressing food choices first. He would prescribe a thyroid drug without first asking if one is eating a lot of sea vegetables or other high-iodine foods. He recommends mammograms despite the evidence that they really don't save lives (in the aggregate), they simply make more people patients.
0.680000	I do not know.  I have not gone to a primary care physician in 17 years.
0.800000	i trust him because when i have been to the doctor he has diagnosed my condition and treated it effectively with a few exceptions.  I don't like to go to the doctor though and if i can still function with my illness i will try to ignore it until it goes away.
0.480000	I had a doctor I could trust but when we moved to a new state several years ago, I haven't found one I could trust here. I've found larger medical practices where the doctors are in a hurry and you usually end up seeing someone different every time you go.
1.000000	I've been seeing my doctor for a number of years and she has never been anything but honest with me. If she doesn't know the answer to one of my questions, she will admit that and then help me find the answer. She always takes her time and goes over everything with me thoroughly, and I never feel rushed when I am in her office. She knows quite a bit about my persol life and always asks me about my family when I come in. I feel like we are friends.
0.440000	Doctors are human just like I am.  Some are good, some are bad.  It is up to me to question what I'm told and help find solutions.  If they won't work with me I'll find someone else.
1.000000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. I have always had a good experience with them. They are thoughtful and clear and always make sure I have my questions answered.
0.800000	My PCP is a very reliable man. He listens to me when I report symptoms and places an importance on my physical and mental health, my overall well-being. He has expressed concern for my health and has instructed me to follow necessary steps to becoming healthier in my everyday life. I appreciate and respect his feedback, and I know that he is looking out for my best interest.
0.680000	Doctors are only people. While highly trained and educated, it is important to make decisions based on what is best for me, the patient. 
0.520000	I have went thru a few primary care physicians in the last 2  years. I've had trouble finding one that wants to listen and help me with my problems. They always seems like they are rude, in a hurry or just push me off on to a specialist. Thats not what I want. 
0.760000	My doctor is very concerned about my questions and always listens to me so that help me develop trust.
0.800000	My doctor listens to my concerns and explains things thoroughly. If I have a concern, my doctor makes other options available and reassures me.
0.960000	My doctor is very experienced.  I can tell much about my doctor by his mannerisms.
0.920000	Perhaps it's because I haven't had a severe condition that has caused me to question my doctor's judgment, but I have had only positive interactions with my PCP and have received appropriate treatments. I am always given the chance to talk about my problems and able to ask questions. I never feel as though I'm being rushed out the door on an assembly line to make room for another patient, but that I am being treated by someone who is interested in getting to the root of my health problem.
0.880000	I normally trust my doctor but I do have ideas of my own for treatment when I think I can use something more tural vs pharmaceutical. 
0.560000	I live in a small town and our doctors are not known for having the best track record for getting diagnosis correct.  We usually use our Primary Care Physician as a way to get to a specialist for a true diagnosis.  I do not let my children go to a local doctor, if they are ill we travel over an hour to take them to a pediatrician's office in a larger city.  
0.680000	I trust doctors because they have a lot of medical knowledge. Their assessments and recommendations usually work for me. I've never had a serious problem with a doctor that would make me lose faith in them.
0.800000	I just like him and he is knowledgeable.  I can always research on the internet.  He answers my questions and is patient and kind.
0.760000	i dont have other choice, im not a doctor
0.800000	I just made a appointment with my primary I had never seen him or any primary but I thought of my gynecologist who I've seen for years. I trust her because she has kept me healthy and is very polite. She is easy to talk to.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he gives me good advise and when I am having an issue , he is always helpful . He explains to me what to do and what are my best options to feeling better. 
0.720000	I do trust the doctors I see for the most part. In a few cases it seems that they are not engaging with me emotiolly. If I feel emotiol connected to a doctor I am more likely to trust them
0.640000	He is honest and caring.  However, he is not entirely well versed in health issues outside his specialty.  He has made mistakes before and shown that he does not  know how to do certain procedures.  He is good at interl medicine but not at neurology .
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor, or any doctor wholly because I do feel as though they are all about the money in most cases. 
1.000000	"I have known him my entire life, and he is a second father to me - very, very close family friends who helped raise me. He is calm, ratiol, compassiote, and works with patients by listening to what they know is going on in their own bodies, what's ""normal"" for them, etc, instead of railroading them. Pharma reps have 0 influence on him - he is above reproach morally. He's going to retire soon and I don't know what I'm going to do!"
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him.  He has also gone above and beyond in taking care of the rest of my family, including handling a couple of emergency situations wonderfully.
0.520000	sometimes I think my doctor tries to make money off of the medicine he prescribes for me. I've been recommended some medication that could help but wasn't quite necessary. Persol fincial gain is a problem I find with some doctors.
0.720000	We all are human with all possible mistakes. I like to have second or even third opinion almost always.
0.280000	I've had many bad persol experiences with physicians in the past. Several have initially denied treatment because they didn't think their patient (my wife) was acting in enough pain for her condition that they eventually correctly diagnosed and medicated. Many have been uble to diagnose fairly common conditions. One LITERALLY told me the video game Street Fighter caused demons to come out of my TV and give me a skin rash that was later properly diagnosed as scabies. That is not a joke, or me having a go at the survey. That actually happened. Many doctors only seem to care about money, many don't care about their patients. I have had a few positive experiences as well, but as I lack a permanent primary care physician I've not had many positive experiences.
0.680000	My doctor is great and I trust him and his judgement. However, I always verify things for myself and do my own research as my doctor can never have the knowledge of my health history that I do - so he might miss something. 
0.800000	I feel I get many explations throughout any of my appointments that educate me on what is happening and why at all times.  It is very helpful to be able to feel educated. 
0.800000	My physician always takes the time out to answer my questions and explain things. She is very honest and blunt.
0.760000	My doctor is persoble and down to earth and makes going to the doctor easy. She is also very up front about different options and treatments and doesn't give her own opinion of the product but what might work best for the individual.
0.480000	"In past experiences, visits to my primary physician have resulted in absolutely nothing. ""Take this medication"" is pretty much the only advice I receive. "
0.840000	Generally I always trust people. My doctor cares for me. So I always trust him.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them since I was young. My whole family goes to the same practice and we have had a lot of positive experiences and received good health care.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he is a family friend. He would tell me the truth about whatever I see him for. I believe he would anyways because it is not worth it for him to lie to anyone. There is so much information out there that doctors can quickly be checked if they are not telling the truth or are incompetent. 
0.640000	I trust doctors in general, but sometimes if the place is busy I might feel like they don't care very much about me but more about moving to the next person. I don't like it when doctors don't seem to care about a more persol engagement.
0.400000	I know he receives samples from pharm reps. I also know that is what I'll be walking out of his office with. 
1.000000	My doctor has never wronged me. He is very friendly and always answers my questions. He genuinely cares about my health and his solutions have always worked.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she takes her time when she is seeing me, she is knowledgeable, smart, kind, caring, wants to help me whenever I am sick or need to discuss something with her. She always has my best interest and in mind when she is tending to my health needs.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because he has helped me whenever I went there with a problem. He has always figured out what the issue was and alleviated the symptom. He is also good at making things easy to understand so I would not be confused.
0.800000	My doctor doesn't seem like a bad guy. He doesn't push any medicines or products on me, so it doesn't seem like he's benefitting in any way that would make him disregard my care.
0.800000	I pick doctors that really care about good outcomes and satisfied patients. Also, if a doctor gives the hint that he/she isn't doing the right thing I will question and leave if necessary.
0.400000	I feel that medicine is a business and not a one on one profession.   The doctor tries to make money off you.
0.960000	He's been my doctor for years. Whenever something is wrong, we can general figure out a fix. If there's ever problem we can't work through together, he sends me to a specialist.
0.760000	I believe that they have my best interest in mind. They want to do the best for me that they can.
0.880000	My primary care physician is kind and answers any questions that I may have. He is also very careful and mostly remembers when I last visit him. I think he cares a lot about his patients.
0.560000	I dont have a strong persol relationship with my doctor so I can't really say that they have my best interest in mind. I'm sure they dont want to actively harm me but I don't know if they really care that much. 
0.800000	He has been a family friend for many years and is always up front and kind about everything. I've never had an issue where he has not been correct about a medical issue. He treats me very professiolly at all times.
0.800000	I think my trust comes mainly from the time my dr. is willing to spend with me. She takes the time to talk and get to know me and what my life looks like. She integrates any options into what works in my situation. 
0.800000	I have had the same physician since I was very young and he has always taken my concerns seriously. I have never had any issues with him. He always addresses my concerns and has been proactive about addressing any health problems I may have. He is always patient in answering questions or concerns.
0.600000	idk
0.920000	I trust my Dr because he takes the time to explain things to me and answer any questions I may have.
0.800000	I generally had positive experiences with health care providers. I trust that these people took their education and their training seriously and that they value their job enough to make correct recommendations. I have yet to have any reason to distrust medical professiols.
0.800000	My primary care physician is very friendly and likable. She always makes sure that I feel comfortable and I understand all of my options.
0.800000	I have been with my primary care physician for five years now and she has always steered me in the right direction. I feel I have total trust in her and always listen to and follow what she says. 
0.240000	Most physicians are time constrained, they do not believe in altertive medicine nor ways to treat problems, they want to prescribe a pill and have you out the door so they can make more money by seeing more patients. 
1.000000	My Primary care physician is very thorough and can recognize the problem very quickly. I have seen her for anything from a serious illness to a fall and she has known what the problem was so soon as I explained to her how I feel and she saw the injury. She has always been correct in her diagnosis and has sent me to great specialists when the need arises.
0.800000	I trust my current doctor since he seems pretty honest. He is friendly and has told me that he's interested in my well-being directly at least once. He wants to hear what I have to say, and if I ask a question about something, he does his best to answer it to my satisfaction. I haven't experienced anything that makes me feel I should distrust him thus far, though I won't say I completely trust him 100%, since I know he's not infallible.
1.000000	I have been with my PCP for 10 years. I have always felt like I could tell her everything, like being a lesbian and an alcoholic.
0.880000	It took me a while to find my current doctor because I wanted someone who listens and seems to care about me. I completely trust my doctor because he is an excellent listener and cares very much about my well being, he takes his job extremely seriously and I can tell he does this because he truly does care for people.
0.960000	"Just saw my PA yesterday. Here's what I wrote in the survey sent by the hospital. ""Kandace has literally saved my life. I had an onset of PMDD and was suicidal. Her triage nurse, ncy, took my concerns seriously and got me in within 2 hours. I had untreated lifelong anxiety disorder and had been on five different benzos. Kandace put me on Zoloft and I had peace of mind for the first time in FIFTY years. I had debilitating sinus migraines and she put on Allegra and I haven't had one since. She diagnosed hypothyroidism when I came in bundled up for Antarctica. She has controlled my HBP. She diagnosed a Vitamin D3 deficiency confirmed by blood test. She is simply the best primary care provider I have ever had in my 66 years."""
0.440000	It's not a question of trust, but I know what's best for me. A doctor is an adviser, not the end-all be - all. I trust my docs, but as they say, I trust my mother, but I still cut the cards
0.720000	Sometimes the doctor will tell me what i need to do or take, instead of giving me options. I know that he isnt always right all the time, so that makes me question him.
0.640000	I feel like I trust physicians in general, however, if I was about to make a serious decision regarding my health, I would not hesitate to get a second opinion if I felt uncomfortable. 
0.720000	My primary care physician hasn't given me any reason to think he has ulterior motives. He has been pretty spot on every time I have seen him so I will continue to trust his judgement.
0.960000	I have had the same primary care doctor for quite a number of years and she has always taken the time with me to figure out any problems and treatments available. She helps me come to a decision with treatment plans, taking my day to day life into account. If she doesn't know an answer, she will tell me, and refer me to a specialist she trusts to help me.
0.800000	I trust my PCP because she always tells me the truth, even if it is not what i want to hear. She has never lead me wrong. She takes the time to listen and do a full assessment. 
0.720000	I don't know, I haven't been to a regular doctor for four years. I went to the gynecologist like two years ago, and that went pretty well. I've known that doctor since I was a little kid (~3-4 years old), so I do tend to trust her. I think that most doctors are probably pretty trustworthy, because they really have to work hard to become doctors in the first place, so they probably wouldn't be bad people after all of that hard work.
0.480000	I do not have complete trust in any doctor. You have to be your own advocate. Doctors struggle with the amount of time spent with patients versus the number of people that need to be seen each day. Any time I am given a medication or advice from a doctor, I do my own research before trusting it completely.
0.800000	Because I have been able to talk to him like a person - without it feeling like a judgment.
1.000000	If I didn't completely trust her, she wouldn't be my PCP.  Health care is too important to leave in the hands of someone I don't trust and/or cannot communicate with.
0.640000	I have only gone to my primary care physician for about a year now and hadn't had one before that for 20 years. So far he has given me no reason to distrust him and has been open to conversations about various problems. I don't have enough data to have a strong opinion on how trustworthy he is but I am assuming he is.
0.800000	My PCP always sits and listens to me and together we choose an appropriate course of action.  She explains anything I question.
0.800000	He has dedicated his life to helping people with their life. I don't believe he would lie to me. I believe he always has my best interests in mind and gives me the truth.
0.800000	I have only know my newest primary care physician for about 6 months. My past primary care physician was used for almost a decade. I believe a relationship with a doctor is important. I'm not saying that will not develop with my newest doctor, but at the time total trust is not present. 
1.000000	My doctor is a great doctor.  He tells you straight about medical information.  I have researched him and he does not participate in pharmaceutical company kickbacks.
0.560000	I have a rare disease. It took 4 years and several doctors before I filly got a diagnosis and effective treatment. Along the way, I had doctors who were well-meaning but unhelpful, doctors that accused me of lying, doctors that ignored me and forced me to go to a patient advocate to get them to follow through. I've learned that it isn't in my best interests to assume that any doctor can be completely trusted.
0.920000	I trust mines because I have not experience anything that went wrong as of yet.
0.800000	I generally trust doctors and trust their professiolism most of all. I think they have more insight and I don't feel like I have to challenge it or anything like that.
0.720000	She takes the time to listen to my concerns. She fully explains all test results to me and answers all my questions without hesitation.
0.480000	Doctors are fallible human beings, no different than you or I and they can, and do make mistakes.  What is in their best interest may not be in yours as well.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they seem trustworthy and have had more experience than me.
0.520000	I don't trust any doctors anymore. I have seen so many that are not involved in my care as I feel they should be. I like my doctor now but I don't trust him.
0.960000	I have known my doctor for years and he has always been good to me. I haven't ever had a reason to stop trusting him.
0.760000	My doctor usually gives me the news straight and goes over treatment plans.  I have seen my health improve in the last 2 years since going to this doctor so I trust future advise he gives me. 
0.320000	If I'm asked about symptoms, I can barely finish a sentence before he just blurts out some answer. After that he's very dismissive of questions. I might get a printout with s cursory explation of what's going on.
0.320000	I don't care for my primary car physician. I feel like I am just a number as she quickly would complete my visit and rarely answer questions. When I truly had a need she didn't have any advice for me and didn't offer to converse with her colleagues to find out.She also didn't listen to me and caused me several scares during my first pregncy. I haven't seen my PCP in 6 years because of it. 
0.720000	I feel like most doctors will try their best, but I have experience with some who have clearly not known what they are doing. So while I generally trust them, I am always skeptical.
0.840000	I trust a doctor to know more about what is wrong when it is an infection or severe injury. Mild injuries including soreness and stitches have had moderately incorrect diagnoses. 
0.360000	My doctor does not make me feel like they have my best interest fully at heart because the last time I went in for an ongoing, painful issue they ran tests and told me that they did not know what was wrong, that was it. No further follow up to figure out what the problem was. 
1.000000	I have had the same primary care doctor for over 10 years. She is very thorough and explains her reasoning for any medication that she prescribes. She listens and pays attention to what I have to say.
0.680000	He may not have the best bedside manner but he's always utd on all new and current medical information and I feel I get great care just too faced paced if that makes sense
0.680000	My dr has helped me with several things over the last couple if years. She has even let me try a couple of meds that i had wanted to. I seem to do well under her care.
0.800000	My PCP has been very open about her reasoning and thought processes and gone out of her way to set me up with the next steps for me to pursue. She listens to my concerns and thoughts as well.
0.560000	
0.640000	I generally trust my doctor. I have been with him for years and would not continue the relationship if I had doubts about his care. When it comes to my health I am somewhat cautious so I do not completely trust my doctor.
0.840000	My primary physician hasn't failed me yet. The other week I went in because I had an horrible cough and headache. He took a look into my ears and prescribed antibiotics, one week later I am feeling better.
0.680000	I trust my physician because I know he graduated from a really good medical school. He also is very kind and takes him time to explain everything so you can understand it.
0.680000	I would like to think that doctors have the patients best interest at heart. I would also think that they have seen many cases of certain illnesses and have  lots of experience in dealing with the problem. However, sometimes, I think that a doctor can have ulterior motives but most likely not.
1.000000	I have been seeing my current doctor for nearly 2 years, but my experience with doctors in general is very consistent. Every time I have a question about my overall health or a specific condition, my doctor is able to clearly explain his thoughts on the matter. 
0.920000	My doctor does not dance around subjects and outright tells me what is wrong and how or why I should fix things if they need medical attention. 
0.640000	I have a new doctor and he seems fine. So far he persoble and seems knowledgeable. I hope over time he will be a good choice.
0.840000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for years now, and he is very familiar with me and my history. He has never steered me wrong, and he listens attentively to any questions I have. I have a great deal of trust in him.
0.600000	I believe that some doctors pay attention to you, but some do not. My current doctor i don't believe listens to me. When i first was going through menopause i felt like i was going crazy to have some much anxiety. He was a young doctor and i felt like he was looking at me like i just wanted drugs. He never explained to me all that goes along with menopause.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he is always blunt and honest. If I'm doing something to cause the issue he will tell me, and he gives me realistic ideas of the end results or recovery time. 
0.640000	My doctor is usually very good at explaining the mechanisms behind any diagnosis she give. But, when I got bloodwork done she completely overlooked something that has been shown to give symptoms that I was having. She immediately prescribed medication rather than trying to find out what the cause of my abnormal bloodwork was.
0.800000	I have total trust in my physician,  If I didn't, I would find another one in which I did trust.  I have never felt misled or lied to,  I feel as though they are looking out for my health, and helping me stay healthy. 
0.720000	"My GP has been great over the years. Rarely has he said ""trust me I'm a doctor"" He has a fantastic group of referral physicians and surgeons and has never steered me wrong with any medical treatment or diagnosis, unless there is little known about it then we both work on it"
0.960000	My PCP is a former Director of the CDC and is a Board Member of the American Cancer Society.  His experience, knowledge and wisdom, associated with viral infections and Cancer, have proven to be a profound blessing.  Also, his associates and other specialists work well as a team when preparing my treatment plans, explaining all of the parameters associated with them, and carrying them out.
0.800000	I've been with my doctor for almost a decade and she know my body inside and out! I trust her judgment because, so far, she's been correct about any issues I've had regarding my care. She is well educated and stays abreast of the latest advances in medicine, which she shares with her patients. 
0.720000	They have more medical training than me. I do not know anything regarding the field of medicine and that is their job. I have to depend on what they know, similar to how people depend on me for IT advise.
0.800000	i have had the same doctor for 10 years and know him and his decision making abilities and he has a good persoble quality and is fairly accurate
0.600000	As I only see a doctor once every few years, I would say I have had no reason to mistrust any of them.  In general, I feel I have been given adequate information and care.
0.600000	I haven't been seeing them long and when I do it's short. I get basic stuff answered. It still feels like business. Generally I trust them, because when I do ask questions about risks and side effects, it sounds like they're being honest.
0.280000	I will never trust anything in this medical system ever again. It is as simple as that.
0.520000	I have always felt rushed and just another number when going to the doctor. I have also been shamed by a few doctors for carrying some extra weight. Overweight people know they are heavy and need kind and conpassiote care, not being lectured to. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me about everything and explains things in terms that I can understand. 
0.560000	Sometimes I think she doesn't listen to all my concerns or tries to easily explain away or dismiss my concerns.  I would like for her to try to resolve each issue and not blow me off.
0.680000	Sometimes they don't listen to everything I need to tell them, and they come to a conclusion/diagnosis before I tell them everything I'm experiencing. Sometimes I'm left with some concerns. However, I generally trust their judgment.
1.000000	My primary care physician is always patient with me and does not seem rushed. He is very clear in his explations of his diagnosis and how to move forward no matter the issue. He is able to provide trustworthy and good recommendations in my experience. 
0.480000	My doctor is the same doctor I had as a kid.  He is super Christian and super American.  I haven't been to see him in over 10 years because he always wants to talk to me about Jesus and democracy.
0.800000	Docs are only human, by definition they are not perfect.
0.840000	My primary care physician actually listens to me, takes the time to hear and understand my concerns, and is willing to explore alterte treatment options er provide referrals to other specialists if we agree there may be some benefit.
0.440000	Almost all drs in this country have to follow the deranged findings of the government and the funding of the drug companies. 
0.840000	My primary care physician is my uncle, so I've known him my entire life and certainly do not think he'd put any concerns above my health. Also because he's a family member I've had lots of people approach me who are patients of his to tell me how much they trust him as well. As a doctor, he's both extremely careful and reassuring, and very experienced.
0.800000	in order to feel comfortable and know you have the right doctor for you is to be able to completly trust him and the desicions he makes.
1.000000	My doctor is very open and honest with me. He never rushed me, answers all of my questions. He goes above and beyond by calling and checking on me. He is very genuine in his treatment.
0.640000	Physicians are people and they make mistakes. They can be persuaded with money and gifts to be biased towards certain treatments. They can have fincial interests that bias them towards treatments, too.
0.640000	They have good intentions and want to help. They also have rules and regulations they have to comply with and don't have the time to get into the details about individual patient care. I trust that they are giving good advice, but it's only part of the picture. As an adult I need to research any conditions I have and find the best overall plan to treat it, including their treatment recommendations or medicines. 
0.760000	My primary care physician is very forward with information and makes sure I understand everything he tells me. He is very open to questions and is very considerate.
0.880000	My doctor seems to be honest and trustworthy. She has given me good medical advice in the past and I can't see a situation, unless something changes drastically, where I wouldn't trust her. 
0.560000	I believe doctors in general want money. I think they make stuff up to scare you.
0.520000	In my experience, doctors tend care less about their patients if their patients have free health care. When I did, the doctor I had kept trying to convince me to get as few tests done as possible, and never told me the results of those tests. Whereas if I had been paying out of pocket or had really good insurance, they probably would have given me every test in the book whether I asked for it or not. They have also been far too dismissive. When I go to a doctor, I want to know if a problem is real or in my head. If the doctor says there's nothing physically wrong with me, then that gives me a way to understand what's going on with me. But a doctor that refuses to help is a pointless doctor to spend your time and money on.
0.720000	"I do trust my doctor because he ""knows"" my family. He's been through a lot with us and we can talk about it all. That is nice to have someone that is easy going enough to be able to open up. It used to be called a good ""bedside manner"""
0.760000	Just his general presence and how he is willing to explain everything in detail and will allow extra time in appointments to go over any concerns I may have.
0.600000	I trust them nbecasue they are professiols. I am going there because I value their opinions and trust them whole heartedly.
0.640000	I believe that for the most part physicians have their patients' best interests in mind. However, because of the economics of healthcare in this country a patient's interests might not always be met.
0.680000	There's just really no way to know how much one can trust one's doctor. Sometimes the doctor may make an honest mistake--how much do you trust the doctor then? Does it depend on the consequences of that mistake?
0.880000	I have been seeing the same doctor since I was a young adult, he's always been kind, and comes of caring and astute. My doctor has never given me a reason to question his decisions. 
0.440000	Because i have family in the medical industry i have seen how cold they have become from being a caretaker. they get burned out and tired and start treating like a regular job versus a healing profession. 
0.800000	my doctor hasn't given me any reason to doubt his thoroughness, especially since i follow up his treatment with my own research on other treatments and medicines.
0.800000	She listens to my concerns and offers options. I have learned that I need to write down my symptoms over time and let her know what I've been feeling and for how long. She is then quite willing to listen and explore options
0.440000	I believe after being in a practice for a long time, everything is routine. I don't feel like they give as much thought into my complaints as they should. I don't go into the doctor for any old little thing, if I go, I am severely concerned. Their concern never matches my concern.
0.440000	When I delivered my baby it was near dinner time at the close of the business day and the doctor wanted to be done. He was frustrated that I had a birth plan that I asked him to follow when there was no medical indication not to and he injured me by speeding up the delivery in yanking out my baby. Following that there have been instances where I have sought help for a condition I have and the doctor has only told me he doesn't want me to continue the treatment I have been using without an explation as to why and he was pushing me to use a contraceptive rather than the altertive treatment that has been effectively working. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because they are medical professiols. Since I am not knowledgeable in the field it is in my best interest not to doubt my doctor unless proven otherwise. I not denying that there aren't incompetent doctors out there, but I will give them the benefit of doubt unless evidence contradicts.
0.600000	I haven't been seeing my PCP for that long.  For a long time I didn't have one, and this Dr. was one that was accepting new patients.  I find her manner rather brusque and hurried, I actually need to make her stop and answer questions.  I get a lot of my information from the nurses, but i want to hear it from the Dr.  She seems to always be thinking about her next patient instead of me.  I feel like I don't hold her attention for even the five minutes she spends with me.  For that reason, I will be looking for another PCP, it's just hard to find one that will accept new patients.
1.000000	My doctor is the first one to listen to me when I told him my antidepressants were making my feet and legs stay swollen and also it was causing me to shake a lot when I got hungry.  He took me off the immediately and then gave me the option of trying to survive without them or going on another type.  We worked together to get me off of both of them.  He also listened to my issue about sleep apnea and got me tested and approved for a corrective surgery.
0.600000	I have felt rushed in the examition room, even though my doctor was kind. I was also prescribed something and told it wouldn't affect my mood at all. In fact it made me extremely anxious, and the research I did on my own, after the fact, cautioned that it would.
0.400000	While i trust that doctors are often doing their best and have reasons for why the do or do not recommend certain treatments, I do think they fall into patterns and often disregard complimentary medicines. They can be quick to prescribe medication or surgery with holistic remedies or simple dietary changes can help. Doctors are people and they are flawed and I believe that just like many other people, provide better care to patients they feel connected with. I feel like i have a responsibility as a patient to do my own research and ask questions. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I have yet to receive bad advice from them. They have also been a doctor for a long time, so they have valuable experience that help my trust
0.760000	He's nice and doesn't belittle my complaints.
0.760000	He's been my doctor since I was a teeger. He is pretty blunt about telling you what is going and why. He is pretty thorough in his questions too. But if you smoke or anything, he'll tell you to expect a stroke.
0.520000	My primary care physician did not build a good rapport with me. I felt like, if I had to bring my child to an appointment, she cared more about holding my baby than caring for me
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have gone to their practice since I was a newborn and have had no problems, and have handled all of my vaccines and health issues appropriately with them. I figure that my doctor knows a lot more about health than I do and that alone is a reason to invest a lot of trust in them.
0.320000	"My PCP is worthless. i have been going there for 5 years, sick as a dog, and he keeps telling me I am ""healthy as a horse"" on paper. Just great.  I am in the process of finding another doctor before i croak."
0.800000	I completely trust my physician.It is important for me to stay healthy for myself and for my family.My physician is a very good person.She is very caring and understanding. She really makes me comfortable.
0.840000	My doctor tells me like it is. She's honest and thorough with me. She tries to relate to me. And speaks to me in a way I would understand.
0.800000	I DO TRUST MY NEW DOCTOR.  SHE IS RIGHT TO THE POINT ABOUT THINGS.  SHE TELLS YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND TELLS YOU HOW SHE FEELS WHEN YOU DON'T DO IT.  SHE HOLDS NOTHING BACK.  SHE HASN'T LET ME DOWN AS OF YET.  
0.800000	If I didn't trust my PCP then I would look elsewhere (as I have done in the past). One of the most important aspects of a PCP is trust. If I can't trust him/her then the relationship is worthless to me.
0.840000	My doctor has always had my trust and has not failed me yet. So I have no reason not to trust him.
0.720000	I feel that with my interactions with my primary care physician he shows a good amount of concern for my well being. I trust him because he gives me all the information I need to make a decision and gives me his opinions and experience to help me.
0.600000	"I have not seen this primary care physician that long and feel that they aren't as familiar with my background as they could be. I have also been denied certain medications that I feel I need just because they ""are not comfortable"" with prescribing them. I would have to go to a different doctor just for that then. I miss my ""old familiar with me"" doctor as well."
0.800000	I don't see my primary care doctor very often, but I do see my gastroenterologist on a regular basis. I trust him because I've been seeing for three years. In that time, I've been hospitalized when I was very ill and he made the right medical decisions for me. He's always informative when I see him and explains things well. I have never had any problems during any interaction with him.
1.000000	I trust that my doctor knows what is best for me. If he tells me something I have a disagreement on, I question his logic. I know my body pretty well and he knows that I give him all the information he needs to make a decision about treatment. I don't hold back and he doesn't either. 
0.800000	She takes the time to really understand what is happening and asks thoughtful questions to provide better health treatment without making you feel guilty about how you responded to her. She makes thoughtful suggestions without coming off as pushy or judgemental.
0.600000	Looking for another doctor in the city
0.760000	
0.720000	It's not that I don't trust them it's they always seem to have altertive agendas then what you feel you need. You go in for one thing and they test you for eight other things, they find out what's wrong and then they experiment with different medicines. 
0.880000	I have known my doctor since my first daughter was born over 13 years ago.  She has treated all of my children.  I started seeing her myself 4 years ago and she has always given me insightful options and thorough testing.
0.320000	Every single person in my family has trusted their doctor and ended up worse off for it. That is, except for surgeons. I never really have a need to go to a doctor, but I've been to a few dentists, one of which was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Filling fell out within days and their work was extremely sub-par. I had to go to a different dentist to get it fixed which cost me quite a bit. I've been with my significant other when she has went to her doctor and they literally googled symptoms. Yeah, I don't have a lot of faith in GP's. 
0.840000	I trust my physician because I have a long history over many years. I have experience with situations where there were options and feel my physician always had my best interest at heart and offered me the truth.
0.680000	I have seen different doctors throughout my life for regular healthcare visits. These have typically been older physicians. I trust their experience and judgement from having practiced medicine for many years. I haven't always agreed with everything they've mentioned but I believe they recommend what they do to the best of their abilities and due to trying to err on the side of caution.
0.400000	After years of having pain and getting sick, I am still no closer to knowing what is wrong with me that I was 6 years ago. I never seem to get answers to why I am sick, and even after tests the doctors still don't know. I am so frustrated by this. I don't have health insurance and have to go to a clinic and never get the same health care provider twice.  There is no one to trust in my case.
1.000000	She always goes above and beyond. She never stops trying until she finds whats wrong. 
0.880000	I have had the same doctor all of my life and rely on them to make sure I feel good in all situations.  I believe that normally all people are in this world to do good, especially doctors as I know they are there to look out for people.
0.800000	because my doctor will always give me choices and will always be honest with me. He will advise me on what to take and what not to take .
0.800000	I have been going to him for over 20 years.  He is frank with m.  he make sure I always no the score.  He does not beat around the bush, and I appreciate that.  
0.720000	I have always had good experiences with doctors. They have all been professiol and seemed to be competent.
0.880000	I trust them because it is their job.  I do realize that everyone has flaws and sometimes ulterior motives. However I still trust the doctor.
0.680000	I do not fully trust anyone completely, even a doctor. I always have a sense of questioning about what if. No one is perfect and even doctors make errors or are wrong.
0.760000	I generally trust my doctor.  If I had doubts, I would seek a second opinion. My doctor has many years experience and I am generally in excellent health.
0.760000	He has studied medicine a lot more then I have, but the things I have researched have aligned with what he has told me.
0.280000	I feel like my doctor does what is easiest when it comes to my medical condition. I don't think my doctor cares much about my wellbeing. He is just doing a job that he may or may not even care about.
0.400000	A lot of doctors see too many patients to be very through with each patient, which I fault health insurance companies for the doctors needing to see so many patients. I was prescribed a medication that could interact with another medication I was taking. I took that medication for months, seeing the same doctors and using the same pharmacy. It wasn't until my regular doctor (pain magement) was on vacation, an older doctor recognized the risk and took me off of it. This greatly reduced my amount of trust in both doctors and pharmacists. My PCP was also aware of the medications but, did not recognize the interaction. 
0.560000	I feel my PCP sometimes rushes through appointments. Plus they are handcuffed by what my insurance allows them to do. 
0.760000	I like him and have used him for years. I trust him.
0.760000	i trust my doctor because she knows more than i do about human bodies. i can look things up and give her my symptoms, but at the end of the day she knows a lot more than i do about how things work. I trust her.
0.840000	I have been seeing him for years and he knows what best for me. We both do research on things to see what will work the best.
0.600000	they do not want to see you back again in a few weeks so they are inclined to give you better treatment. 
0.360000	I typically do not trust doctors. They seem to be rushed and not look at people's problems as a whole. I hate when doctors only want to look at one problem that you have and not look at your body as a whole.
0.840000	I never trust anyone completely, however I truly believe that most doctors are truthful and honest or the most part when talking to the clients
0.960000	My doctor always take the time to explain things to me.  My doctor never makes me feel rushed.
0.720000	I trust my doctor for the most part.  A doctor isn't always aware of all the side effects of a medication or its interactions with other medications.  Medicine is changing very quickly and it is hard to keep up with the latest developments.
0.560000	"I haven't had a primary care doctor for years because I'm poor and couldn't afford to go to doctors, but I did go to the emergency room a few years ago and that doctor totally ripped me off. I had a sty bleeding wound on my eyebrow. The doctor glued it back together, gave me 2 Tylenols, and a tetanus shot. All of that cost almost $2000. You can explain it to me a million ways but there's no way those actions cost $2000. It took the doctor 5 minutes and the bill said that the ""physician fee"" or whatever it was called was $800. They charged me $10 a piece for the 2 Tylenols. All some of these medical people care about is money. It may have once been a noble profession but now they're just as crassly capitalistic as any other big business in this country."
0.760000	My doctor is above the average but still I've had to correct him regarding important details of my medical history as I've had to to varying extents with many doctors.  I do find that he is patient and receptive, however.  I've definitely had worse but my doctor is not ideal for me.  I'm not certain that exists.
0.640000	I feel like the time spent with me is probably not enough to accurately diagnose and help. I think my doctor has good intentions, and is very knowledgeable, but probably too busy. 
0.880000	I answered this about my mother's main surgeon. He removed her colon, ovaries, uterus, gallbladder, appendix and spleen. We went through four surgeon consults before I found the one we have now. I kept going back to our PCP and getting additiol referrals until I found one I liked. The first four were complete nightmares.They had neither the time or inclition to answer my questions thoroughly and were arrogant. I refuse to accept sub par medical care. I think hospitalists should get with the program and understand that their patients are CONSUMERS and while they are selling a highly specialized product, they do not have a monopoly.
0.600000	I believe that doctors and general can easily get caught up in the formulaic behavior of routinely prescribing prescription for patients A, B, and C, so when the next patient comes along with a similar issue it is just a wag of their pen to get them out of their office and another person into the exam room and go on with their day. 
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because I usually have a lot of questions to ask them when I come in for visits. They take the time to answer those questions and break down the technical answers into something I can understand. They also have taken care of all the other members of my family as well for years. So a long bond with our physician created that trust over many years.
1.000000	After a visit I check everything he has told me.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because when I go in for a visit, she listens to me and usually has more than one option to try without immediately going to medicine. I feel like I am heard and she typically solves my problems without multiple visits of trial and error.
0.560000	I had a wonderful primary care doctor but he had since retired due to too much paper work involved in the practice. For the time being, I don't have a primary doctor. However, I come in contact with different doctors. Many are good, normal people. They do their best to treat patients with their specialized knowledge that they spent years to acquire. At the same time, they are just humans and could only do so much to treat patients. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor, she asks good questions and always seems to take the time necessary to understand my needs. She doesn't seem in a hurry like other doctors I've seen in the past. 
0.720000	I trust them but not one hundred percent. The reason its not 100 percent is due to the fact that I feel they are in bed with big pharma. They are always trying to get you to take some sort of pill. Thats why I dont trust them completely. They at times seem to have ulterior motives with these pills. They wont hurt you, just push them like dealers. 
0.200000	"The dummy put me on birth control for headaches and then when I spiraled into panic attacks and depression, then came the zoloft and birth control. I knew there ""had"" to be some other answer because this all just came on so suddenly. They want to give you the typical ""disease"" bullshit and that you'll be on meds the rest of your life to mage. F no. I spent days and asked the universe several times to lead me to the answer, and it did. My diet was high protein, high fat, high processed vegan junk food, and ever since switching to a high fruit, mostly raw vegan lifestyle, I becoming a new person, and don't need their bullshit meds. They get handouts for prescribing meds to people and they don't fully understand the lymphatic system, in fact they completely ignore it. Unless Dr. Morse on youtube who was the ONLY one, that actually completely explained the lymphatic system, how all diseases are connected and the underlying problem of too much acid chemistry in our bodies."
0.960000	They spent years learning their practice so I should be able to trust them.
0.800000	I trust my physician because she is caring and honest. She is open and you can talk to her about any of your health concern and she will give her honest advice on what should or shouldn't be done. 
0.880000	I trust doctors to know what's best for patients because they have the required knowledge and training to diagnose these problems and provide accurate information to help solve issues.
0.520000	I don't completely trust my pcp. It often seems that if they don't properly diagnose a condition the first time, that they want to blame the patient instead of looking further to figure out exactly what the problem is. I feel like a lot of the time, they can't be bothered to listen, because in their minds, they've already decided what the truth is. 
0.520000	Sometimes doctors don't have the patients best interest in mind.
1.000000	I do trust my doctor.  He is very kind and thoughtful.  If I do not want to have an x-ray done, he does not force me to have it done.  He always asks me how I am feeling and if I have any questions and concerns that he can help me with.
0.760000	I trust my primary care provider a great deal.  He has done quite a bit to inform me of low cost options for treatment as well as flat out given me prescriptions.  He is also a big believer in preventative medicine.  The guy is a gem. 
0.440000	Doctors usually just want to peddle bullcrap expensive medicines that are just overhyped painkillers most of the time. $200 for painkillers is not justified, obviously there's some third party putting pressure on doctors to peddle this crap.
0.840000	I have complete in my doctor, Ihave been seeing her for quite sometime, She always give the best treatment , So for she have taken good care of me.
0.560000	I generally think he is honest and trying hard but I don't think he is a very good communicator and sometimes it feels like he is hard to read. I don't always know how urgent or serious something is.
0.640000	The practice I go to has SO MANY PATIENTS. The care is generally good, but I often feeling like I'm on an assembly line and their time with me is on the clock, so they might be more expedient than thorough.  
0.760000	I trust my doc becasue he talks to me like a person, not just throw meds at me and call next patient.
0.640000	I have been several times to my doctor and have mentioned certain pains or issues and if it is not the focus of the visit they are kinda brushed off.  This has happened several times so I don't completely trust my physician.
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because I have no choice but to, and most of the time i think doctors are usually here to help us so why would they not want to do what is right for their patients.
0.520000	I have no primary care physician now. Dealing with doctors in the past is the main reason I don't bother with them. I found them to rarely be good listeners. They are too concerned with covering their own ass these days than actually taking care of people.
0.760000	 Trust my primary care physician because not only did he go to school to be in his profession but he also has taken the time to get to know me.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because the things that he has suggested to me regarding my health have always helped me. My doctor is patient and listens to me when I have questions.
1.000000	I trust my PCP completely as he is the one who has the credentials, knowledege and experience to give advice and treat patients, including myself.I believe my doctor is honest and  I trust his decisions completely based on his thoroughness and willingness to answer and address any questions I have.
0.720000	I trust her for the most part. Any distrust I have stems from the fact that shes human and can make mistakes just like the rest of us. 
0.840000	She listens and responds.  She is warm and friendly and seems very interested in what I have to say.  She explains things in ways that are easily understood without being condescending. She treats me like a person.  
0.800000	They listen and are observant. They care.
0.840000	My primary care physician is direct to the point, and makes sure you understand what is going on.
0.880000	I completely trust my doctor to give me correct, accurate and complete information and not mislead me.  But I don't fully trust that my doctor knows which medical treatments are best for me.  I take the information they give me and I do my own research and I make my own decisions taking into consideration what my doctor has told me.  I am neutral that my doctor knows what's best for me.  
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he is compassiote about helping others and takes the time to answer any question I might have. I've always received prompt service and have never had to wait too long to be seen on in an office visit. He also has been willing to work with me if my insurance has not covered the full price of a medicine I needed.
0.560000	I feel my doctor doesn't really listen to me or take my concerns into consideration. He glosses over everything and will focus on something that isn't a true problem. I also feel he likes to give me every test in the world even if it doesn't pertain to any of my complaints. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I feel he genuinely wants to help. Whenever I seek him, he would give me all sorts of reasoble suggestions to help improve my health, responds to email, etc.
1.000000	I trust my doctor will always do whats in my best interests.  They have the expertise that I lack.  I trust that they have seen similar cases and can react accordingly.
0.480000	I believe doctors are mostly concerned with selling drugs to patients. Their main concern is treating symptoms, not the actual disease. Sometimes they spend just a few minutes with each patient, people get more attention at the mechanic .
0.200000	Every time I go to the doctor they seem to be in a bad mood. I don't quite know but their face is always that of a person when they are angry and do not want to be bothered. This leads me to not ask any questions about how I feel health-wise. I end up leaving without getting the input I need most of the time.
0.280000	The physician and doctors in general come across as rushed and that they have no desire or time to truly help.
0.760000	I've been going to my doctor for over 20 years.  He knows my history and persolity.  I can talk honestly with him and he'll have an engaging conversation.
0.760000	He seems sincerely interested in what is best for me.  He also sees others in my family and they feel the same way.  It is a feeling I have that he is trustworthy.  He has not given me any reason not to trust him.  I feel he is there to help.
0.760000	I have had my doctor for a long time and she knows my history well. She also knows I prefer tural treatments and to monitor things instead of masking with pills etc. Because we have established a good rapport I do trust her when I need to make decisions about my health.
0.800000	My doctor takes extra time to look for different altertives for me. She also always finds different ways to explain things to make sure I fully understand.
0.440000	It seems to me that more and more doctors are spread too thin in their practice having to see a maximum number of patients in as little time as possible, creating a less thorough exam or alysis of symptoms/ testing.
0.840000	I trust my doctor in that he has answered all my questions and has been right about everything I have asked, especially in regards to my own research about issues or topics I bring up to him.  The is a little distrust which is by my own doing in that I don't feel I can trust someone 100% without multiple opinions should something serious happen to my health.
0.720000	I spent time finding my primary care,  he's someone that is not overly difficult to talk to and has helped me with issues I previously was uncomfortable with other doctors.  He always gives me many options for medication with the materials to study them. 
0.800000	I do trust my doctor for the most part.  I know that not a lot of doctors study nutrition or altertive forms of medicine so I also study on that to and make my own decisions.  My doctor is very thorough and seems to care about me.  I feel comfortable talking to her.
0.960000	I have been his patient for several years.  My entire family is a patient AND there have been instances where i have requested weight loss drugs and he has refused to prescribe to me as they had adverse effects.  I trust him and his judgement completely and really do believe that for him, patients come first.
0.680000	I never trust a doctor 100%. I JUST got a new doctor, and I was happy with him when I went to have a physical back in November.  I like his temperament, his openness to listen, he followed up when he promised that he would, his staff was friendly and so was he.  He looks at things from multiple views.
0.800000	My doctor seems very competent and knowledgeable. She makes sure to listen to my concerns before discussing treatments. If I have questions about the situation, she answers them thoroughly. She has many years of experience and seems to know what she is talking about.
0.720000	I trust my doctor with my health or else I wouldn't go to my physician. I am a person who once I find a trustworthy doctor, I will stay with them until I need to change physician or I am not able to.
0.560000	"I would never trust a doctor 100%.  Even if they're trying their best, they don't always know what's right.  If you have something rare wrong with you, it will usually take multiple doctors before you find one that gets it right.  Most doctors will treat you under the assumption that you have the ""most common thing"" wrong with you that has your particular set of symptoms."
0.800000	My primary care physician is a human being. He sometimes has some mistake but I trust him
0.760000	I trust my doctors advice on care because I am a relatively healthy male with no preexisting conditions.  I only usually go see the doctor when I am really sick.
0.600000	I stay in the middle when it comes to trust.  I trust their opinion, but they are still motivated by self interests first.
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been seeing him for over 15 years and every time I go there it is consistent.  I have no reason not to trust him.  I cannot speak for everybody else though, because I believe some doctors could be corrupt. 
0.400000	Doctors are sometimes just out to make money. They know people generally trust them blindly, and they are just giving an opinion, so they can tell you whatever they want. I don't think all doctors are like this, but some are and it's hard to know which ones are trustworthy. 
0.800000	She never seems rushed with me, and she will always take the time to research an issue to make sure she's considered every possible solution. There was a time when I felt her treatment recommendation was too drastic, but she had no problem referring me to a specialist.
0.800000	We are very direct with each other. He doesn't  beat around the bush and makes suggestions and recommendations. I make the decisions, with his input. He doesn't always agree, but hey, I pay him, he don't pay me. He is not my boss. 
0.920000	I have had a good relationship with him in the past. I feel like he would tell me the truth about any potential diagnosis. He has given me reason to believe that he would not falsely lead me on with some diagnosis or other.
0.800000	I generally trust doctors and I never asked for a second medical opinion (unless I noticed that they had a bad attitude towards me and towards other people in general).
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she feels that if I am able to get healthy without prescription drugs, that is the best route. That is respectable to me since most doctors just want to push pills.
0.480000	"I feel that a lot of Doctors "" Herd Sheep"" because we don't have enough Doctors out there."
0.600000	My physician is reserved.  I do not feel totally comfortable with him.  He is nice but not very talkative.  He is a general doctor, so I am not sure that he is up on everything that is specialized.
0.800000	My primary care physician has my best interests and health in mind. He has always chosen the best options for the sicknesses that I had and brought me back to good health. I trust in his opinion and his explations of the issues that I deal with.
1.000000	I believe they know what they are talking about. They take time to tell me things. They let me ask questions.
0.400000	I have seen many relatives have horrible doctors who could really care less about their well being. It was like the only good they were was for the diagnosis. I have had a few like that as well. 
0.600000	Physicians are so busy I feel like they do not always take the time to fully listen and give all options. I trust that they would not put me in harm but I don't trust that I'm always given all available options. They are also highly restricted by insurance companies drug coverage etc.
0.240000	"The doctor I was seeing was not good at discussing things of importance with me.  Apparently he had too many patients because he left to go be an ""Amway"" doc.  I lost faith in him when I was literally dying and too stupid to realize it one time.  My throat was infected and slowing closing off my air.  I called for an appt on a Monday knowing he was in the office to do paperwork.  Would he see me?  No, he wouldn't.  I didn't think he would because for some reason Monday's are sacred to him.  I saw a perfectly competent doctor who referred me to someone else, a specialist.  But I never saw my doctor and I've always resented that a bit.  I literally was very ill and he could have at least popped his head into the door.  I lost a lot of faith in him after that."
0.800000	I have not trusted all physicians completely, but my current one has been a gem. He's been completely kind, compassiote, gives multiple options and educates me on what he's telling me (whether I ask for further explation or not) and spends time with me instead of rushing. When I had blood work done, he called me persolly to discuss my results even though they weren't all that remarkable and gave me further thoughts on how best to approach my health.
0.360000	I haven't been to a doctor in over a decade. In general I don't trust doctors. Many of them are so profit driven. I hope to never have to see a doctor again.
0.560000	The least that doctors can do is provide guidelines.
0.880000	I trust my PCP because she takes her time when evaluating my symptoms or concerns and doesn't try to rush through the evaluation as fast as she can.  She also reminds me of routine tests that I forget to schedule.
0.840000	I trust my physician because they always give me the best treatment options. I can always trust my primary care physician to select the right treatment for me. More importantly, I can trust my physician not to do the wrong things.
0.800000	"I've always had a good experience with my primary care physician. I can understand why some people might have had a bad experience with their persol doctors, but that doesn't mean their experience is the only experience anyone has ever had with doctors - my experience with doctors has certainly been positive. I'm certainly not desperate enough to rely on those ""THINGS DOCTORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" ads, anyways."
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician in general because I am intelligent enough to be able to tell if what they are saying makes sense. I always choose doctors carefully after much research and review and persol recommendations.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he is a human being and doesn't want to see me suffer; he wants to help.  I do believe that he will give me different options that will make the most money for him though.  As long as it helps me, I don't really care.  There may be some options he won't mention due to the fact that it requires me to go to someone else, thereby not giving him the money.  I do believe medicine is based on money, sad but true.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he cares about my diet. He also encourages me to exercise regularly. He is less likely to prescribe me medicines that I don't need.
0.400000	"She is young and doesn't really seem to have confidence in things.  I'll tell her my ailments and symptoms, but nothing really comes of it.  She'll prescribe some drug for depression or mood and have me come back in a month.  After a month, I always feel worse and she's just like ""huh""  Seems to me like it's more about getting you a prescription and out the door.  Get us in, prescribed, and out the door as soon as possible.  Who cares about your symptoms, the side effects of this new drug will make you forget about your old symptoms, because the side effects are worse. "
0.920000	My doctor has been a good doctor and I believe he does his job well.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because i've been going to him for years and years,  and after every checkup and everytime i've went to his office i've just got a good wholesome feeling from their practice. I just get the sense that he just wants what is best for me and my family.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has never given me a reason not to. He's always very thorough and he gives me options when appropriate. 
0.360000	I just havent had the best physicians. Ive been wrongly diagnosed in the past so there is little trust when it comes to doctors.
0.840000	The doctor I see most often is actually not my primary care doctor. I trust him because he listens to me. I feel like he understands what I'm saying. We make decisions together. It's not like he's telling me what I have to do. So I guess I feel like we collaborate. I'm the one who knows about me, and he's the one who knows about treatments. 
0.360000	Sometimes doctors prescribe you medication that you don't really need. They're also more likely to recommend a procedure that costs more. Doctors work to make money, I think there are few doctors who are ethical but most of the ones I've been to are not.
0.480000	I distrust my primary physician because when it comes to giving out medicine these doctors don't know exactly what is in it. So I feel like I should research the stuff my doctor said when I get home and then make a decision myself and talk to my doctor about it.
0.720000	I have used the same doctor for years.  He has always made sure I understand his recommendations/decisions.  I have never had an issue with his performance.
1.000000	As I mentioned earlier, I've had the same doctor for a long time. I almost consider him a friend at this point. He may be one way with other people but with me I knowhe's completely honest and cares about my health over his wallet or time.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because she has always treated me like a valued individual and explained things to me thoroughly. She is persoble and friendly but also knowledgeable and a fast talker. I really love my doctor.
0.800000	I trust only as far as one can trust. Certainly I would not go to a doctor if I read poor reviews about him. I dont believe in intuition however if I get a very bad feel for a doctor based on how he approaches my questions or converses with me then I will find another. The only way to really trust is to have it built over time and that is the best I can do. Its never good to trust anyone 100% but you can establish a good level of trust based on past experience
0.960000	My primary care physician demonstrates a willingness to listen to my physical and emotiol complaints and can empathize with me.  She demonstrates a level of caring for her patients that I have not seen often in a clinical environment.  She even remembers who I am and what I am dealing with without having to consult my records.
0.360000	"I had an experience with a doctor where he over prescribed pain medication.  I wrote an essay as a witness statement which was used in the case against the doctor by the India Attorney General.  When I was 16, I was hurting so bad and didn't know what to do so my parents took me to a pain magement clinic which would be described as a ""pill mill"".  I don't blame my parents at all.  The first thing I signed was a waiver for them to prescribe me opiates.  The first time he prescribed tramadol, ambien, vicodine, and a muscle relaxant.  He told me it would only be one month and then he would get me off all medication.  Months went by being told the same thing.  It took me 3 years to get off the medication.  I was a zombie.  Now all I need is medicil canbis, and no pills.  I feel better than ever.  This is why I don't trust any doctor and I don't  think I ever will."
0.400000	My PCP is always trying to push a medication that I don't necessarily need and always jumps to prescribing meds instead of looking for other solutions to a medical problem.  At times they also forget to physically examine me, just simply prescribing a medication.  There are drug information pamphlets all over the office and this puts doubt as to whether my PCP has a conflict of interest or not. 
0.600000	I trust my doctor for the most part, but at times I feel he rushes to get to the next patient. When I feel he is rushing, I usually wonder how thorough he has been in my case.
0.600000	I go to a nurse practitioner at a clinic.  I'm fairly happy with her but not completely.  I don't think they're that thorough and they've made a couple of mistakes in a fairly short time.  I'm considering changing to somewhere else.
0.800000	I generally trust my doctor's years of expertise and practice in the medical field. However, I also know that medicine is not a precise science and that there is still much that is not known about health conditions that afflict the human body. I know that there is always some chance that I may be misdiagnosed no matter how experienced my doctor is. However, overall I feel that my doctor has the wherewithal and the knowledge to give me the treatment that I require. My doctor shows compassion and concern when I visit her and has always answered my questions with clarity.
0.520000	My Doctor is very young and seems to always be in a massive hurry. I just don't feel like he has enough life experience yet to really be able to diagnose to his full potential.
0.560000	It feels sometimes like they are extremely overbooked, and maybe get kickbacks from the insurance company for making certain recommendations. It's hard to trust doctors.
0.440000	I do not trust my doctor. It's not that he is a bad guy, but he was taught in school to throw pills at most situations. I would rather take a holistic approach to my healing.
0.920000	In the past, my doctor has been very receptive to my needs as a patient. He has taken the time to explain to me anything I did not understand.
0.800000	I trust him because I can tell he cares and is thorough and not dismissive of me. I have previously seen doctors who I do not trust, and who dismiss my symptoms or concerns, so I know what the other end of the spectrum feels like. 
0.880000	I have never had bad experiences with my doctors in the past, so I have no reason to doubt them. most doctors care about their professiol reputation and will not be willing to jeopardize that.
0.960000	I trust my doctor completely to give me the best available options.  Having this doctor for many years has built a relationship of trust in him.  I would follow any of his orders without question.
0.800000	When someone goes to a Dr, it's a serious step.  They need to trust what the Dr has to say.  It's ok to ask questions and do independent research.  A Dr should be looked at as part of the team that helps to take care of you.  Ultimately, it resides within each of us to take persol responsibility.
0.680000	Having worked in the medical field for many years I can conclude that sometimes doctors push a certain treatment that may not be the best possible choice for the patient. I understand doctors work directly with pharmaceutical companies whose interest is making money.  
1.000000	I completely trust my primary care physician because he is extremely thorough. During appointments with him, he often exceeds the general '15-30min' exam time, but just because he's so informative. For example, the at my last appointment with him when we were discussing medication options, he was actually showing me published articles from the New England Jourl of Medicine so I can see the data for myself and be more informed in my decision. Obviously he's far more well versed in these things than I am, but he doesn't just assume that these things are 'beyond my comprehension'. He can explain things in a thorough yet not unnecessarily complicated way so I don't feel forced to just take whatever advice he gives me.
0.520000	"My doctor loves to golf and seems like that's his primary concern most times I'm there -- being able to get out of there early so he can hit the course. I call him a ""cough & cold doctor"". Basically he's good at that stuff, but for anything bigger I would prefer to see someone else (i.e. a specialist). I don't necessarily distrust him I just don't think he cares enough to dig deeper into things. He does what he has to to just barely get by."
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician based on 4 years experience with her. I receive my care through VA and I know she's always busy, but, hey, she even laughs at my jokes.
0.880000	I am uninsured and haven't seen a doctor for 14 months. When I do, I like my doctor very much. He is thoughtful and attentive, speaks in normal civilian language, not medical terms I can't understand. He takes all of the time I need.
0.800000	I trust physicians including mine. I do not think doctors are out to hurt us. I do not think it is likely to have a doctor make a horrible mistake so it is probably best for my health to trust in them. 
1.000000	I have known my Doctor for many years and I trust him.
0.800000	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, so I feel that he knows my background and my problems very well. I always feel I can ask questions if I don't understand something. I also find he is very willing to listen to my feelings about taking a medication and he seems to give them some weight in his decisions.
0.520000	I think has health care been decentralized and doctor are volunteer at places where health care are provided to those who needs it instead of running a business where hospital choose drugs based on relationship with companies and profit margin, and health care industries has become so large in the United States and it seems to be an ever self revolving perpetual growth by keeping the patient close to insurance and trip to hospitals, in other words, when health care is run as a business with insurance and pharmaceutical drug companies making profit, it is hard to discern whether physician's ethics or the paycheck determine the doctor's action.  And given the high health care cost of United States relative to other country when our health and quality of life is not correspondingly as high in ranking relative to spending, I think doctors, hospitals, are interdependent with insurance and pharmaceutical industries in term of making money.  it is kind of like asking someone whether they want to do something that would pay them double or do something that would reduce cost for patients while cutting their paycheck in half, what is the percentage of people do you think would choose the second option, considering doctors are also human
0.680000	I trust a doctor because they wouldnt have gotten here if they did not do well in medical school. 
0.800000	My doctor never makes me feel rushed. She always makes sure to answer my questions and make me feel involved in deciding my treatment. She makes it seem like we are a team and equals. She tells me about different types of treatments and recommends what will have less strain on my body. 
0.600000	I have had surgery in the past where the doctor told me there were two different options on the way he could perform the procedure.  I told him that I highly preferred the one method and didn't want the other at all.  He chose to do it the way I didn't want because it was easier for him.  Sometimes they don't tell you everything either, if they don't think you can handle it. 
0.800000	"I'm sure there are ""bad"" doctors but I have only had positive experiences. They have been attentive and seemed to genuinely care. I also trust their expertise."
0.520000	My primary care physician doesn't really seem interested in me as a person.
0.800000	I have been seeing my doctor for years and they always seem to be able to fix my problem and seem concerned about my well being.  I have trust that they will continue to fix and help my issues as they arise.
0.680000	I trust medical professiols except in the rare instances where I know more than they do. That's scarily common in mental health fields, especially.
0.880000	I really like my doctor and have been going to her for several years. However, there was one time when she misdiagnosed a problem I was having. Perhaps part of the problem was the way I described the situation. However, she put me on some medication which, after reading about it, I felt wasn't necessary at all. It turned out the problem was with my teeth and a dentist was the appropriate doctor to fix my problem.
0.680000	I trust my doctors advice. He would not take the chance of harming. I take his advice and do as he saya.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he has always been able to treat and cure any ailment that I present to him.  I always wonder if he (or any doctor) is sometimes motivated to recommend treatments that are fincially beneficial to him, however.  I don't believe my doctor has done that with me, but it is always in the back of my mind.
0.560000	I am moderately trusting of my physician, I'm confident there are some motives behind what she recommends that are not 100% in my best interest and I try to be mindful of that.
0.520000	"I have a hard time completely trusting him because sometimes it seems like he just doesn't really care. It seems like he's too willing to write off problems that I'm concerned about as ""probably nothing"". This has happened before with health issues that I ended up seeing other doctors/specialists for (even though he was very reluctant to refer me as he didn't think the issues were real/serious), only to have those specialists confirm that an actual treatable problem existed. He also misdiagnosed me once by saying I probably had bipolar disorder and sending me to a psychiatrist without doing any sort of physical exam or lab testing. I spent two years heavily medicated and miserable before a different doctor realized that the root of my problem was physical/hormol and started to treat me for it. And then all my mental symptoms went away. But he's one of the few doctors in my area who take my insurance, so I don't really have the option to have a different primary doctor. And he does know more than I do, obviously, since he went to medical school. It just seems like he's stretched way too thin and misses a lot of stuff."
0.960000	I am not currently in the care of a particular doctor, but all of my experiences, save one horrid anesthesiologist, have been excellent, which certainly says something because, as I said I have had a good handful of this and that over the years.  
0.800000	She listens well and I never seem rushed.  She is willing to answer questions and look up information if I ask something specific.  She is persoble and warm.
0.600000	I don't have a primary care physician. I trust doctors because they paid thousands and thousands of dollars to go to school and learn things about medicine that I don't know.
0.760000	I feel like I generally trust most doctors that I have dealt with because I usually do some good research or ask friends on doctors they have had experiences with before making a decision to visit them or not. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because he is the  one with the knowledge and experience when it comes to medical issues.
0.600000	Most of the time I do trust them.  I do think sometimes they are running on autopilot.
0.600000	I think it is more that I do not trust the time put into me as a patient than that I do not trust my physician.  I worry that my doctor has a busy schedule and because she works for a big company she is required to keep her time with me short.  I do not believe that it is possible to come to correct, well-thought conclusions when you only have 15 to gather information, process it, and explain to the patient.
0.880000	I trust my physician because she has known my family for a long time and I know she would never do anything to double cross us. She is very knowledgable and is always very in depth with her examition of me, which shows that she cares. She speaks to me like a person and makes me feel comfortable, instead of trying to just prove how smart she is like some doctors do.
0.800000	I have been seeing the same doctor for ten years and, while I haven't always taken his recommendations, I always know why he offers them. I have implicit trust in his judgement and he never fails to take my concerns into account. 
0.440000	I persolly have those feelings towards all physicians as well. I also lean more towards altertive medicine.
0.840000	I will only trust them if I have previously dealt with them. It takes a few visits for me to be able to trust in a doctor. I have encountered some that are only in it for the money and do not care about the patients.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. He's certainly smarter than me and I let him know what's going on. I feel like because I'm open and honest with him he's that way with me.
0.680000	I mainly trust doctors, but I don't doubt that some of them aren't completely honest. At the end of the day, they are getting a paycheck from sick people.
0.640000	I trust my doctor very much, I am just also the type of person who likes to do my own research before proceeding with any treatment plans. 
0.800000	i trust my doctor because she has always listened and been very helpful when i needed to discuss something. i needed to get my first mammogram last year and had been putting it off. when i saw my doctor she really encouraged me to go and get it done. she wasn't mean or stern. she was very concerned for my well being and wanted me to get the mammogram done to benefit my health. 
0.600000	I think doctors tend to rush and don't really go in depth to things to give you all the options. Typically they just give me whatever the most popular treatment is without listing options
1.000000	I have always followed her advice and listened to what she prescribes for me, and I never have an issue. She is smart and very observant. She cares about how she takes care of her patients and she also cares how my other doctors (specialists) are taking care of me.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I have no reason to believe that he is dishonest.   I also have not been misdiagnosed in any way.   The only negative is that he is sometimes very busy and does not spend a lot of time with the patient.  The office is also very quick to push people to specialists.
0.400000	I had a new PCP the last time I visited the doctor. I was not pleased with her performance. I am now awaiting an appointment with a new PCP.
0.480000	We have recently moved so I've had to find a new primary care physician and I am having a hard time trusting him.  I have been on several of the same medications for years and years, but a couple of them he is not comfortable with, so he is wanting to change them around even though I have been the most stable on these ones for the longest period of time.  I feel like he doesn't trust what I'm saying, and it doesn't make me feel good.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for many years. He has always been upfront with me and what my options were for that particular ailment.
0.960000	We went to the same high school. She was always a smart and sweet person. By knowing her background I trust her completely. She has always been good when I visit her at the doctor. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor mostly.  I say this because I have a hard time trusting any doctors all of the way.  I have seen many doctors and have had some pretty bad experiences (one telling me that it was all anxiety and then I filly found another doctor who believed me that something was wrong and found the right blood tests to run).  I think I trust them to some extent, but I also rely on what my gut is telling me.
0.480000	"I usually have to see a doctor at the E.R. because I have no insurance, so I tend to feel they obviously won't have anything ""persolly invested"" in me as an individual. I think sometimes they just do whatever gets me out of there the fastest, whatever treatment is easiest and quickest. I usually have to remind them to try to keep my lack of income in mind when writing prescriptions and such. This being said, if it is an issue that does not directly involve mental health or drug addiction (these are areas I am knowledgeable about because I have issues relating to these areas), i.e., if it is something I probably don't know much about, I generally trust the doctor because they obviously were smart enough to make it through medical school."
0.760000	I don't know. I just trust my doctor. I guess she hasn't given me a reason not to trust her.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I feel she's always done great with me as a patient. She's thorough, explains anything I don't understand very well, and is just extremely reliable all and all. I trust her because I've had great past experiences with her.
0.800000	My primary care physician is always monitoring my results from lab tests and amends my medications accordingly. She is thorough and likes to be one step ahead and is calling me instantly when she sees any information she finds troubling.
0.800000	My doctor is very knowledgeable. On my first visit I kind of tested him by asking a few difficult questions. His answers were beyond my expectations. I have no reservations about trusting him to make wise decisions.
1.000000	My physician is always very transparent with me. She always asks if I have any questions, and she always answers them so that I understand. She never seems in a hurry, and she is always very friendly.
0.800000	I haven't yet run into a doctor that wasn't looking out for my benefit or gave me bad advice. I've heard stories of bad doctors out there who look out for their benefit first, but I've thankfully never ran into one of those doctors myself. Heck, I had surgery a few years back that saved one of my testicles from dying. I think I had something called testicular torsion. Doctor saw what the problem was and gave me the right advice to getting it fixed.
1.000000	Our family has been going to the same doctor for 25 years, we trust him very much. He takes time and explains everything.
0.480000	I trust my PCP because she seems intelligent and seems to care about her patients. But I don't completely trust her since she is human and is very busy. She doesn't have time to be extremely thorough and careful.
0.600000	my doctor misdiagnosed my low sodium  
0.760000	I trust my doctor because all of the things I have gone in for over the past years have been small and mageable. My doctor is friendly and caring even under time constraints and has been candid but kind in regards to things like getting my weight down, etc. I trust that overall he has my best interest in mind. 
0.760000	I see an endocrinologist every 3 months. I trust him. He is young and seems to be very knowledgeable in my particular health issue. He is not afraid to try new medications to help me and talks in plain English rather than using unfamiliar medical terminology when talking to me. I trust him and he seems to take more time than most at each appt.
0.800000	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a long time. She always explains everything to me in clear, easy to understand way. She thoroughly explains all the options of treatment and suggests the best one for my needs.
0.400000	"I just feel that the doctors are just following what is on the screen or what the head of their department wants. For example in pregncy they do a ""diabetes blood screen"" at 6 months and they make you drink an aweful glucose gmo drink. Now it has come out there are lots and lots of different options of what to drink or even just doing diabetes testing for a few days/week but still the places go ahead and do it because ""protocol"" or like if you have a csection, they force you to a 2nd one or pay extra money to get one with only a few doctors with waiting lists. It's very stressful to have people just blindly following protocol instead of listening to what you need and want and working for you. "
0.720000	I have been one of the healthiest people ever, it seems; thus, I do not go to the doctor often. Since I don't need to go to the doctor all that often, it's hard to answer these questions. I do go for check-ups, but haven't gone every single year. I'm now 64 and am trying to go every year or two. But just going to the doctor for something so routine is not quite enough to thoroughly judge a physician's abilities.
0.520000	Sometimes I feel like he does not listen or believe I have certain symptoms and instead takes the easier diagnosis. 
0.520000	Follow up information is idequate.
0.840000	I had a stroke last year and the care my Doctor has provided has improved my health greatly.
0.280000	I have been pushed around and lied to in the past by doctors. Doctors do not spend enough time getting to know you or your situation before making a diagnosis and are often wrong. Doctors in general are greedy and care more about money than helping people. 
0.680000	She has shown me that she wants the best for me and my well being
0.920000	I trust my doctor.  He is always very open about all my options and is willing to help me.  He always treats me like family and sometimes even calls to check up on me.  I believe he really does have my best interest at heart. 
0.960000	I have been seeing this doctor for several years.  He is very professiol, approachable and friendly.  He also has very good reviews from other patients. 
0.760000	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to my needs and concerns. She takes the time to thoroughly explain my conditions and the medications I'm taking. She has a great bedside manner and is really nice.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has never steered me wrong. He's been great in answering my questions and is quite knowledgeable. He's very intelligent.
0.760000	I generally trust doctors as I only see doctors who I have done a lot of research about - to see that they are generally revered in the medical world. I believe if they are that successful and well known, I can trust them. However if it was an ER doctor, I'd be cynical. 
0.680000	I really like my doctor but I do find her rude at times and it is apparent when she is having a stressful day. Unfortutely a few months ago my summary of my doctors visit was given to another patient. The visit was incredibly persol and I was horrified. I have lost a fair amount of trust at the office since.
0.560000	I do feel that they are usually trained to give certain responses. I wish that doctors would take a more holistic approach and give nutritiol support options along with conventiol medicine, and give the patient the option to choose both. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor. However in the modern world, science is just one more are of Leftist rrative making. I am mindful when researching that doctors and scientists have an agenda which is certainly not truth. For example: Climate Science, Bill Nye, Neil Tyson, when people talk about settled science I laugh at their retardation and misunderstanding.
0.880000	I trust my physician because she is very caring, knowledgeable, and understanding. She works with what my medical plan covers and anything I pay out of pocket which takes a lot of stress off my mind. I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off and I'm getting the services required.
0.440000	I trust doctors to some extent to in most cases try to help. However I do feel they sometimes think of themselves or money they make from kickbacks 
0.520000	I have been given a new doctor recently who've only been to once.  Therefore, It is difficult to judge how much I can trust them.  The majority of the time spent is sitting with a nurse.
0.560000	Sometimes I feel my appointments with my primary care doctor are rushed. There have also been times when my doctor wasn't very informative on treatment options when I have been sick. Because of this I feel I have to do a lot of independent research when I am sick or am given a diagnosis. 
0.680000	Although I don't have a certain doctor that I go to, I trust most doctors in general. Of course, there are bad ones that don't do everything that they are supposed to, or that don't do their job as they are supposed to, but I do trust most doctors in general to do their jobs properly.
0.960000	I see a DO rather than an MD. I really like how current he is on  new issues in medicine. He also is knowledgeable on the body and prefers to prescribe stretches, and lifestyle changes than medication. I like that he is very thorough and really cares for our family.
0.520000	I don't have a primary care physician. Regarding doctors in general, I don't trust them because a lot of them don't seem to care about you as a person, they only look at you as an insurance claim or a cash cow they can keep milking by adding on more tests or prescribing drugs just to get the most money they can from your insurance company or medicaid/medicare.
0.600000	I feel like all they want to do is make the most money they can so they refer things for no reasons like procedures and medicine
0.760000	I trust my physicians because he is generally very thorough in our exchanges. He takes the  time to listen to my concerns and will provide me valid answers and options for my treatments.
1.000000	I've been going to my primary care physician since I was a teeger. I've had some medical issues that he's helped me to resolve over the years. He's had his practice for a long time and has never given me a reason to not trust him or his staff.
1.000000	I trust my physician or doctor because I feel safe with them. 
1.000000	My Dr is a 38 year old female and she's the best Dr I've ever gone to. She is friendly, caring very easy to talk to, has admitted to me that she didn't go into medicine for the money but wanted to help people. I have complete trust in her.
0.800000	I've seen him several times and he is always candid and straightforward with his opinion, reasons and concerns. I've never had a reason to second guess anything he has told me.
0.560000	I like to get a second, third, and sometimes fourth opinion on things. My primary care doctor isn't God and I don't entrust my health to her. Her services are valuable, however.
0.480000	Doctors don't really have enough time to deal with all the solutions that might benefit a patient, so I think the routinize things in a way that I don't trust entirely. For the most part, I do trust their recommendations are genuine and effective, though. 
0.760000	I have had more than one doctor.  The last one I have I get more information, but am not sure about advice.
0.720000	They have years of school and  experence  
1.000000	I've been coming to my doctor for a very long time. Over that time, there has been a lot of trust built and that's hard to come by. She always seems to be concerned about the stability of my health.
0.840000	I can't say that I fully trust my doctors. After all, they are getting paid for what they do. I do believe if it came down to the cost of treatments they would choose they one with the highest cost for me.
0.800000	My doctor has never steered me wrong before. Although he may have been quick with information i have always been able to find out what i need.
0.440000	"He is generally there to ""process"" people and get his numbers. If I ask for a prescription for a given issue, he is very willing to write it and move on. Has has some misdiagnoses."
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they are honest. If I didn't trust them I would get a doctor I do trust.  Trust in your doctor is very importan . 
0.800000	I don't have much experience interacting with my physician because I'm pretty healthy.
0.960000	My husband and I share the same Doctor and there was a time my husband had an appointment and I did not and I went with him. I had a cold at the time and even though it was not my appointment and I didn't bring it upâ the Doctor noticed and asked me questions. Right then and there he wrote a prescription for me even though I didn't have an appointment for myself. He has always gone above and beyond in the care of my husband as well (who has Type II diabetes) and has always been there for us when we had questions and needs. I would recommend him to anyone.
0.920000	My doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and follow up with appropriate treatments/testing.  This has not always been the case so I can definitely see the difference in what a good doctor and bad doctor are.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he has never done any harm to me and always has my best interest at heart. I have to trust that he knows what he is doing as I obviously don't have the training that he does. The only thing that does bother me about my doctor is that he is sometimes too busy for his own good and maybe doesn't take as much time as what he should with patients. I think that his office sometimes schedules too many patients in one day and that is what causes this mind set for me. 
0.840000	I believe that for the most part, doctors have their patient's best interests in mind. I think it is somewhat uncommon for doctors to be more concerned about what is best or more convenient for themselves.
0.680000	I have limited experience with my current primary care doctor but she seems to be pretty thorough and honest.
0.680000	It isn't so much that i distrust my Dr. the individual, but rather i distrust the system. The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM. 
0.680000	My doctor does not always tell me all options available. Sometimes this is due to his time constraints. In general I trust him and his opinions.
0.840000	i think my doctor is competent. i've been using his service for a long time
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has training and experience. I will question him if I have doubts, and do some of my own research, but I think my doctor is my best resource. 
0.800000	I've had the same doctor for a very long time and she's always put in the time to see me and help me feel better no matter what's wrong.
0.840000	i trust them because they are professiols
0.680000	I trust her.  I just want to look over anything she prescribes to me
0.760000	She just appears very genuine. I don't get the slightest hint of anything off about her. I've been seeing her for a few years now, and on more than one occasion, even when she's clearly running behind schedule, she shows no rush to be through with me. She feels like an ally.
0.720000	My primary care physician does a good job of looking at all the possible treatment options, and talking with me in detail about which option would work best for me.  I think it would be great if they incorporated a more holistic approach to my care and not just looking at the medication treatments.  
0.640000	My doctor tends to be really straightforward without sugarcoating anything. If I have something wrong with me, then he just says it and tells me how to treat it. 
0.840000	I have a lot of trust in my doctor because he is a close family friend, but I sometimes notice that some of the things he says are a little bit for his convenience.
0.760000	My primary care physician has been with me for a long time and understands my health best. He seems to genuinely care about his patients which makes it easy to give my trust. 
1.000000	I trust them because I've known them a while and they listen to me.
0.760000	"i just started seeing my new primary care this year. i have a reasoble amount of trust in her, though i believe most doctors are very traditiol in their methods and i like to know about ""outside the box"" treatments, such as holistic methods. i like to do my own research on the issues i face and often times doctors don't want to hear what ""dr. google"" has to say."
0.800000	I have never had any issues with any of the doctors I have seen.  They have all seemed to empathize with my issues and appeared to care about my well being.
0.520000	My doctor tends to rush my appointments. She is in and out in less than five minutes, and doesn't really seem to read any of the paperwork I fill out or really take much interest in the concerns I bring to the appointment. Last time, for example, I brought in concerns about my back pain, but she seemed more concerned about my borderline high blood pressue and gave my a referral to a cardiologist.   
0.680000	"I definitely trust doctors, but ""completely"" is an awfully strong word. Doctors have hundreds of different patients, so don't always have the time to get to know me and my conditions as well as is necessary. While I trust their medical knowledge generally, I am ultimately in charge of my own health. "
0.640000	I have been with my doctor for a number of years, and he has always been able to take care of my problems. I think I could better answer this question in regards to why I don't trust him. Sometimes, I read and learn about treatment options, but when I discuss them with the doctor, he generally doesn't give them any merit- I am not talking about radical treatment options which have no backing in the scientific community. However, as I think about this now, I realize that he ought to have my full trust, as he is lettered in medicine and has never done wrong by me. I am virtually experimenting when I offer my input for treatment options. I don't have as much certainty as he does- I could say that I am just trying to see if I could find a solution on my own, sort of like a test of my ego.
0.520000	 they see a lot more people today and do not develop the rapport they once had
0.440000	I am very open with my physician so I tend to trust him with most decisions, but it's my body and I want to have the fil say. I believe that all people are inherently selfish, and so I am scared that if I let my guard down, people will take advantage of me. I'm not a trusting person, so even if I agree with my doctor on a major issue, like surgery, I would still want to go to another doctor and get a second opinion, because my health is very important to me. 
0.400000	DOCTORS THESE DAYS ARE OFTEN NOT SUFFICIENTLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT. THEY DO NOT LISTEN OR HAVE AN INTEREST IN LISTENING TO PATIENTS. THEY HAVE 15 MINUTES TO SEE YOU. LESS IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. IF YOU TRY TO ASK A QUESTION THEY ARE IMPATIENT AND TELL YOU THEY DO NOT HAVE TIME. THEY HAVE A SUPERIOR AND JUDGEMENTAL ATTITUDE. THEY ARE OFTEN FLAT OUT RUDE. THEY ALSO BILL FOR THINGS THEY HAVE NOT DONE AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT REASOBLE.
0.720000	I have faith in my doctor and trust her very much. Sometimes I feel that she is a little rushed but all in all she is honest with me and talks with me making me feel at ease.
0.800000	I HAVE CHANGED DOCTORS RECENTLY. HOWEVER, THE PAST FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING HER ADVICE, I HAVE LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND FELT BETTER. ALSO, MY HUSBAND HAS LOST WEIGHT AND HIS DIABETES IS IMPROVING. SO FAR, I THINK I HAVE RECEIVED GOOD ADVICE.
0.760000	I believe my doctor has no reason to lie to me unless it happens to do with trying to sell me a pill of some sort. That does not work for me because I can't swallow pills, so the subject usually moves to altertives or something I can do myself, at home,  to help the problem. I think a doctor can tell who is serious in trying to get well and who just wants attention and/or a prescription of a magic pill to get them well. I am willing to do the work to get myself well, so I get along fine with any doctor I see.
0.520000	I trust them, but there are times when they rush things and I'm left wondering if they were caring about me at all.
0.440000	I have a general mistrust with doctors in general. I always hear of many problems and mistakes that doctors make and it make me suspicious when they tell me something. I have yet to experience this but hearing other people's story makes me feel like you can never be too careful. I like to get different opinions to make sure what he is telling me is correct.
0.920000	I trust my physician because when i have any doubt he is always there to help me and understand any difficulty that i am going through. H e tells me things more in a friendly way than in a doctor type of serious situation. I completely put all my trust in him and he has given me alot of reasons to trust him.
0.360000	Doctors don't always give the best advice and many times make the wrong diagnosis. People can fix issues on their own, such as reversing heart disease and such through diet but doctors refuse to accept that despite it being proven countless times. So for reasons such as that, I don't trust doctors in general to do what is best for someone. 
0.960000	Me and my wife have the same doctor now for 15 years.She is a wonderful caring and nice person.We trust her with everything.
0.680000	I guess I trust him because of familiarity. At first I didn't trust him 100% but after 15 visits or so I've come to rely on his advice since I've seen my health (asthma specifically) has gotten better. Although he's as stoic now as he was on my first visit. Hard man to read. 
0.840000	I have had the same PCP for about 5 years and she has never made me feel rushed and always asks thorough questions about the status of my health. When I have had any problems she made sure to order the appropriate testing.
0.720000	While I sometimes feel like I'm another patient being flown through the door, and husled along. My doctor usually is very thorough and will sit and discuss anything that I need to talk about.
0.800000	My doctor has always spent the time with me that I need to help me with any issues I have.   I am comfortable with my doctor and his ability to help me.
0.720000	because he is our family doctor... i know him from a very long time... i know his capacity as a doctor... he is very kind and highly knowledgeable... so i completely trust him...
0.840000	He has never given me a reason to not trust him, he always explains things in ways i can understand, and usually lets me choose my own options, though he will always let me know what he recommends and why.  He is also very understanding of my issue with when i go to him, i usually try to ask and talk about all my issues at once, which can make meetings last longer then they should.
0.480000	I have actually gone to my doctor self diagnosed, only to have him tell my I was wrong, but later realize I was correct. I've also caught him being dishonest by neglecting to tell about specific treatment options, and even explaining options incorrectly.
0.280000	I have a medical condition that has been ongoing for years. The last time I went to visit the doctor, I asked her about what procedures I should do for that issue. She said to me that she hadn't seen that in my chart, went and checked, and seemed surprised that I had that condition. I have been seeing her the whole time. Then when she gave me instructions about procedures and what I should do next, she also gave me the last set of test results from the past year, and there was some disturbing results that should have been followed up on at the time. Needless to say, we followed up on them then but it could have been catastrophic for me if the results turned negative, which thankfully they didn't.
0.960000	I trust my doctor as he spends all the time I need at every appointment answering questions and explaining all options, side effects and testing results.
0.800000	He seems to know what he is talking about so I trust him.
0.720000	My doctor is great.  He doesn't talk down to me because of my GAD and PTSD, and he listens to me.  He has absolutely no problem admitting that he doesn't know everything, and refers me to a specialist for things he feels are out of his field of knowledge.  He's also got common sense.
0.800000	Some doctors are not transparent and they just tell you things without giving you the opportunity to ask them questions and address your concerns. The doctor encourages me to ask questions and tries to clarify my concerns.
0.880000	I have done a lot of research on my current doctors and have taken the necessary steps to be sure that I am being seen by competent and caring individuals. I trust their opinion and knowledge with regards to my healthcare. When I am seen by them I feel welcome and encouraged to speak about my concerns rather than rushed and ignored. 
0.600000	My doctor is generally in a rush.  I only see him once a year for a check up so I guess that's good but then I have a year's worth of questions to ask.  I usually get one in and then he's off to the next patient.  He was effective at treating a friend of mine so I guess I should trust him on that basis but there's just not enough time.  
0.920000	He seems to know his stuff and has never disappointed me in the past. His attitude shows that he cares and really takes care of me.
0.680000	I don't get to go to the best Dr.s My insurance sends me to a clinic. The Haitian men Dr.'s there speak English as a second language. I do not trust them. 
0.480000	Doctors these days hardly spend any time dealing with you. They tend to rush in and out without taking much time to offer up explations or reasons for what they are doing. It seems that most often it is left up the the nurses or the PA to answer your questions because the doctor has to be doing other things. I also feel like they don't want to give you altertives or other possible options in fear of being sued.
1.000000	I have noticed that she's gone above and beyond when she didn't have to so that makes me very comfortable with her. She also actually listens to what I have to say too instead of brushing me off.
0.240000	My doctor is set in her old ways. She insists putting me on blood pressure medicine with a diuretic is excellent, but in reality it made me sick,lethargic,dehydrated, and I fainted constantly. In fact, it made my blood pressure too low. Now once again my doctor wants to put me back on the diuretic. She doesn't care what it did to me the last time. I tried to explain to her how it made me feel the last time but she doesn't seem to listen. Also, I have hypothyroidism. It took them 4 years before they took me off synthetic thyroid and put me on NDT thyroid. I had to put my foot down to filly get her to switch me. I'm doing a lot better now I'm on NDT thyroid.
0.240000	My primary care is a nurse practioner. I don't feel she has the qualifications to deal with the many serious issues I have. Her office is packed, the time with her is very short and she does not answer my most pressing questions.
0.560000	I don't distrust my doctor so much, I just know that he is a human being and doesn't have all of the information. My doctor has a family so when he leaves the office he is not doing research on new treatments or new information. I like my doctor I just think that he is a little out of date and doesn't take the time to educated himself on new medical practices or even new nutritiol information.
0.520000	I think Dr offices have become more of an assembly line, long waits and I just think sometimes they are so rushed patients do not get enough time to get all their questions answered and time to gather information about medications and treatment options in depth.
0.640000	My physician is okay, she seems scattered at times and has made mistakes in appointment times or reading records. But nothing that was critical was overlooked. She is convenient, a female, and although an MD believes in altertives.
0.480000	"I have little faith in the medical system as a whole simply based on what I have persolly experienced as a person with arthritis and chronic pain, and based on what people I know with other chronic conditions have experienced generally.  In the past, my condition has been ""written off"" as being caused by things I know it is not caused by (for example, the last time I went to a rheumatologist, I them I have had joint pain for most of my life, and their response was it is the insomnia I have only just recently been plagued with that is causing it when for 90% of my life I had a very healthy sleep schedule), thus preventing me from getting proper treatment and having to jump through hoops to ""disprove"" what I already know.  I generally feel doctors do not trust my own knowledge on my health, and therefore I am not totally trusting of them or their motivations.  "
0.960000	Trust but verify, using the popular vercular: Never buy a pig in a poke!
1.000000	I love my doctor,I recommend everyone to my doctor but it took 4 doctors before I found him,before I found him I hated doctors they did not listen or care what you say my doctor will sit and talk to me for 20 mins he is great and he does not push pills he believes in fixing your self or your diet,he is great.
0.760000	I've never been given a reason not to trust my PCP - Dentists on the other hand: don't trust them!
0.600000	I don't see my primary car physician that often, but when I do she always seems kind of rushed and mechanical. For that reason I don't completely trust that she's explored all of the options, or given me the knowledge I need to know what my options are, but what she does do for me I trust is effective and not harming me. 
0.720000	I have learned over the years to trust in doctor's opinions as they have never let me down in a serious way. Sometimes they tend to be hurried and most do not like to do a lot of chit chatting but the advice seems to be very good. They have the experience in these areas so I usually go with whatever they think.
0.800000	I trust my PHC because diagnosis and prescribed medicines have worked in the past.
0.760000	She listens to me. Also I have other family members that go to her and they have gotten wonderful care from her also
0.520000	The few doctors I had some don't seem to interested. They just ask for symptoms then just prescribe medicine. They feel like their disinterest. Just write a prescription and your done.
0.800000	I trust him. He always runs extra tests and checks on me clearly.
0.840000	I feel my doctor has no reason but to tell me the truth.  I feel they want the best for me.
0.640000	what if a doctor is trying to get you on a medication you dont need  i know most doctors help  people some are in it for the money
1.000000	I completely trust my primary care doctor because I have had the same doctor for over 15 years with no negative experiences or instances.
0.760000	My doctor seems to be generally caring and concerned for my well-being. This also seems to be true for her other patients. While I don't always feel like the priority, I do feel as though I am cared for in a proper manner.
0.560000	Through my husbands insurance (which I have no choice over) I just feel like this set seems not to care to much about the patients.  They seem not to want to listen to me.  For example: when my back was hurt and I could barely walk.  They did an x-ray but they did not see anything on it.  They acted like it was all in my head and that my pain was not real.  I could barely walk for over a month.  I lost trust in my doctors.
0.800000	My doctor has far more knowledge about medical conditions and treatments than I do. He seems to genuinely be interested in recommending the best solutions for my health needs. For these reasons I have to trust him.
0.640000	My health is more important to me than it is to him.  I have read the results of the 8 year study by Arizo University on chelation.  My physician who offers chelation has not read the results of the study.  Absolute trust would mean that a second opinion is never justified.  My wife just had a bacteria eat away some of her bone below her lower jaw tooth.  Many periodontists would still treat this using bone grafts, while a better treatment using a laser is available.  We selected a periodontist that uses the laser approach.
0.560000	My feelings are at a neutral state with my doctor. I feel this way because I believe that  physicians give you some truth but they can also throw in some lies as well. They are money-oriented so therefore they will do whatever they can to get you to spend more money.
0.800000	i trust my physician because she does a great job of going over different options to my problems. she doesn't just say there is only one path of treatment. she looks at the whole picture.
0.560000	I feel like a lot of the time the doctor is just more interested in getting out of the room as quickly as possible. Anytime a question is asked, there is a quick, rushed response as if the question was annoying. Sometimes I even ask for addition tests and they are disregarded as not needed even though there have been times when the additiol test would have helped healing faster and was later proven to be so.
0.440000	My doctor sends me for ultrasounds that I don't need. 
1.000000	When I first went to him, I was leaving a Dr that did not take my problems seriously. This Dr. listened, without interruption, to what was happening, asked many questions. He knew exactly what needed to be done to find and fix the problem. He never rushes his patients and always listens to what you're saying.
0.680000	Doctors have the training and knowledge to make good decisions about my health.  If I feel that a doctor is not thorough or knowledgeable, I'll find another doctor.
0.760000	I really trist my primary care provider first snd for most because he listens to me and respects my decisions. He is always willing to talk in depth with me about my concerns and answer questions and respectful of my medical choices even if they go against what he recommends. In the past he has gone out of his way to look into other treatment options for me and their effectiveness. He is also very respectful of my body and perspective- to elaborate he really takes into considerstion my persol reports about things where as other medical providers in the past have blown me off and insisted Im reporting symptoms wrong etc.
0.840000	I generally trust doctors and believe they have my best interest at heart.
0.560000	From what I've seen in the past several years, their too much emphasis on time magement and payroll correlation than on what's really beneficial for the patient. Issues are only addressed if it's convenient for the doctor and his/her staff. 
0.680000	sure about the situation
0.960000	Some would say that medical professiols can't be trusted most of the time because there are times that they will just neglect your opinion and ask you to follow their opinion for their own benefits.Yes, it is true in some instance.However, those behaviors depending on the person you are in contact with.People now in our society has different attitudes and point of view in life and what is important is we must be cautious.
0.760000	My doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. She will take the time to explain my health to me in order for me to understand and go thru many options when treatment arises. She is always patient and listens when I have questions or am worried about my health.
0.560000	He seems nice enough, and he tends to explain things adequately, but I never feel very comfortable with him. I've been in a few times with issues that he's diagnosed was stress or anxiety related muscle tension so I worry that he might think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.
0.640000	"I have been with the same primary care doctor for over 10 years now. For me persolly, I have never had a misdiagnosis or a recommendation that required further visits (I don't feel that my doctor is out to cheat people out of their money). However, I do agree that sometimes he might ""wing it"" during my physical checkups. However, I do put trust in him because I know that if there as really something serious, he would let me know. "
0.720000	I do not trust it sometimes. Because, some doctors do not look at the bright side and they are upset the people. And they do not look at the all type of test results. they see just some symptoms in report and they put the me of sickness. but they are not looking other side effect that cause the sickness.
0.960000	My doctor has never lead me wrong. My doctor has always given great advice.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he always makes me feel better.  He gives me exactly what I need to feel better.  He is a nice guy.  I like him.
0.640000	I do trust my doctor to a large degree. While I am aware they are going to suggest drugs based on their own connections with certain companies.
0.800000	I have had a long doctor/patient relationship with her and she always remembers the different reasons for which I have seen her and follows up. 
0.680000	I think they probably had altruistic motives in becoming a doctor.  I think their professiolism dictates that they act properly.  I think they're probably well-educated and intelligent. 
0.560000	Diagnosing a health issue is not very clear cut. Doctors may give their best guess at what's wrong but may be wrong. Getting an accurate diagnosis can involve a lot of testing, trial and error, or repeat visits. Doctors may take short cuts and prescribe medication based on what is most commonly seen rather than what may be most appropriate in a situation. For example, prescribing antibiotics when presented with generic cold symptoms (which may be caused by a virus).
0.720000	Like all professions not all doctors are perfect.
0.600000	I trust her, I suppose. I was afraid that I had cancer but I really just had canker sores and she gave me a prescription to get rid of them. But she is way too expensive to see!
0.680000	I know my doctor is not out to harm me.  I also understand there are other exterl forces at play (insurance requirements, patient requirements, regulatory requirements, etc.) that can affect treatment.  I believe it is in both my interest and my doctor's interest to be honest with each other and have that level of trust.
0.720000	I trust that my doctor is not going to do anything overtly damaging regarding my care however I do not trust that he is willing to fully treat some medical issues of mine. I have severe anxiety and depression and my doctor is unwilling to treat this issues medically to my satisfaction which causes some quality of life issues for me that greatly reduce my functiolity as a person.
0.600000	I basically trust my physician because she was able to help me with an issue that a previous doctor did not attempt to address.  I also feel that she listens to my problems and takes them seriously.  However, due to previous experiences with doctors, I am uble to trust any of them completely. 
0.720000	I trust my care physician to gather the information he needs to make an informed decision. I trust them to be honest in their assessments and recommendations.  That said I don't always trust that they are giving me every reasoble option and sometimes feel I need to prod for altertives (real Western medicine altertives, not to be confused with altertive-medicine).  Sometimes with prescription recommendations I get concerned over whether I can trust my care physician due shady pharma-reps.
0.440000	I have experienced negative doctor outcomes with members of my family, including my husband, Mother and Father. I therefore question everyhing when it comes to dealing with doctors. 
0.600000	I respect and trust in the ability, expertise and intentions of my physician. However, he is still just a person, and no one is infallible.
0.800000	My doctor seems to really want me to understand what problem I have and how to correct/ prevent it.
0.560000	"As recently as TODAY, May 4, 2017, the US Congress is voting on repealing ""Obama-care"". This whole concept of the free market guiding healthcare is absurd. The US is long overdue to adopting tiolized health. I hate to use this worn out saying but, if the US can put men on the Moon, and now spacecraft to Mars and Pluto, then the US can easily have basic healthcare to cover its' citizens. Doctors are hindered by insurance companies and people have ridiculous expectations as to what healthcare should be."
0.480000	I feel like there are too many profit based motivating factors with doctors in America that directly work against my best interest. I hear all the time about doctors strongly recommending expensive tests that prove to be unneeded in the eyes of a second opinion. 
0.520000	He takes time with me, but I think he probably does not try very hard (probably due to dealing with people).  He does not seem to try to find the cause, just treat the symptoms.  I don't distrust him, I just trust my research more.
0.520000	My doctor is a bit snobbish, so I sometimes worry that he thinks so highly of his opinions that he fails to consider other points of view that might actually be valid. He has a lot of pride because of his immense experience and impressive education. But perhaps he has too much pride. 
0.400000	I don't really have a lot of trust in the medical decisions of doctors. There is almost always pressure to diagnose and get the next patient in as quickly as possible. If I had serious concerns that I wasn't sure of I would get a second opinion. Just a few days ago I read about a women who was told her breast cancer was only cysts and the cancer spread throughout her body in the year after her diagnosis, and she wishes she had got a second opinion. The cancer is termil for her and she is only in her early 30's. 
0.800000	It has always been a very open and honest type of discussion between us. Nothing ever hidden with facts and consequences always fully disclosed.  
0.320000	I have seen doctors talk about how canbis is dangerous and can make you hallucite, and then proceed to put my mother on opiates as if they were a safer altertive for pain (with full knowledge of the fact that she was also on SSRIs and benzos). Once she was addicted to opiates, they treated her like an addict. When she quit her pills she lost her mind. She is now in rehab for alcohol and illicit drugs. She never drank or did any drugs before her doctors put her on pills. Meth and heroin are schedule 2 drugs, while canbis/ mdma/ psilocybin/ and lsd are classified as schedule 1 (no medical benefit). I guess I distrust the system more than the doctors, but they mostly have to buy in to the system to make it through med school.
0.800000	I haven't experienced a doctor who didn't prioritizes my needs. I know there are doctors that aren't completely honest and are only interested in their pay check, but I don't believe I've ever met one.
0.760000	Icompletly trust my primary care physician because I have been a patents of his for years 
1.000000	I have been with him for many years and he has always looked out for me. He was instrumental in diagnosing a serious condition that  when corrected completely changed my life. He also makes sure I understand what he says and follows up. I feel lucky to have him as my doctor.
0.960000	My doctor treats me like a friend, breaks everything down so I can understand her. She is extremely friendly.
0.200000	because they try to lie to me that im going to be fine when in reality im not fine....
1.000000	My PCP was researched well enough and my persol interactions have been very professiol. I can find no reasons so far o distrust my PCP, and if I did I would not see this person for anything.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I trust my hospital. My hospital has a really good reputation. I have been them for years.
0.520000	Sometimes doctors aren't up on the latest research. I've had experiences where doctors let their prejudice against me affect the care I've received. Sometimes doctors don't understand how multiple conditions interact with each other. I think that while most of them are well-meaning and generally competent, they're also busy and stressed and sometimes get stuck in their habits. 
0.800000	All of the doctors I've ever met have been extremely calm and thorough with everything. They always go through procedures and explain exactly what they think and what I should do and why I should do it. I trust them very much and have no reason not to. 
0.600000	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable in the heath field than I am and I have to trust because there is no other option.
0.760000	After speaking with several primary care physicians, I have concluded that this group generally cares deeply about patients and acts in their best interests. I believe doctors make mistakes or seem cold sometimes because of work pressure and empathy fatigue.
0.840000	My doctor has been helping me and my mother for years and has only recommended things in my best interest. If I hadn't moved away from home I would still use her as my main physician.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she has given my no reason not to trust her.  She explains her thought process when it comes to diagnosing any issues I am having and she explains the pros and cons of various treatment options.  If she makes a recommendation for a certain course of action she explains why.  I guess maybe a primarily trust my doctor because she is transparent.
0.680000	I just feel like when I visit my doctor or doctors, that I am just another person for them to get  through. I feel that they are always in a rush to get in and out. Its not always because they have other people to see, sometimes it just feels like they are ready to take a break and they rush just to get out. 
0.800000	It's simply in their best interest to do their job to the best of their abilities. There's little to gain and a lot to risk if they do otherwise. Of course they're humans so they're not perfect and things happen sometimes.
0.760000	I think most doctors are out to help you. There are some money hungry ones who just want to earn as much as possible and do not care much about you, but all in all, I think most doctors generally care about their patients. 
0.560000	my doctor makes me nervous. sometimes i feel belittled. sometimes i understand things but not fully and do not want to seem dumb so don't ask for examples. 
0.960000	I have gone to him a few times in the past couple years.  He has always been diligent and has diagnosed my conditions correctly each time.  He had to do a couple small procedures which went great.  I have gotten better each time and have had no complications when recovering.  He has done a fantastic job.  Takes the time to make sure he knows what is wrong and goes over everything I need to know and answers my questions.
0.640000	Because you asked about my GP, I usually see him when it's about something specific. Generally he listens, performs a few simple, superficial tests and then refers me to a specialist.
0.200000	Doctors do not respect the moral or philosophical views which differ from their own regarding treatment. They treat symptoms and not underlying causes of illness and they do this by pushing medications that cause more harm and side effects to the body, thereby increasing the problems (and the number of medications) that one must battle.
0.560000	In the end I feel neutral towards doctors. I know there are some that are good but I have had mixed experiences with them. Whether it be misdiagnosis, bad bedside manner, over charging, etc. So it is hard to feel anything but neutral towards them. But you have to have enough blind faith in them to get the job done because that is what they are educated in. 
0.840000	I have been seeing this doctor for years and I trust his judgement. I have never had any issues or problems with him that would make me doubt his ability or honesty. I am comfortable with him as well.
0.800000	I believe my doctor is competent and knowledgable.  She has specialized training, so I often defer to her.  She is always professiol, and I trust the hospital she works for.  She is a good person who genuinely seems interested in promoting my health and well being.
0.720000	My doctor has been honest with me since I've been with her. 
0.800000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care doctor. My first meeting with her was a little awkward because it seemed like she was a little distracted and it took a little time for that feeling to go away. Subsequent appointments have been much more relaxed and she has been pretty easy to talk to. She always gives thorough explations and goes over my lab results with me, paying closer attention to anything that has changed since my last appointment. I feel very comfortable asking her questions. She gives me time to ask questions and give me good answers. She also hasn't hesitated to give me referrals to specialists when that has been needed. Overall I find her to be very helpful and knowledgeable.
0.800000	I have always had very good doctors and fully trust there opinions. Both of my parents are doctors and I think that influences my opinions of doctors. I trust my parents so I trust other doctors too. I have never had reason to not trust my doctors.
1.000000	I trust my doctors because they've always been honest with me.
0.760000	I feel my doctor is rather caring about my medical needs. He tries his best to cover all bases when an issue comes about to elimite any possibilities of what the issue can be causing any underlying illness.
0.920000	I have been going to this same doctor for several years; I feel she knows me well. She considers my emotiol status as well as my physical status to determine the best course of treatment for me.
0.560000	I trust somewhat because of professiol training but sometimes I feel like they have so much on their shoulders that they might just write off some of my concerns and think of the first thing that comes on their mind to solve my problem so they can get to the next patient
0.600000	He has actually listened and seem more concerned than most doctors I have had in the past. I trust him, to an extent, because he seems to listen and try to figure out the best action to take, but since I have had testing on things that were expensive and still had no resolution and he seems to not have as much experience as others, I do not completely trust him.
1.000000	I've known my family doctor for a very long time and trust him on a persol level in addition to a professiol one.
0.840000	Been my doctor for a long time. Family and friends have gone to him for 15+ years. He is very smart and knowledgeable. He has never told me anything that was wrong or iccurate. He is also the head doctor for the hospital next to his practice. 
0.640000	I do trust them, but I want to be informed as it is my body, and I want to agree with everything that is done to it, or put a stop if I am not. 
0.600000	I trust doctors in general, but they are human and can make mistakes. And then there are some who are not very good at what they do. My trust is conditiol.
0.560000	ALL DOCTORS WANT IS MONEY
1.000000	My doctor is a candid, relaxed older gentleman who seems to always say exactly what he means. He has never given me the impression that he's in a hurry to see other patients, or that he wants to quickly diagnose me. He's put me through thorough tests, asked me a lot of questions, and suggested many options to me.  The fact that he's so thorough and patient makes me completely trust him to act in my best interests.
0.560000	I don't have a primary doctor but I do feel that most doctors that I have dealt with of very trustworthy. I haven't had any issues of being mislead of being misinformed over any medical situation. Most doctors I have dealt with seem sincere and show concern. 
0.400000	My primary care physician is a very nice, warm, friendly woman, and I liked her immediately upon meeting her. However, during our last appointment, she prescribed a medication that has awful side effects, some side effects that I had expressed concern about with her during that same appointment, so I was disappointed to read about those side effects after picking the medication up from the pharmacy and that made me second guess my immediate trust in this physician. 
0.760000	I have always trusted my doctor.  He has been my persol doctor ever since I had my first heart attack.  I can say I do not trust his nurses due to their ruse behavior, but my doctor yes.  He has done persol visits to my home before and has taken good care of my health after my first heart attack experience.  I feel much better now than before. 
0.800000	I think for the most part doctors are persoble and want to help their patients. Doctors are generally fairly nice to their patients and want to find the best care practice for them.
0.480000	In regard's to doctor's in general, I have a lack of trust of doctor's for the reason that I have had multiple friend's and loved one's die from cancer. Cancer is a business in this country and patient's with cancer are not told the complete truth when it comes to treating cancer.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he if very thorough and explains things well. He is very caring and takes time out at the beginning of my visit to ask about my life and family. He never rushes his patients and takes a good amount of time with them.
0.560000	I feel that today doctors are just trying not to get sued. So they go with the safest least liable option always and what is convent cause the most patients they see means the most money for them. 
0.440000	My primary care physician does not care to fully diagnose me or most of his patients for that matter. He will do a series of tests or ask questions to get a general idea of what may be wrong, and will then prescribe antibiotics, painkillers, etc. without even confirming I actually need the medicine.
0.960000	I have used the same clinic for 20 years and even though there have been times when they have had to try different treatments to figure out what works I have always felt that they have had my best interest in mind. Sometimes they will start with a treatment that cost the least in order to help me out fincially so that I do not have to spend excess money on test and prescriptions. They have always seemed to be upfront and honest with me and other members of my family.
0.560000	I've been seeing my doctor for a long time and he hasn't ever really steered me wrong, but I also haven't really ever dealt with any serious health problems. I have family members who have stopped seeing this doctor because they thought he wasn't taking the time necessary to deal with their conditions, but until that happens to me or if I have a condition I don't think he can handle I will continue to see him.
0.800000	I have never had any problems with my primary care physician. He is very experienced, wise , efficient and considerate. 
0.440000	Most doctors are in the pockets of big pharma, and too willing just to prescribe pills insteas of really looking into the problem.
0.880000	I have been seeing him for a few years now. He is very thorough and he explains things to me very well when I have questions.
0.440000	My feeling towards them stem from a simply fact they only want there money. They provide only temporally fix to the issue just so you visit them again.
0.440000	Even though I have been going for at least 4 years, he often mistakes details about my conditions.  Also there is a language barrier communication problem.  He often prescribes medications which I find out later are harmful to take given some of my other conditions.  Unfortutely he is one of the only providers of my insurance carrier within my local area. Some of the problems I try to fix by writing out questions.  All in all, he will correct mistakes when I point them out.
0.720000	I trust my doctor's abilities and believe him to be honest. That being said, he has hundreds of patients and I'm not his friend or family member. I'm sure he does a great job, but why should I have complete trust in another person, just because they are my doctor. I don't have complete trust in my friends or family members, why should my doctor be any different? 
0.840000	I tend to trust my physical because he feels like he is knowledgeable. He also doesn't seem like someone who rushes through patients. He takes the time to answer any questions I might have. He seems to care.
0.800000	I have been a patient with my doctor for a while.  I have a good rapport with him.  He is thorough and follows up well.  He explains things well and answers any questions.  I trust his judgement and opinion.
0.840000	MY PHYISICIAN IS GOD FEARING
0.720000	I would trust my primary car physician because it is a doctor that you regularly see and they know you and your health. they will know if something is wrong.
0.760000	I trust her because she is very professiol and through with everything. I have had her for several years and always glad to see her
0.840000	My PCP is very mellow and always has a calm demeanor when engaging with me. He asks questions, is not judgmental when hearing my responses, and often makes suggestions about types of treatment even when I am always willing to go with whatever he recommends first. He has never rushed me during our meetings and I never felt that he saw me as just another patient or that he only saw his profession as just work; he seems to genuinely care about all his clients.
0.720000	I trust physicians, however sometimes I believe they are too busy to fully disclose all options for medial treatments and typically provide the fastest answers as possible. Sometimes I feel like physicians could be a little more thourough, but there's only so much they can do with the time they're allotted, especially with large work loads/multiple patients.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he will tell me that I'm doing something wrong. For example, my blood sugars were elevated and he told me directly that if I don't cut down my candy consumption, he will not see me as a patient anymore. He really cares for my health and not only that but explains things in real context.
0.880000	she is my age and is very intelignet She is going throght some of the same issues I am and i just connect with her so much and trust her a lot she is  a contol freak but i love it anyway its good for me!!
0.720000	My doctor seems sincere in his concern for my problems. He typically lays out what I need to know about my condition. He seems to make as much time for me as possible despite seeming like he is always busy.
0.600000	Because it would lead towards others not being truthful with their things
0.600000	There are two levels of trust I have for a person who is providing me a service. The trust of them as a person and the trust in the service they're providing. I trust must doctors as good people, but that doesn't mean they can't make mistakes or not be adequately informed about something. I may rely on a doctor, but that doesn't mean I trust him or her 100%.
0.800000	I have gone to the same primary care physician for the past twenty years.  He has always been patient, upfront, and honest with me.  He has never given me a reason to second guess his intentions or information. 
0.840000	My doctor is very bright and because of this I have learned to trust her more and more.   It is my own persol distrust of people that made me not trust her 100% when I first starting going to her for care.
1.000000	He is a board certified doctor. He has over 40 years experience in the field. 
0.600000	I am kind of in the middle on this. I neither trust or distrust. I believe that my doctor might not be able to devote as much time to my health as is necessary to make the best health decisions possible. 
0.960000	I love my doctor!  I started seeing him several years ago because of some mild but confusing symptoms a GP thought needed special attention from an endocrinologist.  My mom had been seeing this doctor- Dr. Marcus- for some time before, so I had a good recommendation.  Dr. Marcus is very kind, very thorough, and an impression diagnostician.  He was able to guess at possible causes for what seemed like very strange symptoms and had me take various tests to confirm things and rrow down the possibilities.  He always answers all my questions and believes strongly in preventative medicine.
0.760000	I've had some pretty negative experiences with PCPs. Mostly due to the fact I smoke canbis and don't want medication. I and my new PCP find that canbis is much safer than being prescribed benzos and adderall my whole life.I trust her because it doesn't seem like she is pushing pills.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and open.  She tells me why she makes a diagnosis.  She gives me time to ask questions.
0.720000	I like my primary care physician but I must be cautious. Although my doctor cares for his patients' well-being, he does seem to push prescriptions rather than talking about potential altertives. I do not feel he is wrong in prescribing the medications for most of his patients but I have a strong desire to seek out altertive treatments.
0.800000	In general my physician does a thorough job. Never seem to be in a rush or anything.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to treat what symptoms I have explained to him but sometimes I do not know how to explain my symptoms and will have to make a couple of trips to the doctor's office to get the correct diagnosis. 
0.840000	My primary doctor is really good with patients and caring.  I think she has her patient's best interest in her heart.  She is careful not to give me too many pills of the same med.  For example she didn't want to give me any more of the pink blood pressure med, so she gave me a different one so I could have more of what I needed but not too much of one kind.  
0.960000	I trust my primary care because I believe that he really cares for my well-being.
0.800000	Overall, I trust my physician.  He is professiol, courteous, and always patient in answering my questions.  He is also prompt and ready, when I set an appointment with him.  He is also open-minded and discuss various options and aspects about my health.
0.560000	I have a friend who highly distrusts most doctors due to her extensive experience with them, and I trust her judgements about things. However, I have seen nothing strange from my own doctor. 
0.800000	They always take their time, aren't rushed and explain to me any test results.  They have a conversation with me rather than just reporting things.  They have a genial and relaxed manner.
0.760000	She has been open about what I have and how to treat them.  She seems to listen me sincerely and in a warm, attentive manner.  It doesn't look like she's going through the motions of pretending to listen and care about me, not brushing me off if I have concerns or questions, and she is accommodating towards me.  She also provides articles that she has her nurse print out for me to take home and study about treatments and conditions.
0.680000	I think that I trust my doctor but always try to relay on my own instincts also. If there is something that I don't agree with or a treatment that I'm not sure about, I always wait and do my own research before jumping on board. 
0.720000	I have a good doctor.  In most things I trust what she says.  However I am responsible for my own care and if something seems risky it is best to get more information on it first.  I try to avoid taking a lot of medications that has bad side effects.  
1.000000	I feel really good when I go to my doctor because I know that I can go in the office with a bunch of questions and I will have them all answered by the time I leave. I do not feel rushed, which is a huge deal for me. I think my doctor is thorough and very interested in my as a patient rather than just a number or someone written in his appointment book.
0.800000	My doctor listens to me and thinks about what to do often if he can not figure things out he will send me to a specialist.
0.720000	"My primary care physician treats me with respect and understanding. He has great ""bedside manners"". He always listens to my needs, likes, and dislikes. "
0.360000	My husband and I moved to a new state and we didn't know anything about a Primary Care Physician, so we looked up who seemed to be best in this town.  The doctor was not taking on new patients, but there was another doctor in his practice.  This doctor who I just mentioned is awful!  He barely seems to care when I have an issue and need his help.  We are currently looking for a new PCP and are getting ideas from others who we trust.  Also, our previous PCP where we used to live was AMAZING!  She took her time, asked questions and made sure that I was cared for!  That just makes this new PCP so much worse!
0.320000	I don't see the doctor frequently enough for them to know me or my health, so it'd be difficult for them to be particularly insightful. They are usually behind and seem very rushed. They don't really examine me or ask questions. They'll look at the part pertinent to the complaint that prompted the visit and prescribe the treatment I would have guessed I needed before I went in.
0.800000	My doctor always takes the time to explore the best treatment options. He explains them in a manner that is easy to understand, the benefits and downsides of procedures, and how I should go about certain routines. He does not make me feel pressured, does not force decisions on me, and makes sure I complete agree with something before moving forward. 
0.560000	I don't know them well; we're on insurance and don't get top notch treatment, and I don't know the doctors well enough to know how objective they are.
0.800000	I went to many doctors before I chose mine. She is very caring and very careful and attentive. I can tell she really cares and has my best interest at heart. 
0.760000	My doctor asks questions to be sure he is treating me effectively.  He listens without judgment (as I have encountered with another doctor) and he doesn't make me feel belittled.  
0.520000	I feel that i am just a number and a pay check most of the time. I have had a few different pain issues over the last 10 years that no medicine, exercise or checkup has been able to diagnose, help, or fix. 
0.760000	I do not know my primary care doctor.  He was assigned to me with the ovomitdon'tcare tax went into effect.  I have yet to be able to get an appointment with him.  Every time I need a doctor, I call and, first, I am told he is not taking any new patients.  When I tell them he is my assigned doctor, I am told the first available appointment is 6 to 8 months away.  Thanks to the ovomitdon'tcare tax, the emergency room is my primary care doctor.  I answered the above questions based on the two times in the past 4 years I have had to go to the emergency room.
0.560000	I have only seen my physician twice.  I do not know him that well. I believe that he is capable, and that he really does want to keep me healthy as can be.  At the same time I think he is also out to make money, which may mean unnecessary tests.  I have to see him more to find out if I really trust him before I am willing to say that I do.
0.280000	I have been repeatedly misdiagnosed and handed pharmaceuticals that only mask the symptoms, not treat the problem. The doctors often seem so preoccupied with getting to their next patient that they don't care to take the time to properly resolve my ailment(s).
0.520000	Some are not very persoble and always feels like they're in a rush.  The ones who have practicing for too long appear to fit this description.  It seems they have loss interest in their profession.  
0.320000	I'm not very trusting of him, because he shows no concern or care for the problem he is treating. His main focus is money, and when he recommends a treatment or medication, I need to go and research it myself to make sure it is even a viable option. He has suggested some options that are laughable at best.
0.480000	When I've gone to my physician or even one at an emergency care facility they often try to rush you and generalize what is going on. This would be when you explain symptoms and you say you've had a bad cough for three weeks and they just blow you off and tell you there is a cold going around and when you end up in an emergency room you find out you had a bacterial infection in your lungs. Its hard to trust them as it's a business now and they move people in and out like cattle. If you're lucky your Dr will spend 5 minutes with you but the nurses usually do all the interview work.
0.800000	He is a good doctor and has always given me the best care possible. He is always willing to see me on a last minute basis if I need to come in. 
0.960000	My doctor is very truthful to me and she always tells me exactly what I want to hear, which is the truth. She is very qualified and I consider her one of the best doctors in the area.
0.800000	I don't know.  I am not going to put a whole lot of though into why I trust my doctor.  I suppose, if he had ever given me any reason not to trust him, he would not be my doctor any more.
0.480000	Doctors don't really seem to take their time with the patients, that's usually the nurses job, so they don;t seem to care too much or the cherry-picked the patients they went to care about..and I generally don't just anyone that pushes unnecessary medications and treatment on their patients so they can line their pockets or an money for their hospital. 
0.840000	Over the years, my doctor has proven that he knows my issues, listens to me carefully and always makes the right choices for me about my care and well being. I completely trust him because he has fixed many conditions and proactively treated me to prevent complications and other issues.
0.560000	I've found that physicians rarely agree which makes me nervous.  Often there are treatments or reseasrch on existing treatments that unengaged doctors are not aware of.
0.680000	He's very open and discusses the options with me openly.  He takes the time to answer my questions and provide me with options.  What he's done so far has worked well.
0.800000	I trust them because I don't think they would want to hurt me.
0.720000	Most time my health got recover after seem them.  Their got high degree and was well  train. 
0.720000	Yes I trust my physician. I generally trust most people unless they give me a reason not to.
0.560000	I believe my doctor is competent and concerned. He is  nearing retirement himself and is pretty conventiol in his thinking. Old school is his approach and he doesn't stretch his thinking to consider newer treatment options. I think there is some value in looking at treatments like acupuncture, pain magement techniques beyond meds and holistic treatments. He pooh-poohs such ideas and finds fault with altertive practitioners. So I believe he has my best interest at heart but I think he stopped expanding his views on what options might be.
0.960000	Their overall experience and rating among the community. I have not heard any bad statements about them.
0.280000	I don't like or trust her, she comes in looks at my chart prescribes another pill and walks out without hardly talking to me.
0.720000	I generally trust my primary care physicians. However, I've had recent experiences where the judgment was wrong and it's since made me somewhat skeptical. Two doctors prescribed an antibiotic that wasn't the right choice for treating an infection that almost led to serious consequences. I ended getting advice on a different medicine from family friends that ultimately led to a change in medication. While that experience has made me a little skeptical, I still generally trust doctors and think they have my best interests at heart.
0.400000	I don't have a primary care physician.  I think doctors in general, such as the doctors I've gone to in the past, want to get you out of there as quickly as possible so they want to avoid finding out anything more about a situation or saying anything specific to the individual and not generic.  I generally don't think doctors have taken me seriously.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he has taken an oath to treat his patients as such. No doctor wants the reputaion of bad advice. They take this seriously to become esteemed physicians in the USA.
0.920000	The doctor always takes their time when dealing with me and he doesn't feel likes he is in a hurry. He explains every thing that I need to know and ask me if I have any questions. He makes always has me come back for a check up when I get medicine that I need to see if it is working like it supposed to. I do trust my doctor to act on my interests.
0.840000	i feel that i can trust my doctor because they always give me all the information that i could possibly need regarding treatment plans. they always treat me like a person. and whe also treats the whole person not just the issue and she doesn't just try to push pharmaceuticals on patients.
0.400000	I do not fully trust my doctor because it's just hard for me to do. I like to do my own research and find tural homeopathic ways of doing things.
0.480000	the doctor i used to see,seemed to just want to prescribe more pills.even though the previous prescription didnt help.almost like he was guessing.
0.840000	I usually have been healthy so my doctor visits are really short but If there is a problem my doctor is right on top of it and either gets me help or helps me right away by getting me an appointment with the appropriate physician.
0.880000	I trust PCP because I have been a patient of his for over 10 years and I have never got the feeling he has ever been less than truthful with me. 
1.000000	I trust my doctors because they help me get what I need for my kids and make sure they are healthy.
0.840000	The doctor always explains the medical problem in detail, and doesn't assume you know what he is talking about.  He thoroughly answers all my questions about the problem or the options.
0.840000	They have been with me since I was young and have built a reputation 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have known her for a long time and she always have time to see me and my family in case of any emergency. She is always honest and straight forward about my medical issues.
0.680000	I trust my doctor and their diagnosis because I feel that they take the time to listen to my symptoms.  They also take time to evaluate my problem areas and run the necessary test to get a proper diagnosis.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to give me the best treatment options. That the doctor's job after all, to help me feel better. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor and like her but I would not place complete trust in just one person.
0.640000	I have to rely on my primary care physician, because I I don't have any other options to get medical advice. I am distrustful of him on some level, because he is driven by his business interest first very often.
0.800000	if you cant trust you doctor who can you trust i trust him because he took an oath and is in the service buseiness the buseinss of caring adn heping
0.960000	My doctor is very forthright and honest, they give me the information that I need to know and will give me ideas on what I can honestly do to help make myself healthier or achieve my goals.
0.760000	I do trust my doctor.  I have been seeing the same doctor for about 15 years and I know him very well.  He always has my best interest in mind.
0.440000	My doctor is pretty old, and set in his ways. I haven't been to him that many times since I moved here, but the times that I have been to him he was not that great. He seemed to rush through appointments, not spending much time with me. The information he gave me about an issue I had seemed pretty outdated, so I didn't take his advice on that. I have been meaning to find another primary caregiver, but I have not found the time to do it yet.
0.600000	I trust doctors I general to a degree, but often I think they are too overbooked to provide the attention most patients need or would like. I think they check symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and a treatment plan, but don't stick around to fully answer patients questions. I feel like a wait around for the doctor and then am rushed once they arrive.
0.280000	I am seeing my doctor for about 2 years.   I have to visit him every 4 weeks.  I distrust him because he doesn't answers the questions important me .  He just follows standard procedures every time.
0.800000	My current PCP is much better than some I've had in the past. She is still hurried at times due to her full office visit schedule, but does her best to spend all the available time productively. She uses electronic communication when possible to continue conversations. This is a great improvement over past doctors who have listened to one or two symptoms, fired off a prescription, and hurried out.
0.960000	I have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor. I always got the feeling that they really care about my health and what is best for me.
0.320000	Doctors are always trying to get you to take medications that don't really cure the condition. Their priorities are to the pharmaceutical company and not to the patient. They are not in the business of trying to get people well, just getting patients to take medicines to mage the illness.
0.520000	It seems that doctors can be too detached from their patients. They can sometimes forget patients are people not problems. 
0.960000	My doctor tell me like it is ,he always tell me if im doing good are bad. and will call and see how im doing on the meds and to make sure im taking them the way he wants me to,
0.800000	My doctor has gained my trust within the past year by discovering a serious problem with my thyroid in the process of examining me for rhumatism. I would not have known this if he had not taken the trouble to examine my blood tests carefully and sent me for more specific tests. This process has definitely made me trust his competence and thoroughness.
0.760000	If I did not trust my physician I would change and find one that I would.  I trust my physician currently as I watch how he lives his life outside of the medical field.  Church, community, family.  I judge their ethics away from work to get a feel and add it to how Im treated and the discussions at the office.  Its usually going to see other doctors (any little thing you always have to go see somebody else or 2 or 3) where I have my problems with trust, don't have many to choose from so have to use doctors that are available.
0.760000	I have had my primary care doctor for years and it's obvious she's someone who truly cares about her patients and isn't just trying to make money or has been burned out by the job. More than once she has told me I might want to get a second opinion on something, which only increases my trust in her, for I much prefer that rather than a doctor who thinks they're always right.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he tells me what is happening without sugar coating it and I really appreciate that.
0.800000	I think he is mostly trustworthy and competent.
0.760000	I feel that physicians are highly qualified, of course more so that me, with the knowledge on medical issues. A PCP knows you and there is trust in that
0.840000	"I trust pcp a lot. She has been my doctor for several years and she has been great. She knows me well and works with me to help me mage my health problems. I'm not ""just another number"" with her. "
0.720000	i trust my doctor because she takes time to give me as much information and advice as possible and does not shy away from my questions. Most importantly i find that doing want she advice's me actually helps and improves my health and happiness. She is also very kind and friendly.
0.480000	I don't put too much trust in my doctor and I always research the pills he prescribes me. The reason for this is that I know a lot of big companies offer money to doctors so they prescribe their pills. I've seen few documentaries about it.
1.000000	I have built up a great relationship with my doctor.  He allows me to contact him anytime and that makes a very persol relationship. 
0.480000	I really have little experience with my primary physician, one incident that stands out is her interpretation of an x-ray when I injured my ankle.  Upon viewing it she decided that there was no fracture, when we looked at it together I thought there looked to be a small fracture - she insisted that what I saw was a vein.  Later that evening I received a call from the radiologist who had reviewed my x-rays and he confirmed that there was a fracture.
0.800000	I trust my doctor.  She never seems to be too busy or distracted to answer my questions.  She is not arrogant some some doctors I have know.  She asks a number of questions about how I am feeling.  She responds very persollybout any medical tests or lab work that I have done.
0.600000	I'd like to trust my doctor more. The issue is that he sees so many patients I often feel like a number. He gets in a rush during appointments. I trust him as far as I can, but I'd prefer to have a doctor that could give me more individualized attention. Sadly that isn't an option for me at this time.
0.760000	Because with them I feel very safe
0.560000	I had to switch plans and have no history with this doctor. His entire knowledge of me is post traumatic times. He doesn't know when I was healthy enogh to do normal things but i look perfectly fine. I describe chronic issues that I think he considers whiny or malingering. He is only my doctor because I can access his location the easiest. He seems to be a doctor who prefers wealthy clients. That being said he did I.D. one condition that others had missed or advocated wild treatments for. That is the basis of the level of trust I DO have in him.
0.520000	i just got a new primary physician not too long ago so i dont know him too well. overall i think some doctors, especially psychiatrists (my primary care doctor is a psychiatrist as well) do what is most convenient for themselves.
0.320000	Most of them are paid to push certain drugs on me.  I have a condition that through many doctors, i am uble to ever have two of them agree about it.  I constantly get conflicting info about it.
0.560000	Doctors generally have other considerations besides a patient's optimal treatment. They can be fincially influenced by pharmaceutical organizations and recommend newer and different medications. They can also be driven by profits when recommending procedures that may not be necessary. They also may avoid certain treatments because they do not have the knowledge to recommend them, or they may want to avoid liability. 
0.280000	I currently do not have a primary care physician for the simple fact that I can't find one who is willing to look past their training and realize that not everybody is an identical copy of another. Most of the ones I have encountered are medicine pushers. For those who can't, or would rather not take traditiol forms of western medicine, finding a doctor who believes or takes you seriously is a very difficult task. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because we have a great understanding. We are able to openly communicate and I can also ask any questions that I have. I am comfortable with my doctors. I usually only have doctors I use if I feel comfortable with them.
0.560000	I have never really had an experience where I totally trusted a doctor. I usually go for annual physical exams and it doesn't seem like they really check all the things they should be checking. I think they have a routine to go through and there's very little else above that.  
0.720000	I do not necessarily distrust my physician I simply don't completely trust anyone. I value my doctors opinions and suggestions greatly but ultimately I make my own decisions. 
0.560000	I don't have a primary care right now but my specialist that treats me has always been trustworthy and is a very pleasant doctor to deal with.
0.960000	My doctor is very persoble and doesn't talk down to you when he explains things. I have been lucky enough to not have any serious health issues in a long time, so I don't really have any reason to distrust him. He's never given me anything that I'd call bad advice, and he did give me some useful info about the tension headaches that I get now and then.
0.600000	I dont trust anyone to  be honest but i would hope doctors can be trusted to do what is in the best interest for my health 
0.840000	Honestly, my doctor is from my community and i have this doctor as our family doctor since last 7 years. From the experience my doctor is being honest about our health condition.
1.000000	He is caring and listens to what I have to say and how I feel.  He has had to pass all the testing done to become a Doctor and I don't think many untrustworthy people can pass all the testing that is done.  And he has taken an oath to do no harm all trustworthy people will adhere to any oath they take.
0.600000	overall I think doctors are trust worthy but there are a few sketchy doctors out there and that makes people not want to trust any of them. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he has never failed to solve my problems, he has always done his best to find the best solutions for me.
0.560000	I don't fully trust any doctor. Any person can make a mistake. Also you never know how a person really is and how much they really care.
0.880000	He examines me throughly and he runs test if needed.  I see a neurolgist due to a muscle disorder.  I have seen him for the past five years.  He has helped me with every aspect of this disease. Ran every test possible.  Also discussed my diagnosis with other neurologist.   He explains everything so I and my husband completely understand
0.800000	I trust doctors because when I do have to see them they are always willing to answer all of my question. I have not had any issues with a doctor not spending enough time with me to makes sure I understand all the options available to me. I haven't had a doctor make a poor decision in my healthcare.
0.760000	because they always show me how much they care about me.They answer any questions I have and calm me.
0.560000	I have a primary care doctor.  Sometimes he does not seem as thorough as he could be in medical checkups.  Or he keeps wanting to send me to specialists for things he could do himself
0.600000	I don't fully trust my doctor because sometimes I feel he just wants to get me in and out and like he doesn't take much time asking me questions. I have to always tell him I have some questions so he answers them, rather than him asking me if I  have any questions or concerns.
0.560000	I don't trust or distrust them. They are very busy and medicine is complicated so I'm sure they will make many mistakes.
0.560000	Majority doctors are trustworthy but i feel that some can't be bothered much. Just looking for there persol benefits. 
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because i believe him.
0.720000	I have been with them for awhile so I feel confident that they can get the job done right and will provide me with the proper care and diagnosis.
1.000000	My doctor is very good at his job. He's also very honest with me. He works hard to help me stay healthy no matter how much work it is for him. That is why I trust him completely. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he listens to and trust what I have to say about what is going on with me and doesn't try to tell me that I don't know myself and my own body. He talks to me and doesn't talk down to me and I believe he provides me all the information that he has about me and my condition.
0.920000	My primary care physician takes the time to fully explain things to me, because she knows I want to know what I am taking. She never rushes me. She never tries to give me medicine that she knows won't work just because she is getting a kickback from the company. She doesn't over-medicate patients, only prescribing medicine if she really believes I need it. The only times I distrust her is when we disagree on a course of action. But the fact that she allows me to disagree, and talk it over with her makes me trust her more. 
0.240000	My experiences with doctors in general has been extremely negative.I once broke my ankle and the medical staff wanted to amputate.I refused treatment got a second opinion,had surgery and now walk fine.I had an infection from stepping on a il.The doctor said I would die if I didnt go through a horrific procedure.I refused treatment again and am still alive and healthy.I find most doctors lack the proper skills to diagnose and treat medical problems and have lost faith in the system.If I had trusted the doctors I dealt with in the past I would be in terrible shape.Im glad I was brave enough to stand up to these individuals who are trusted with peoples lives and health and find the proposition of consulting with a doctor as scary and unreliable.
0.760000	At the moment I don't have a primary care physician so I am answering based on my previous doctors and the many doctors I have taken my parents to.  I believe all these doctors are trying to be responsible and do their best.  But primary care physicians are much too quick to prescribe a pill or CHANGE medication based on one reading in their office (especially for blood pressure). I honestly don't believe some doctors understand that 'more' or a drug is not necessarily better. I don't think doctors have much time (or take much time) to problem solve these days.  I think they often make sp judgements based on how much your symptom looks or sounds like somebody else's rather than assuming your symptom might be unique.
0.760000	Most doctors listen to patient concerns.  
0.960000	I feel my doctor (or nurse practitioner) has my best interests in mind because she is always thorough and helpful when we meet with her.  She listens and troubleshoots any issues we have. 
0.240000	"In general, when dealing with a physician, I find that they are blatantly unconcerned with the welfare of their patients up to the point at which they have concerns about legal liability. The vast majority of physician are running assembly line medical practices and are far more concerned about how many patients a day they can move through their office in much the same way that servers in high-volume restaurants are concerned about how many tables they can move during their shift: It is the attempt to /appear/ to care rather than actual concern for the person who is being cared for. That said, I have been fortute enough to have experiences with truly professiol doctors who I often describe as being scientists rather than simply being a part of the medical industry, ""machine,"" so to speak. The pediatrician for my children is a remarkable man who is often willing to spend thirty minutes with each of my children making sure that they have no troubles and beyond that even longer discussing any concerns I have about my children's health. When one of my children needed a fairly minor surgery I was just overwhelmed by the doctor he recommended for it. He was intelligent, concerned, professiol, and not rushed. He was clearly very busy, but he was willing and able to discuss all of my concerns. All things considered, the majority of doctors are not professiols. The professiols are few and far between and rarely encountered in a random selection of doctors."
0.720000	My doctor augmented my lexapro prescription with wellbutrin, and her knowledge to do that was very thorough in my opinion.
0.920000	I have known my physician as a friend before he became my doctor. He was also a work associate before, so I know the type of doctor he is to other people, and I know for a fact he is good and cares about his patinets.
0.800000	most doctors that I've had has had the patients best interest in mind. Sometimes they may not seem too warm or attentive but most of the time they are in my experience. They make sure to go over everything thoroughly so they don't miss any symptoms I might be having and that I understand fully the information that they need to tell me.
1.000000	I fully trust my primary care MD because we have a longtime patient/Dr relationship.  She is fully aligned with my health outcome goals and supports me toward those.
0.680000	While my doctor can sometimes seem a bit rushed and hurried to get out of the room I do trust him.  Even though he goes through the options a bit fast he does let me know all the options I have.  I know he has my best interest in mind. 
0.800000	She works with me on a care plan whereas most physicians that I've ever seen in the past just assume they know whats best for you and you don't get a say in the matter.
0.640000	I find that doctors are quick to prescribe medication for symptoms that can be maged otherwise.  I feel it's unnecessary in some cases.  When I have spoken to my doctor about altertive or tural medicine, she is quick to deny it's efficacy, but when I use it, it works.  There have also been times I had to self diagnos because my doctors weren't thoroughly looking into my symptoms.
0.960000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Doctors are very educated about health and they know much more than i do about whats going on inside of me, so if i am told by my doctor that  i need to take certain meds or do a certain thing to fix a problem i am having, i will absolutely do it.
0.560000	In general, I am a skeptical person so probably likely to questions all things, so it seems like I am not completely trusting. Also, I don't feel like the doctor listens carefully to what I am saying, so I am hesitant to put complete in the doctor.  I don't think the doctor will intentiolly lead me in a wrong direction but maybe not the best option for me. 
0.760000	Doctors that I have dealt with have been upfront with me and told me what is wrong and what I should do about it. Beating around the bush is very uncommon.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is our family doctor and she always explain my condition to me and refer me to a specialty when I need one,she take good care of me and my whole family.  
0.840000	Well if anyone knows me better than myself it would be my doctor hopefully so I yeah I have trust in my doctor
0.760000	Doctors in general do a great job. I have run into some that haven't and it makes me realize that I need to be careful with the doctor I visit. Most doctors are very considerate and will provide info, but some are more interested in seeing as many patients as possible.
0.880000	I have been seeing her for many years and she has never given me reason not to trust her. She is kind and I really look forward to seeing and speaking with her. I feel that she cares about me persolly, and I am not just a number. 
0.800000	They have always explained why they are going to use a certain kind of treatment and why it's best for me. I've never gotten the impression that they were out for their own gain. I have always been taken care of and wouldn't look to switch any time soon.
0.440000	Sometimes doctors assume I don't do or don't know (fill in blank) or they think of me in terms of a stereotypical type of person who is my age and gender. I like to know just about all the details and even the recent research done on whatever is bothering me, so it's lucky I don't have a condition. I trust myself more than a doctor, in general. They can't know more about me than I do.   
1.000000	My primary care physician is a really responsible and nice person. Actually, the doctors I saw in general are responsible and nice. Based on how they treated me every time, very professiol and knowledgeable; how they spent time explaining things to me, answering my questions with great patience, even stupid questions sometimes. If I have problems with meds or my symptoms, I can call their offices and get quick responses. I will get a phone call reminding me about my upcoming treatments and appointments. I feel that I can completely trust them to take care of my health.
0.640000	I regularly trust doctors but i recognize that they sometimes might be biased towards recommending certain medicaments. I don't really pay attention to that though.
0.600000	I have a neutral opinion. The only time I questioned the doctor's diagnosis was when I still went to a pediatrician, and they thought I had a bacteria infection. It turned out when the sickness came back, it was actually full blown bronchitis. 
0.680000	i trust my doctor knowing that he/she had medical training and education and i don't 
1.000000	I trust my dr because after not going to one in 14 years, I filly found one and she makes me feel safe and respected. 
0.400000	One thing for instance, I just started seeing a new PCP due to insurance changing over,  I have not been impressed by my first visit, hoping it gets better, but like receiving a blood test in the mail stated all was negative and clearly a level of Vitamin D was very low, the test was highlighted in Bold, and labeled Low, but it was stamp signed stating all normal.,  
0.440000	I think most doctors have good intentions but they are very overworked . . .  to the point where it's very difficult for them to do their jobs well.
0.800000	Most doctors are businessmen first and doctors second, meaning that medical practice has transitioned from a profession to a crass, me-first money making operation. Most of the docs I know care about caring, and serving the best interests of their patients; but I have to acknowledge that for more than a few docs, money matters a lot.
0.680000	My doctor has a certain style which inspires confidence.  I think this comes mostly from his actions resulting from many years of experience.  There's never a sense that he's following a mechanical flow chart, or reading from a textbook. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician, because she remember all my health history, and she is very good. 
0.760000	If I didn't trust the doctor and did not believe in his or her abilities and commitment to patients, I wouldn't be seeing this doctor. The standard of care for pretty much any injury or illness is established by governing medical bodies based on scientific evidence. With some small variation pretty much every doctor will prescribe the same treatment under the same medical circumstances. If I trust modern medicine there is no grounds for distrusting the care my doctor suggests. Which doctor I go to is mainly a matter of my convenience and my persol perceptions.
0.280000	"I feel like everyone is in a hurry and the perception / feelings is no one really cares. Myself and everyone else is just a number out of billions. I feel like I am just a process and not a person. Dr's tend to see all of their patience day to day, hour to hour, week to week for the purpose of the paycheck and the fincial gains. It has nothing to do with health care or the needs and wants of a persons healthcare, it is all about money and big money at that. Healthcare and everyone involved in the healthcare industry is all about the ""Market"" of making money. "
0.720000	I have never been treated wrong by him.
0.640000	He comes into the room, asks me a couple of generic questions, and tries to get out of there in a hurry because he has other patients to deal with. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a means to his golf course membership. 
0.400000	I do not trust my doctor, because it feels like my doctor doesn't trust me when I'm explaining what is wrong with me. It feels like he rushes our appointment instead of taking the time to hear me out.
0.920000	I do not have a primary care physician and avoid seeing doctors when at all possible. However, I do see a clinical psychologist at least weekly, and I trust her completely. She has been working with me for several years now, has been very helpful, and always seems to have her patients' interest first. She goes out of her way to be kind and respect who I am as a person. As for doctors in general, my experiences have been very mixed - some very caring and helpful, others very cold, disrespectful, and arrogant. With that being the case, when I do have to resort to seeing a doctor, I try to keep an open mind, but I also find that I try to gather as much pertinent information as possible before I go to an appointment, communicate the problem clearly (and ONLY the current problem, no extraneous information), and let them know what has worked for me in the past if I've had this issue before. I find it difficult to trust doctors who seem to have their own agenda - for instance, ones who insist on prescribing medications that I know are not really effective for me, or ones who treat every patient as though they're a drug addict (and there are a LOT of these doctors in our area).
0.880000	He is the most well known and highly recommended doctor in my area. He is always extremely thorough and compassiote
0.760000	I trust those medical people that I'm close to. They believe that their approach is correct, and I respect this. However, I sometimes have my own views,.. often, in fact. However, as stated, my trust is generally high.
0.640000	I like and trust my doctor, I've been a patient of his for several years. I trust his judgement and diagnosis although I also know sometimes doctors are just guessing. 
0.760000	I trust my physician because I believe they have no reason to lie to me about my health. They are paid professiols and they get paid to inform me about my health.
0.800000	I trust the doctor because has has a long career and has been through many experiences in his practice.  He has not been sued for malpractice and he is still in business. In our relationship, he has not led me wrong and has always given helpful advise.
0.800000	I really trust my doctor because I have been with her for a long time and she has been with us for many health situations. I have a lot of friends who go to her as well, and they have nothing but good thigns to say. I feel like she really listens to us and knows her stuff.
0.720000	I wouldn't say that I have complete trust. They do what they can do. For anything that is beyond their scope of expertise, they send you to a specialist.
0.840000	My doctor is very persoble and understanding when I am having problems struggling with depression and anxiety. When I have needed extra help, she has recommended other helpful resources for me to take advantage of, and when I've needed medication changes, she has helped me set up appointments with a psychiatrist.
0.400000	I was feeling a lot of pain and other symptoms. I went to my primary doctor and she accused me of exaggerating. She also said that she is not some clinic to get pain pills from because she said I always complain about body pains and it is unlikely someone under 30 can be in so much pain. She still took my blood for sampling and as usual, it showed I had a high white blood cell count. She said I haven't been eating right and she gave me antibiotics. I went for a second opinion and was diagnosed with 2 autoimmune diseases that apparently would have been easy to spot if the other doctor listened closely to everything I kept telling her every time I went in so she could have gotten the proper tests.
0.840000	I feel a primary care physician or doctor is trained and highly skilled in their area of expertise. I respect this, although I am cautious and will consult a second opinion if I think it is needed.
0.600000	"What I would say is I trust science and how it develops information, which can inform decisions. Through persol experience in seeing how doctors have misdiagnosed my family members and in hearing numerous stories of similar situations from family and friends, I would say doctors often don't care about good outcomes for their patients as much as they should. They can seem uninterested, cold, and have little involvement in the actual ""caring"" part of health care. That being said, I know there are many good doctors who do care, though many may be overworked and somewhat desensitized. "
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor because she attentively listen to what I have to say, and is willing to provide me with the latest treatments and how she arrived at her decision about any treatment that she feels will benefit me. I like that we engage in a dialogue that is therapeutic from both perspective. I feel that my doctor is being honest with me based on her abilities as a doctor
1.000000	My doctor is up-to-date on newest medical treatments and experimental data. She is forthright in talking with me, asks me a lot of questions, and explains everything so I can understand what she is saying. She has a sense of humor. She is thorough in her record keeping, follow-up with me, and treats me as an individual, not a number. She's young, bright, and persoble.
0.800000	The doctors I've dealt with have all been upfront and straightforward with me about whatever condition I've had. They've never deceived me and I've had no reason to distrust them or the advice they've given.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he really cares about my health and well being. He is very patient, and informative. 
0.720000	i trust my physician because they Treating me with care and concernâ and âTaking your problems seriously.
0.760000	I trust my doctor a greater deal. She has always provided with a ton information for all treatments. When I call with questions she is always very happy to help or research information for me.
0.640000	I'm the kind of person that likes to verify everything myself. It turns out my doctor has been right most of the time. A couple of times he's been wrong. But hey, nobody's perfect, which is why it's important to verify.
1.000000	First of all I am generally healthy and go to the doctor twice a year for check ups and blood work evaluations. My doctor is very observant of my physical condition and the medication I take. He is approachable, invites questions, gives you good suggestions for improving your health. I trust my doctor as he has referred me to specialists when he is in doubt. these specialists have always been excellent. I am so fortute to have a great doctor who is also a people person and is not going to treat you for something in a field where he is not an expert.
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general. However, since I am not an expert in the field of medicine, there are times when I feel really sick and have to consult a doctor. In such situations, I try my best to ask all possible questions that I have about my illness and the course of action suggested by the doctor. Only if I am completely satisfied with the answers will I follow the advise given by the doctor. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, then I will either seek a second opinion (if I am very sick) or treat myself with home remedies.
0.600000	For myself, I go to Planned Parenthood for all my medical needs, so the person who sees me for my medical needs always changes; I never know who I will get. Some practitioners seem quite trusting, while other can't wait to end their day. I think most give good advice, but I always like to double check when it's something very, very important.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I feel that he cares about me and wants to help me
0.800000	I've gone to my PCP since I was a child, we have a really good relationship. 
0.480000	I find that my PCP is quite busy, and my time with him is limited.   I also find that the information he (and other PCP(s) I have dealt with) offers is not complete, and that I better understand medical issue(s) by conducting additiol research on my own, and also seeking specialist referral(s) and appropriate testing. 
1.000000	He has helped me in the past in dealing with health issues and he acts more like a friend in our appointments rather than someone just trying to force something and being very indifferent when it comes to our conversations. He actually speaks and you can feel his concern and his understanding. He knows how to be a friend or at least act friendly.
0.960000	From the past experiences I have had with my doctor, the care/medicines he has prescribed me has always helped. Also my doctor makes sure & give me the option to choose the medication instead of forcing it on me.
0.360000	"I distrust most of the medical community in general because they assume that they know more than their success rate would corroborate. Their procedures and treatments are more of an attack on the body, hence the 'negative side-effects"". They rely almost entirely upon laboratory ""medications"", while scoffing at most tural treatments. They're drug pimps for the pharmaceutical industry. Most pharmaceuticals are the result of back-engineering things found in ture that are free. However, you can't have a trillion dollar industry informing people that they can use tural altertives at a small fraction of the cost (if not freely) and that the altertives don't cause sty side-effects. The medical community is great for dealing with body parts, but they're failing miserably when it comes to actually curing diseases. They focus more on making the patient FEEL better while they still have the underlying condition."
0.960000	My primary care physician is a very nice young woman and I have been to her several times over the past years.  She has always told me what is necessary and I have never sensed any dishonesty in speaking with her.  She has told me the truth about everything I have asked about. She also listens to what I told her I thought was the problem.  She has agreed with me on many occasions. She has referred me to another physician when she thought it was beyond her scope.  I have asked for prescriptions that I felt would be necessary for me and she has complied and agreed with me.  She is young and I feel she has the most current knowledge possible.  I have never looked at her as inexperienced.  She has always presented herself very professiol and she presents herself as very knowledgeable.  In conversations with her, she IS actually knowledgeable. 
0.840000	I have been going to the same doctor for a good number of years.  He is always willing to sit and discuss with me and explain to be anything I am unsure of.
0.760000	Sometimes I suspect if the doctor is looking for his own benefit rather than the patient's benefit, as it happens a lot. for example, advising for a surgery while it is not necessary or a very little benefit will result out of it.
0.760000	My doctor almost always explains everything she says in great detail, something which I very much appreciate. If she cannot do that, she will show me on the computer or from a book what she is talking about. So, any lack of trust I have is just myself being paranoid.
0.680000	I primarily trust my primary doctor. She is super nice and always answers all of my questions thoroughly and takes time to explain whats going on. That builds the trust every time I see her.
0.720000	Because we think they are knowledgeable and we believe in them and put our trust in them and expect them to provide us with proper guidece
0.880000	I'm very knowledgeable about health, but I also don't have md behind my me.  I find that being able to colloborate with a doctor works better for me and my health goals.  I have more faith and trust in a doctor who I mesh very well with and can have dialogue with.
0.760000	ive know my doctor for years, have had him for maybe 8 years if my life, he has always given me advice and the best of care.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician as she takes the time to listen to all my concerns and gave me the proper advise which so far has been positive. She will tell me the pros and cons of the medication before prescribing it. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I find him to be credible, well educated, and trustworthy.  He provides attention and familiarity with the issues that have faced me in the past, and face me currently.  Additiolly, he is well reputed in the medical community and has to my knowledge provided sound treatment and service to me. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he usually thoroughly explains everything to me, and is able to answer any questions that I may have. He also explains pros and cons for treatments and helps me to choose what is best for me.
0.680000	She  has always been  great .. answers any question I may have and askes question s I have never thought of.
0.920000	I trust him because he has open communication and when I ask questions I get honest responses as well as way to be even more health and get better
0.840000	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for a long time. He always explains things to me in detail. He doesn't rush, or ignore my questions.
0.520000	I feel like now days, doctors are in a rush to get patients out of the office, and not so interested in what is going on with the patient, only what they think or the easiest way to get the patient to leave.
0.840000	I generally trust my doctor because they have always led me in the right direction and provided me with the best information or options in respect to my situation. I still like to do my own research as to things they say or recommend to me, but I generally trust their initial assessments. I think most doctors do really care about their patients needs instead of what is just convenient for them.
0.680000	He is an expert.  He has practical experience.  He seems like a good person.
0.720000	I do trust my primary care physician because he is really care about his patients with heart, perhaps he has aged with a happy family. I never seen any patients is not satisfied with his services. He also has a lot of nice staffs at his clinic office. He always clearly explains and give the hard copy of your heath notes if you have any concerns.  
0.520000	I distrust physician because I am completely dependent on them to do the right thing or properly inform my about available or possible options
0.600000	The major issues I've experienced with my health are things that are not easily diagnosed and sometimes doctors still don't think it even exists. So I'm brushed off quite a bit and that makes me wary of trusting a doctor.
0.680000	I usually ask what I already know so there is nothing much to discuss.
0.800000	Typically when I see a doctor, they are a medical resident. I actually feel more confident in this situation because I know that if there is any doubt, they will seek more information through their attending. I would say I usually trust the doctors I see, but I do like to keep myself informed by other means as well, just in case.
0.640000	I trust my current physician. I just recently had a problem and my new doctor actually did all they could to find the problem. All of my searching and information I had from myself they ordered all those tests and asked all the right stuff that matched up so I trust them now.
0.800000	My PCP has always been nice and caring.  I don't have a reason to not trust him or doubt him.  Everything has always worked out well.
0.600000	i have been with him for the longest time and i have never have any issues that i might have to second gues. if i did i usually ask him right then and there 
1.000000	My doctor is trustful. My doctor does what is best for his patients.
0.760000	My doctor takes the time to explain things fully and answer any questions I have. He is receptive to what I think and asks many questions to get a full gauge of what is going on with me every time I see him.
0.680000	I trust that they understand what they're talking about. However, I sometimes wonder if the prescriptions and procedures are given out to make them the most money
0.480000	I think they sometimes can make mistakes as any person and it's not good to rely on just one person.
1.000000	each time i go to the doctor, she always explains things clearly. She gives me all the options I have to cure what ails me. If she does not know an answer she is not afraid to say it either. So I know she won't just make something up.
0.440000	I think my doctor cares more about making a profit than my well-being. He will talk about my condition and answer questions, but anything that doesn't involve pharmaceutical drugs, he shuts down as bogus. I don't believe that. I don't feel he is very thorough and I really only go to the doctor if absolutely necessary. 
0.720000	"I do not have ""complete trust"" in any human being as any person can make a mistake. I tend to trust my Physician because based upon experience this person has proven to be trustworthy and knowledgeable. Ultimately my health decisions are mine to make guided by the professional knowledge of a trusted Physician."
0.920000	I have been going to my doctor for about 30 years.  He is also a personal friend of my husbands.  At the same time, he is a very conscientious and caring doctor so I trust that he has my best interest at heart.  He is also passionate about his profession and has been in practice for a long time so I am sure he is very knowledgeable.
0.800000	The reason I trust my doctor it is because I have known him for a long time and is a very professional and caring person. He loves what he does.
0.720000	My doctor is a confident and intelligent person whom I respect. He is willing to here my thought s and opinions on my own health and but as I have cultivated a reputation of years with the man, I know that I can trust in his expertise. 
0.720000	I feel like I can mostly trust my physician. I have been seeing them for a while and I feel like he answers my questions efficiently and makes sure to go over what he prescribes for me
0.600000	My visits often feels hurried and like there's not enough time for a thorough consideration of my health issues. She seems completely competent, but I don't think enough time is given for her to really be very thorough.
0.720000	Doctors in general are trustworthy because they have a career to uphold. If they were to mess around with you, they could lose their license, or be subject to a huge lawsuit. It's important that doctors uphold the hippocratic oath, or else they won't be around long. You have to trust that you wouldn't be an unlucky few who are are exposed to a terrible doctor. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes time to listen to my problems and examines me thoroughly. He is also smart and empathetic.
0.920000	I've had no reason to not trust him. He always explains things well to me. He doesn't do unnecessary tests and doesn't seem interest d in overbilling for things, just gets right to the point and gets me out of there. 
0.800000	My doctor has always shown me great care.
0.760000	This person seems to be pretty objective in their decisions. I don't see them as the kind of doctor to recommend a lot of unnecessary tests. They mostly seem to want what is good for me.
0.720000	I'm a person who needs a lot of information and completely capable of understanding complex medical research. If I think they are hedging or not giving me all the options, I'll find another doctor. If they explain and give me detailed information I trust them.
0.600000	"I disagree with a lot of what is taught in ""conventional"" medicine and I do not believe doctors are taught everything they should be taught and are left ""ignorant"" in regard to a lot of important information. Most doctors are trained to be ""pill dispensers"" and are not trained to discover the root cause of most illness. I don't blame doctors as much as I blame the ""establishment"" for the way they teach medicine and put so much emphasis on getting as many patients in and out as possible and maximizing profit."
1.000000	I had the same doctor growing up and for a few years into adulthood. When I became a nurse I started noticing that my doctor seemed to just want to get out of the room and didn't really seem to care much. I switched doctors several times before finding the one I am currently a patient of and he is amazing. He truly cares and takes time with each patient to provide the best care possible.
0.680000	I think that they listen to me and try to understand me. But sometimes I question the treatment they suggest. I don't know if it is the only one, best one or the most convenient for the medical practice one. I want to trust them, but I do have to watch out for myself too.
0.640000	Sometimes I feel like doctors are so pressed for time they are just trying to get out of the room. Also, I worry about their relationships to insurance and drug companies that might influence their course of treatment. I don't think they wish to do harm, they are just conflicted.
0.800000	I trust doctors because they're well-trained and well-intentioned. However, like in many professions, skill level varies with experience and with the doctor in general. Also, there are always more and more cutting edge treatments and statistical evidence being released that often changes things significantly. On top of this, the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and doctors does cause some concern. So a patient should always do due diligence when it comes to any serious procedure, condition, or medication. That being said, the doctor is almost always going to improve your situation and make you aware of what your health circumstances are.
0.480000	I don't have complete trust in my doctor. He is smart and he cares, but he's been wrong too many times and I've had to look elsewhere for answers. I've figured out things on my own that he couldn't after several visits.
0.720000	I don't currently have a PCP, but in general I trust doctors a little but not totally. I think that to some degree big pharma makes it hard for them to be totally unbiased in their decisions. So I think that have my interest in mind, but I also like to do my own research to back up what I am told.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to me. She gives me all the options needed for different treatments and health remedies. She asks me before doing things instead of just telling me they are what I need to do
0.560000	The practice is very busy and he is late all the time. He shuffles a lot of things off to nurses. He seems to know his stuff, but he rushes through it often. It can also take a long time to get an appt or a refill.
0.840000	I have complete trust in my family physician.
0.520000	Doctors are human. They have their own interests like everyone else. So there is going to be bias in there decisions.
0.200000	Doctors and arrogant and a high percentage of them are sociopaths. They represent the pharmaceutical industry and they will deny their rx drug prescriptions caused anyone any harm. Doctors are unethical and dangerous as they put their ego and money ahead of the public's best interest. I stay away from them and hate most I have ever had the misfortune to come in contact with.  The only times I have gotten better from anything is when i have avoided or stopped going to allopathic doctors. 
0.600000	I have no doc at the moment.  In general I trust no one so everything is approached with skepticism
0.480000	Dr's are people like everyone else, and people will always do what is best for them. Maybe they are in a bad mood and want to leave maybe they are getting kickbacks for prescribing a certain drug/treatment. My dr has tried to keep me on a medication that there was no real reason for me to be on, when I pressed her on why she wanted me to take it she could really give me a good reason beyond she said so. 
0.880000	I explained this in the other answer. They really answer my questions in detail. I also research my questions and have access to my medical records online. I also get printed information on my conditions and steps to take when I leave the doctor.
0.880000	"He goes through each option, detail by detail, explains the pros and cons, prices and impact on my health. He often says ""Full disclosure, I benefit from people being RX'd this drug."" If I have suggestions from research, he takes those into consideration and allows me to participate in my care."
1.000000	down to earth, admits when he doesnt know something, is more then helpful and up front
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary doctor for over a decade. She is always willing to listen to my concerns, sets aside enough time to answer any questions I have, and is always willing to listen to any input I want to offer & make any needed modifications to any needed treatment accordingly. I trust her primarily because she has demonstrated, over a number of years, that she is trustworthy.
0.440000	Primary care physician might not have enough knowledge to make an informed decision. The doctor might not be up to date with the latest treatments.
0.840000	He is a smart guy. Been around for many years. 
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician because he treats me kindly.
0.800000	my doctor has always given me proper information and prescriptions to make me feel better and each time his remedies have worked for me
0.320000	I recently had a doctor inject me with a different medication than what I normally take, without ever informing me of this or obtaining my consent. It was a generic form of the medication, which I understand is apparently legal to do. I however find it extremely and highly unethical. I have switched doctors as of today. 
0.560000	They are human just like the rest of us. My doctor has his own best interests at heart when it comes right down to it. I'm sure that he tries his best to help me, but if my needs conflicted with his I'm sure he would take care of himself first. Nothing against him in particular; I just feel that is how everyone would act. 
0.600000	They don't really seem interested in what I had to say about my body and the side effects of the drugs i'm often prescribed. They sound like a shill trying to get me on many different medications
0.600000	I only get 10-15 minutes with my physician. She's overworked, I don't think doctors have the time to fully explain everything to each patient.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they are very friendly, understanding, caring and helpful. They always make me feel comfortable asking questions and such. They also always keep my best interest in mind, and making sure I am comfortable with everything before proceeding.
0.800000	He's been my doctor for years I know him outside of his work. I trust what he says but sometimes I don't want to follow his advice.
1.000000	In regard to doctors in general, I feel that most put people first and are there because they generally care about people. I don't believe any doctor will intentionally mislead a patient, because I don't think any of them want to face the repercussions from doing so. Ultimately, if they don't treat their patients right, they won't be practicing much longer.
0.960000	These people have gone to years and years of schooling to get into their position. They just want o do what's best for the patient and don't want to risk their job for anything.
0.760000	I'm with tricare. The doctors there aren't paid to push any specific brand of drugs. They have a lot of expertise in their field and see a lot of patients on a daily basis so their opinion carries a lot of weight. They aren't restricted by budget so much as other practices so they're more likely to recommend tests that other practices may have avoided.
0.720000	While I do trust my doctor, I still seek out additional information when I feel it necessary.  My doctor has never violated my trust.  I still feel like you can't be too careful, because everyone has bad days and could miss something.
0.800000	I really like my PCP. She's super nice and understanding. She explains everything really well and makes sure to focus on me while I'm there. She always asks how I'm doing and about non medical aspects of my life. I feel like she cares.
0.800000	My primary care physician takes his time trying to find out what is wrong with me. He doesn't jump to a conclusion or pass me off as a customer. There have been a couple of situations that, I could see, kind of stumped him in diagnosing the cause. That made me feel more at ease then him coming to a decision/conclusion quickly. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician. He has never been wrong about any medical condition I have ever had. He always explains everything that he feels may be complicated to understand. He always answers all of my questions very thoroughly.
0.440000	I think I can trust any medical guys that I come in counter with, I haven't met any quacks yet In my life time.
0.800000	My doctor has never gave me a reason not to trust her. She is kind and caring and upfront and honest. 
0.680000	"my doctor does not mention/discuss any real ""natural"" ways to help any kind of  medical issue I might have so I do my own research because I cannot trust that the dr. will give me any such information, instead just wanting to prescribe medications when it may possibly not be needed."
0.480000	I don't trust medical professionals because sometimes they may be sponsored by a drug manufacturer, and they just perform medical services to promote their sponsors. Really don't trust doctors.
0.800000	I have never had reason not to trust a doctor. This could be because I have always had pretty good health but event he small issues i have had were taken care of without problems or concerns.
0.480000	since I'm the only one on this planet that knows me the best, I make sure to research every possible item no matter how trustworthy, skilled or experience the health professional is. people are not perfect and they do make mistakes. 
0.720000	I do trust my doctor but you can never be too careful because at the end of the day with all the good intentions in the world if something goes wrong I'm the one it'll effect, I have to live with it. So I do trust my doctor but at the end of the day I'm responsible for taking care of myself. I think doctors in general are well intentioned and do the best they can in general.
0.840000	I just have always liked them and felt right with them. They are always good to me
0.920000	My doctor is through and never makes us feel rushed. We feel like we are the only one there. They watch our medications to warn us of a conflict. They tell us all of the side effects.
0.560000	My doctor is relatively young, but I feel like he has grown over the 5 or so years I've seen him. Professional growth is a good sign that he is at least trying. I don't trust him completely because I live in an area that the best professionals tend to avoid. I assume he is a bit of a reject. Also, how can you trust any doctor when most of them spend all of 6 minutes diagnosing you?
1.000000	I trust my primary car physician because he has been my doctor since I was born. 
0.920000	I have been with my doctor since I was 18 years old. He has never done unneeded testing, is quick to personally call me when I have questions instead of having a nurse do it. I had a medical scare in November, and he actually came to my house when my blood pressure sky rocketed to wait with me while my husband drove home. 
0.680000	If he can help me get better 
0.760000	I don't see a reason not to trust them.
0.760000	sometimes i feel like my doctor prescribes medicine unnecessarily just to pacify me. but he does ask a lot of questions and try to be as thorough as possible and refers me to a specialist when he's unsure of my condition.
0.560000	It makes me very uncomfortable that doctors can receive 'kickback' payments from drug manufacturers to recommend their products.
0.440000	The doctor will give you a treatment option that they are familiar with and usually that is not all the options that are available. Insurance companies also influence doctors and the type of treatments they cover. Research the subject on your own, in my opinion.
1.000000	I have the most amazing doctor who is friendly and open to anything you have to say. He is very willing to listen when you are talking. He has great values and will give you his honest opinion. I love how good his bed side manner is. He makes you feel comfortable as soon as he walks in the room.
0.760000	"I trust him because he seems genuine in what he says and seems like he truly cares about my wellbeing. However, I can't say that I trust him ""completely"" because I have a bit of distrust in medical professionals and the healthcare industry in general."
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because she's been there for me for the last decade. I've gone to her whenever I had issues, major or minor. I've built a relationship with her. That always helps. If I go to a new doctor, I don't think I will have that same feeling.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because my whole family has been going to her for years. I've known her since I was a little kid and now i'm 35. She knows everything about me and she knows how to talk to me.
0.720000	I usually trust my physician because they have no reason to lie to me.  They go based off of current medical information.  Sometimes I get frustrated when I know I need an antibiotic to help me but they refuse or dance around the issue.
0.800000	I have been going to the same doctor since I was born and now my children go to the same one. She has always explained things clearly and given options and tried to do her best for us. 
1.000000	My doctor takes her time with me and I never feel rushed. She will ask about me and give me a chance to ask questions. She engages in real life examples and will put things in plain terms.
0.760000	I do not trust them because they will just prescribe you with over the counter drugs that will end up killing the human body one day.
0.720000	I feel like I have trust in my primary care physician. I feel like they have my best interests in mind and they try to solve any problem that I come to them for. They are really good at what they do.
0.560000	I feel that my medical care providers are very well educated and i can tell, I think they have every motivation to to open and fair and honest with me because they have years of experience and they would not be in the position if they were not adequately helping patients
0.600000	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. But sometimes doctors make choices based on insurance issues, drug company promotion, and other things that are not always good for my general well being.
0.560000	Doctors now a days seem pre-occupied and kind just go through the motions of their job.   I am not sure my best interest is their main concern
0.280000	Most of the time, when I go visit my doctor, she is so busy that she spends a maximum of five minutes with me, looking at her clipboard, asking generic questions and then rushes out. I feel like I am not allowed to ask her questions in the off chance that I am inconveniencing her and her busy day. Makes me not really trust doctors and someimtes i feel like I am prescribed something for the sake of pharma companies tryign to seel patients drugs when we actually don't need them. I honestly dont like to be highly medicated but at times, it looks like docs are looking out for their own salaries and compensations at times. like this. 
0.840000	I work with my doctor and I really like him. He is very good at listening and let me be apart of my treatment plan. 
1.000000	I've been with my doctor a long time and he never sugarcoats anything he tells me. He is always honest about whatever aspect of my life is going to kill me. He's good.
0.760000	I trust him, but the things I'll take a neutral position on are things like pharmaceutical drugs. I don't like taking them and I'll always do my own research to see if there are other things I can do before trying them. If there isn't, I'll grudgingly take them.
0.800000	I don't have any complex medical conditions so anything the doctor tells me I have no real reason to doubt. I don't see any ill effects from whatever I have been told by my primary doctor.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because it is their job and they are supposed to be knowledgeable on the subject. They have tons of training and education and should be prepared. 
0.720000	I have established a relationship with my doctor over a few years, and find his advice to be pretty trustworthy for the most part. If I ask about other options, he is glad to take the time to talk to me. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I believe he has my best interests in mind. I don't feel like I'm being taken advantage of or being talked down to. I think that everything is done with the patient's best interests in mind.
0.760000	I've been seeing him for +10 years. He's extremely thorough. I could complain about a slight ache and he'd order a whole x-ray just to be sure nothing else is going on. He's very competent and has listened to me in the past and talked to me
1.000000	I have been with my physician almost my entire life.  He has on more than one occasion diagnosed me with something that the hospital did not.  Everyone in my town looks up to this man as a talented diagnostician.  If I need a note, he never objects, he always helps me out of things if I need it.  I even have his cell phone if there is an emergency, and he has neglected to charge me a few times when I have been going through financial hardships.  He cares deeply about all his patients and it really shows.
0.800000	My doctor has little reason to lie to me, so I can trust in them to provide me with the proper care. I do question medications when I can, as I know that doctors receive kickbacks and things like that from companies. I try to make sure to use holistic methods when I can. Medications can be dangerous and harmful if you become addicted to them. I prefer to use natural methods when I can, so that I can avoid anything unnecessary.
0.360000	The few times I have seen her, she seems to hyper-focus on ONE issue, and almost overdoes it. She tries to quickly get me out of her office after dealing with that ONE issue only, even if I ave 2 or 3 medical issues that need to be dealt with. To get the appropriate care, I would need to go to separate visits for all my individual issues and needs.
0.760000	My urologist is a little young, so it was kind of scary trusting him with my goods. But he showed confidence in himself and it made me feel confident in him. 
0.800000	I have noticed when I am more open and honest with them then in turn it allows them to understand my situation better and they will be more honest and willing to help me because I am not trying to hide anything as well as the relationship I develop with them I can sense they want to help me. 
0.600000	he is an okay physician. i dont visit him much but when i do, he does his job and asks me questions. he gives me prescriptions
0.640000	Waiting around for an hour and more in order to talk with a guy for a few minutes annoys me.  I know they're busy, but I hate feeling rushed.  I feel like just another patient file/number.
0.800000	I trust them because they have a lot more knowledge about medical issues than I do. I think most if not all got into the profession to help people, and I dont think they would risk their reputations to harm me. 
0.640000	the truth I do not distrust any doctor if they are in the position they are because something they did well I do not think they have failed
0.240000	I've had so many doctors that simply do not care about their patients, do not explain risks in procedures or medications. The latest doctor I had gave me extremely powerful drugs without explaining their side effects and effectively crippled me (ruined the tendons in my legs).
0.600000	I am pretty neutral in general to how a doctor acts or any motivations I am not seeing. Mostly, I just go when I need to. Get seen and checked on. Told what they think is wrong and then get the medication. If it works great. If it does not then back I go to see what could be the issue. 
0.800000	My primary care physician has always behaved very professionally with me. He is open to answering my questions and will explain things to me when necessary. I know he has had years of schooling and he is very knowledgeable.
0.520000	Some doctors seem more interested in selling extra products that I really don't need..Seems they just want the extra income.
0.760000	I have had this doctor for a long time.  She always takes time with me.  She wants what will be the best option for me.  I never feel rushed when I have an appointment.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor because she does a thorough check with me when I see her for daily check ups. She is always very patient and kind despite how mean some patients can be. She also suggests where I can run tests that won't cost me money. There's never been an incident where I lost my trust in her.
0.800000	I trust my doctor.  He has never lied to me, or seemed to push me in any direction.  He gives me the information that i need, and his opinion, and leaves the decisions up to me.
0.920000	My doctor has never been wrong. She has always been honest with me, and she knows when I am not taking my medications like I should. She gets me the results of my blood test back in short order, and changes my prescriptions if I feel they are not working.
0.800000	I have been with this group for some time now and I feel like they have alway took good care of me so I think I can trust what they are saying and doing for me and I have no reserves
0.880000	My primary care doctor has been helpful to me throughout my life and has always made a point to make sure that I am getting better. 
0.760000	Because he can attend all the patient it would be very good and nice of it.Great so we can trust physician and it will be very good
0.840000	My primary care physician listens to my questions and concerns, explains her thought process about diagnosis, and works with me to resolve any lingering health issues (fortunately, I'm relatively healthy). She also has evening and weekend hours, so I appreciate her willingness to work around patients' schedules.
0.720000	I have to trust that my doctor is going to say and do what is in my best interests. I want to know exactly what can be and needs to be done in order to get or stay healthy. I want to be confident that my doctor is going to do the things that they have sworn to do as a medical professional, and thinking that they may not be doing so is too upsetting to even consider. 
0.760000	My doctor takes the time to get to know me and my life. He will allow my to voice and problems or questions I have about my health. I would like to think that my doctor actually cares about me, because that is the impression I get. 
0.720000	The most obvious things that have changed the perception of medicine over these last forty years include high profile cases of physician fraud, drug abuse, drug pushing, malfeasance, gross malpractice, even murder.   What in the past was often hushed up, or discounted as highly unusual, have now become grist for the media mill.  To say that physiciansâ images have been tarnished by these instances would be an understatement.
0.760000	being inj good health just doesn't need a lot of advice from a dr. treatments are a few pills a day and i feel fine
0.720000	I trust my doctors in general. I don't think there is any reason for a doctor to lie to me or try and deceive me. They may not always be the most attentive or take the most time to get to know what's wrong, but I don't think they're ever intentionally deceitful or anything like that.
0.520000	I think doctors at times will push what is easiest for them or what they think might be a option that is a little more costly when the risk is not too high. I feel like anything else doctors are out to make money. They may ask you to do unneccesary tests as well at times.
0.760000	Although I have only been seeing my current doctor for 6 months, she caught a health issue that made a difference in my life. I trust her to be thorough and give me the care i need. I feel that I need to be with her longer to fully form my opinion, but so far I trust her and believe she is honest. 
0.520000	I've been going to the same doctor my whole life, and when I was younger it seemed like he knew what he was doing. Now that he's older, it seems like he just wants to get patients out of his office as quickly and as possible. Prescribe some medicine and you're good to go. I like not spending a lot of time in the doctor's office, but it does make me wonder if he actually knows what he's doing.
0.600000	I would prefer that all the information relative to my body be listed and discussed and added to the procedure of what we're going to do with my body.
0.600000	I trust him to an extent, but not fully.  I believe he presents the options that are available to me honestly, but I would not trust him to make medical decisions on my behalf - in an important situation or when facing a problem I would want a second opinion, would want to do some research myself, would want to talk to other people about the situation, etc.  I also think my doctor, like many, is often more rushed for time and more concerned with getting to the next patient than I would like him to be.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has done nothing to lose that trust. He always explains why he recommends things
0.680000	I trust my doctor because this is his job and his expertise. He has a background and knowledge of the subject, so I am really in no place to second guess him. I can ask questions for further explaination or instruction
0.440000	i've had a variety of different primary care physicians and this varies for all of them - but sometimes i do get the sense that they're not being very thorough or diligent and just wanting to see the next patient
0.760000	I trust my doctor because She is someone I have known for a long time and also knows my family.  This person has always had my best intentions and has always helped me to feel better when I was feeling ill.
0.720000	You  choose your doctor and put your faith in them.  If your relationship does not have trust, it will never last. That does not exclude, however, sometimes questioning your doctors decisions.  For that reason, it is important to have a place where you can always get a second opinion. 
0.720000	I trust my physician. She asks a lot of questions and always wants to know what works and what doesn't work for me. She offers medication and solutions.
0.840000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years now and we get along very well; both of us almost look forward to seeing one another. Also, her being a woman like myself helps with our rapport and my general comfort around her.
0.680000	Well I'm more so neutral because I have new physician due to living in a college town while attending.  I've only had to go to her so far for a health check up for insurance purposes.  I had nothing wrong with me so there wasn't any real medical needs present at that time.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I have never been led astray before by him. Every time that I went to my primary care physician, it has been a pleasant experience. I have gotten good medication and health advise. 
0.560000	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. When other doctors had turned down sending me to a specialist for a condition that I had for several years that still had not been addressed, my primary care doctor sent me to a specialist to get it checked out. Furthermore, some small issues that I had been having over the years she took the time to look into to give me a full and proper diagnosis. 
0.560000	I trust doctors for the most part because they have dedicated their lives to helping others. Because of this, I assume that they have my best interests in mind, especially when it comes to my personal health. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have always gotten a working solution for my problems. She asks many detailed questions to make sure she can understand what I am trying to describe and is able to come up with a valid diagnosis. She also provides me with all the information I need to know about my different diagnosis.
0.480000	I have a rare condition and itâs obvious my pcp does not know a whole lot about it. Also I feel like doctors are rushed and donât take the time to do the best care
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he seems to know what he is doing and is always super friendly. It helps that we are friends outside of work too. I feel like I could go to him about anything and he will do what is best for me no matter what it takes.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician as she seems dedicated to providing good care and she is well educated. She does however rush through patient visits and many times downplays my concerns or refers me to other people for the answers I need such as nurses or the pharmacy.    
0.680000	My old doctor I trust because he would be very open and straightforward with me and he would always make sure I am feeling ok. I am not sure about other doctors but hope they would be as good as him. 
1.000000	I love my Doctor and have been seeing him for over 5 years. He is brutally honest with me about everything and is very blunt, which I love. I like to know everything about any diagnosis and he always tells me both the good and bad possibilities. It makes me feel confident in him because he isn't hiding anything.
0.800000	I have known my primary care physician for a long long time now, and every time I get sick or I need help with a medical condition he is there for me, always knows what is going on and always helps me
0.720000	I have been seeing the same family care physician since I was born so I have come to trust him. However, I do feel that every doctor has their own way of thinking that might be different from my way of thinking. 
0.800000	my pcp seems to be very knowledge and takes her time whenever I visit with her. she does not push unnecessary tests and always takes the time to explain answers to any questions I may have. she gives me all the options for certain treatments and gives me her opinion on which is best but always leaves the final option up to be. I feel I can trust her and I have not been disappointed in the past
0.800000	I have never had a major medical issue come up for me.  It's always something minor like a cold, sore throat, or something along those lines.  When I have taken my daughter to the doctor it is always for something minor as well.  Our doctors have always given great advice and the right prescriptions for our needs.  I have no reason not to trust them, but I know I  might feel different if I went to the doctor more often.
0.600000	I know that healthcare is a business and doctors are humans with the same outside stress as everyone else. I know they are sometimes in a rush and don't always make the right decisions.
0.800000	She has always explained things to my satisfaction, both medically and with regard to insurance.  She has helped me and noticed other issues that I didn't really pay attention to, which I really appreciate.  She works hard to help me in any way.
0.680000	I generally trust my primary care physician because I believe that they are generally caring about me and their other patients. Times where I have had issues with my health my primary care physician has been able to effectively diagnose and treat my illnesses and return me to the state that I should be in. I don't necessarily find any reason to distrust my doctor as she has given me no reason to. 
0.600000	My trust is mixed. I've had great experiences with my doctor where they were very caring and compassionate and helpful. There have been other times when it didn't seem likes they cared about me at all. One time they abandoned me in a room so they wouldn't miss their tee time.
0.520000	I mostly trust the physician. But some physicians are work for the salary period. This may be lead to patient's uncomfortable. Physicians has the high responsible for their patient. But some Physicians are not take care about the patient. Their only focus is to improve their financial stability.
0.600000	I would like my doctor to give me more attention when it comes to my concerns about my health. I would like him to explain things to me better so I can get a better understanding of my health,
0.360000	Most doctors, including my PCP, make judgments about me based on how I look, not about my self or health in general. I frequently feel like my concerns are dismissed by doctors, or they treat me as if I am uneducated.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician due to his professional background and the number of testimonies I've heard from others regarding his experience and their visits with him. He made it a point to build up such a reputation, and one should admire that.
0.560000	My doctor can come across as very demeaning and curt.  I think this may be because the only appt times I can make are late in the day and he is tired.  Probably more interested in ending the work day and getting home than dealing with my issues.
0.800000	I have no reason to distrust. He has answered every question I have had about myself and family members without sugar coating anything. He is very upfront and honest.
0.720000	I've had my primary care physician for a long time. I like him and he's never done me wrong in the past. We have a good relationship and I trust that if something were to go wrong he'd give me the best options and treatment. 
0.680000	It seems to be really easy to trust a physician.  I believe this way mainly because a person who has obtained that level of job and status has dedicated their entire life to getting to that point, and why would they want to be untrustworthy and not provide the best care possible if it were to put their job at risk that they have literally dedicated their entire life too.  However, many physicians may abuse their power or even be untrustworthy because they want to take advantage of you and make as much money as possible. 
0.800000	i would trust most doctors. i only go to the gynecologist and optometrist, but they are both great. the only time i wouldnt listen to them is in regards to nutrition. 
0.800000	Thus, far I have had mostly positive experiences with my primary care doctor. Everything I have been prescribed has usually worked well enough.
0.520000	I haven't been going to them for long so the trust isn't completely there yet. I imagine with more time and continued good treatment I will trust them a lot more.
0.720000	My neurologist prescribed me an anti-seizure medication -- I had not had any seizures while I have been taking the medicine. I trust a doctor until I have reason not to.
0.960000	My primary care physician guided me through the hardest point in my life health wise when I had to be hospitalized for a colon condition. His advice was spot on through the entire ordeal and it was possible to make a fast recovery due to him. His guidance is what makes me trust him really no matter what.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough when I see her for visits. She allows me to ask as many questions as I like, and she really listens.
0.400000	I have a medical problem right now that my doctor doesn't seem interested in figuring out. I think they dont really care
0.720000	I have had the same PCP for many years and we have an honest relationship.  I trust him to a certain extent only because he knows me and for the most part my habits and can best prescribe something for me if needed.
0.800000	Doctors go through a lot of training and education to enter their careers, and there's a 100% chance that a doctor who is anywhere close to decent has more knowledge about health than I do.
0.800000	i have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor and he has given me no reason whatsoever to mistrust him. He has taken the time to address any and all concerns that I have had.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. He has always been candid with me and I have always been able to rely on his medical opinion. He is intelligent and has never failed me in the past.
0.600000	I trust my doctors in that they have education and experience in their fields whereas I do not.  However, I am a strong believer in advocating for yourself and getting second opinions and asking questions to be able to make the best choices for myself.
0.640000	I think it depends on the type of doctor, but on the whole, I trust doctors to prescribe medications and diagnose, but I also trust my own feelings about my body and what I need. So I usually pit the two against each other. 
0.680000	I generally trust them becuase of all the schooling they had plus i can easily verify if they are lying by doing a quick search online in about 5 minutes
0.800000	I do trust my doctor because she is extremely honest with me and patient with me. She is still new to me since I have had her for 6 months but I already trust her 
0.520000	I often feel rushed and that my treatment is according to protocol, not individual needs.  I often have to remind my doctor about other medication, side effects, etc.
0.600000	the doctor i have no is really not a big help. it seems like he is only in it for the number of patients he can handle in a day. he often has senior citizens so its hard for to relate to the mid age group. he has gotten so much botox that his face is tight looking like something off of tv i call him a rockstar. i feel like he doesnt really care and this is one of the reasons why i am going to be finding me a new doctor this year so i hope it will be soon
0.720000	I've had a couple I have trusted and a couple I have not. My last physician in Hawaii I trusted a lot. I went in with severe pain in my intestines. The nurse wanted me to immediately go to the hospital for a colonoscopy. The doctor asked me some questions, looked at my medical history, and came to the conclusion that I had a non serious condition that could be treated with antibiotics. He gave me the choice of accepting his recommendation or going to the hospital. He explained the pros and cons of each. He gave me reasons for his recommendation and I went with it. He was correct in the end.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because I have a long history with him. He asks appropriate questions to see how I am doing or feeling. I answer his questions honestly & never withhold any information that could affect my care or diagnosis.
0.560000	I trust my doctor, because I expect that he has my best health interest at heart. Sometimes, this may not be true which makes it difficult for patients when someone they expect to help them is rather callous to their call for aid. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor or doctor's in general because otherwise why would I even go to them in the first place and if I am unsure of my doctor's ethic ability I would question everything about them.  That just doesn't sound like a good idea for my own health and I would be way more stressed out.  I trust my doctor because to me it's the best option.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to what is the right thing to do for me. He has treated me for so long and never done anything to misuse his trust. I feel confident he will make the best decisions for me and my long term health care. 
0.480000	"I don't feel as though a personal relationship of any sort has been established over time and his ""bedside manner"" is curt and distant. I sometimes feel as though I am just another task of the day to get over with as quickly as possible. I do think I need special attention, but become discouraged with I feel that our time is rushed or treated as entirely insignificant. "
0.640000	I do not have a primacy care physician, but I do feel that not all humans are perfect. As such, not all doctors are going to be perfect either and can either make mistakes, or purposefully mislead a patient for personal reasons.
0.840000	I think my doctor takes enough time to address my physical and mental health concerns. She takes the time to explain things to me and helps me to explore options if we do not have a solid answer for anything I am dealing with.
0.560000	My current physician has taken me very seriously and been open about all the options, however, past physicians have not at all
0.840000	My doctor always explains things thoroughly and answers all of my questions. He explains the side effects of medications before prescribing them to me, and allows me to decide on what I believe would be the best treatment for myself
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he is always upfront and honest. He takes the time to actually listen to my concerns and takes into consideration my opinions about my health. He works with me to get the kind of medicines that I also will approve of taking instead of giving me medicines that I believe are more dangerous for me to take. He seems very trustworthy and honest. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor's ideas and decisions, but I also allow for the possibility of human error or the fact that she might not know everything about what I'm feeling to give the exact solution I need. Whether that be because I left out something important or because she or I forgot to ask certain questions. My doctor is great, experienced, and well meaning so I don't doubt her but I don't take her word as a complete final decision either.
0.600000	I like to think that most doctors know what they are doing and try to help patients and do what is right for them in their lives.
0.800000	My doctor is always willing to listen to my concerns even when there are many patients out in the waiting, even though I try not to waste his time.
0.800000	I really trust my doctor because I have been with him for over 15 years and nothing he has stated so far has been false. He has the best in mind for me and will be honest when I am not doing something correctly.
0.680000	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  He is the expert and knows what's best for me.  However, I know that doctor's are overworked and stretched thin.  I am sometimes wary that they do things that are quicker or easier.  
0.600000	as we know little about the health concerns we have no other choice than believing doctor as we can't take risk with our life
0.760000	I believe doctors in general do have the patients' interest at hurt and thus is why I trust my primary care physician.
0.200000	I do not trust my primary care doctor because he tells me that I can only present one problem I am having during a visit. I have chronic issues, and I only go into see the doctor once a year, because he doesn't order tests, or seem to take me seriously when I present a problem. So, in turn, I don't trust that my primary care doctor really cares about me, or my chronic problems, and I don't bother going in to take care of anything because he won't do anything to help me feel better. Wish I had better insurance, so I could find a doctor that was interested in helping me feel better.
0.800000	I hardly ever see my physician, but during the times I have seen him, I feel like he listens to what I'm saying and has offered good suggestions.
0.520000	Recently discovered an enlarged thyroid.  My PCP ordered thyroid ultrasound but, did not order TSH level.  I had to call office and suggest this be ordered.  
0.840000	My physician takes the time to listen and does not rush me when I visit. They ask many questions and answer any I may have
0.520000	I don't fully trust my doctors because they're fallible and because I don't know their jobs and therefore can't know if they're truly correct or not.  But that doesn't bother me tremendously because I feel like I'm the ultimate decider on medical decisions and I'm a full participant in getting medical care.  I use the doctor as a resource, but not the final authority.  They answer to me, so I scrutinize their decisions and judgments while still recognizing their knowledge and experience.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician fully because he or she needs to build a relationship with one an other to gain the trust and to feel safe.It is important to trust them because they are smart about the information and always work in your best interest for you.
0.560000	I am close with my doctor.  They are always in a great mood and able to talk to me in a calm manner and I can trust what they are saying and doing is in my best interest.  I think that all doctors are in the job for the right reasons.
1.000000	My primary care doctor has been working many, many decades. He's very straight forward. My husbands sister also use to work for him, and she's called him an asshole but completely trusts him and his judgement. I feel the same way.
0.680000	I think that in general doctors have little incentive to be dishonest to patients. However, it is easy for people to have biases that influence them and effect trustworthiness, even if they meant to be honest.
0.720000	I have a hard time trusting doctors sometimes because some of them only seem to in it for the money and dont really have a personal care for helping people be healthy. 
0.800000	Even doctors nowadays doubt the efficiency of healthcare system advising patients not to trust physicians âany more than you trust your stockbroker (if you are ... Maybe this is the reason why many doctors are complaining on their patient's behavior accusing them of being âdifficult, nasty, obnoxious .
0.600000	My physician does not hesitate to tell me if there is something I should or should not be doing in regards to my health. She is frank and open with me, and displays concern when evaluating the issues I have. She often seems rushed, however, so I occasionally have doubts about how thorough she it.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because they have extensive training in their profession and the government makes sure they know their stuff.
0.720000	I donât have a close relationship with them, so I donât know them personally cannot trust them completely. What if theyâre told to prescribe a certain drug? I never know if thatâs occuring. 
0.520000	I don't have a primary care physician, so I'd have to say the reason I don't trust doctors in general is because they always seem too busy to really listen to me, and are careful only to avoid malpractice suits.
0.640000	I want to trust my doctor but perhaps it's TV or just my lack of health care growing up. I have an issue with trust. I mean it seems sometime they herd you like cattle. They see you for 2 minutes then it's time to pay and leave. They offer no personal connection. I feel like maybe doctors out in the country where things go at a slower pace and people care about each other more I could trust my doctor but here in the city I don't 
0.480000	Seems like he is into giving out pills like he is influenced by drug sales. So could be conflict of interest there.
0.800000	I generally trust doctors, their abilities, and intentions. My only source of distrust would come from them seeming too busy or distracted and making mistakes.
0.720000	I mostly trust my doctors to tell me what is wrong and how to fix it; they don't always agree with me or me them when diagnosing something or trying to get me to take pills or treatments I don't want to take or do. I believe they are genuinely trying to help me, but we don't always agree.
0.960000	I've been with the same group of primary care physicians for over 20 years. While the doctors/PAs change, they are always knowledgeable, current, honest, have a good bedside manor and answer any and all questions I have about any conditions, treatment options or costs. 
0.800000	I like her because she presents all options and treatments and pros and cons without biasing me towards them and she is open to conventional and non conventional treatments
0.560000	I trust doctors in general because they know the right things to do in order to improve your condition. They have the right response every single time.
0.720000	I have seen my doctor make mistakes before treating me. However, he is brilliant and helped keep my children healthy growing up so I give him credit. I feel as though he did overprescribe antibiotics for me, though, as I did end up with C-Diff in the hospital two years ago from prescriptions he wrote on my behalf.
0.680000	I do not go to my family doctor often but if I had a health condition that I needed to see him more frequently, my answer might change. Sometimes I feel like doctors are in a hurry to see their next patient that they do not see completely to my needs (which there are very few).
0.760000	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and she knows me.  She knows how my body reacts to certain drugs and other stimuli.  She believes what I tell her.  
0.920000	I have seen a few doctors at this point in my life and have had various different experiences with different ones.  I feel confident in the intelligence, concern, and care this doctor exhibits.  He is willing to take time with me and answers any and all questions I have.
0.720000	"I trust my doctor because she shows genuine concern and often discusses options with me in regards to my treatment. I am only neutral on some issues because I feel that she is very busy, and often is trying to get through things quickly, or discredits certain things I report as ""just my anxiety"" since I have a medical history with it."
1.000000	My primary care doctor is a family friend. He has also been my doctor for over 20 years and that I am aware of he has never lead me in the wrong direction. He might tell me something and then I will look it up and it will be what he says so therefore I tend to believe him. If I do the things he tells me to do I usually feel better.
0.600000	In all honesty, I do not currently have a primary care physician as I do not have health insurance. In general, I do trust the health profession however
0.560000	I just think that most doctors just want to get done with one paitent and then move on to the next. I also don't think that they listen very attentatively when you tell them something that doesn't agree with their preconceptions of the person they think the patient is.
0.800000	My doctor has taken the Hippocratic oath, and I have no doubt that he is looking out for my best interests at all times.  If I had a negro doctor, I might feel differently, but I have always found the orientals to be trustworthy
0.800000	I trust my primary care condition because it feels like she really cares about my health. She asks a lot of questions about any problems I have and doesn't rush to meet her next patient. She's very thorough.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she is the one who went to medical school and I am not, and because I am in good health after seeing her for medical problems. All my problems have always been resolved by going to the doctor so I have no reason not to trust her.
0.440000	I do trust that our primary care physician is capable of making proper decisions involving health care if they were to take the time to do so. Often, issues are misdiagnosed or overlooked because they are in a rush. The same goes for the doctors support system, such as office staff. Many times they are so busy that they overlook completing there tasks such as calling in prescriptions or referrals.
0.520000	not forthcoming with info and seem to rush through appointments.  Also, don't seem interested in the causes of medical conditions or events.  Not interested in probing further
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like that I can tell them what I need to tell them. I trust in what ever I need to say to the doc.
0.640000	I have two primary care physicians that work in the same facility. Generally, I trust them with my medical needs. I don't go in too often, so usually when I do go, there is a need for treatment. They are good at assessing the symptons and prescribing treatment. Occasionally, there was a need for follow up that wasn't taken care of but overall, I trust them.
0.840000	She seems intelligent and puts a lot of thought into treatment. She researched my case before I see her and so I know that she cares and does what she can to give me the best advice.
0.680000	My primary care physician is more interested in prescribing medication rather than preventative care. I feel like all he ever wants to do is give me some drug other than give me better life habit talks.
0.800000	In the past several years, I have visited and communicated with my PCP for several times. I am satisfied with the experience of each visit. There is no way to complaint at all. I also communicate with other patients and they share the same opinion with me.
0.760000	My primary care physician has proven himself to be reliable, knowledgeable, and if was unsure about something would admit it and find out the information. That is why I can trust him because he is willing to admit when he doesn't know and willing to find out the information. That how I know I have a good doctor because he doesn't have a god complex.
0.400000	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I think that medicine can be trendy and when my primary reccomends a procedure or exam that I think is unecessay I usually go with my gut feeling.  I have not taken certain test ie colonostomy for example because I don't believe the risk however so small is worth the possible pay off.  This is a procedure that is now common but I feel unecessary in most cases.
0.760000	Overall I trust the doctors I have see.  However, the last time I made a Dr's appt. the office scheduled me with  a PA, I did not like this because no one told me I wasn't seeing an MD,  therefore at this practice I they were not being truthful or honest with me, and will not be using this practice again. This did cause me to distrust them.
0.200000	I have known my PCP since I was born. My parents really liked him, but I never was comfortable around him. At times he would send me for too many tests and other times he wouldn't send me enough. He never seemed to care about me, just what made him feel important. The Physician Assistants in his office are just as bad, if not worse. Just recently I switched my PCP and have an upcoming appointment with my new PCP 
0.520000	Sometimes doctors lie for their own benefit, it is bad but it is definitely true. I do not fully trust them
0.680000	I feel like my doctor cares, but is also very busy. Sometimes it feels like a whirlwind once she's in the room with me. She always asks if I have any questions before she leaves, but sometimes I feel so caught up in the pace that I can't really think of anything at the time. It's nice that her office has an online portal that I can send in a message and get a response from a nurse after the fact. 
0.800000	I trust my medical doctor because she is a person that has been there for me throughout my entire life and has always done everything that she can to make sure that I feel comfortable and get well as soon as possible. I know that I can ask my doctor questions about anything and everything and that she'll try her best to answer whatever it is that I want to know without any kind of hesitation. My doctor is someone that I feel will always have my best interests in mind.
0.920000	My husband and I are currently going through fertility treatment so my primary care physician is a reproductive endocrinologist. She has an amazing track record of helping people get pregnant. She genuinely cares about us and celebrates victories and mourns losses with us. This makes me trust her and her opinions so much more.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because when I told him about my coughing and inability to breathe, he actually took me seriously, unlike the previous three. Now I have two inhalers (maintenance steroid and emergency albuterol) that help me breathe better. That's all I want from a doctor: mutual respect enough to take me seriously when I say something is a problem. (And he doesn't pathologize my sexuality, which also helps.)
0.360000	I haven't seen my doctor very often since I've been going to him for 2 years so it's hard for me to trust him. I have seen him 4 times in the 2 years. I don't know him very well, but from past experience, doctors in general don't know it all and are humans and make mistakes. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because first off, he always remembers me, even when I have not seen him in quite some time. He is very personable towards me and makes me feel comfortable. He allows me to express what I feel that I need before making his own professional recommendations.
0.760000	I trust my doctor. He knows much more than i do. Always explains everything, even if i don't ask. I don't think he cares more about what is convenient  for him
0.680000	"I generally trust my doctor to prescribe what's best for me, but not to the fullest. I have sometimes felt like I was being rushed out the door instead of them hearing me out all the way. I have an anxiety issue that comes with very frightening chest pains occasionally. I was seen for this problem and had all my labs done and my heart checked out which ruled out anything ""serious."" I was put on medication for anxiety and not really followed up with. I stopped and just did the research for myself on what's wrong with me since my doctor couldn't seem to figure out what it was beyond anxiety."
0.440000	I have a medical condition with my back that no doctor has yet been able to help with. The last doctor I saw about this had me as a patient for two years. I followed his advice, consented to treatments, and did everything as he wished it and got 0 results. At the end he decided that he didnt know what was wrong with me exactly and I stopped seeing him. It only took thousands of dollars in treatments for him to figure out that the cash cow was dry. 
1.000000	Speaking to my doctor is like speaking to a family member. He's very open and honest, but has a very warm bedside manner. He makes me feel very relaxed, and I know he always has the best suggestions for my health and well-being.
0.920000	It's not a business that has a lot of corruption or under-the-table payments, so doctors have little reason to lie or sway you in a direction that's not beneficial to you.
0.760000	My doctor is patient and takes the time to answer any questions I might have. I never feel rushed in his office. He also never seems pushy, and gives me all of my potential options. He's never pushed a medication or treatment on me. His bedside manner is excellent.
0.840000	I trust my doctor to know what is right for me because she generally chooses the option that she knows will be covered with insurance and tries to get me the best treatment while also considering my financial situation.
1.000000	My primary care physician has always been there for more over the years. I have been seeing him for almost 10 years now. He always cares about my well being and does everything he can to make sure I am in good physical and mental health.
1.000000	I feel that he is well educated in his field and he very friendly.  I feel that he truly loves what he doing. I also just trust Kaiser to hire the best doctors.
0.760000	"i trust most doctors, it depends on how they 'deal"" with me. As long as theyre willing to answer questions and not rush you out."
1.000000	I have the best doctor. Recently had the flu, saw the doc and got medication. After four days my doctor called me at eight at night to see how I was doing. He treats me like family and I admire him so much.
1.000000	My doctor has on multiple occasions spent more time with me than she had to to make sure I'm content or that she figures out what proper course of action is. If she doesn't know something she tells me and then seeks out other sources of information to help her make an informed decision.
0.720000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she has been with my family for many years. She took over a practice from another older physician that helped my mother and needed to retire. 
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician sometimes because he's made mistakes, rushed to his own judgment, and said things to me that made me feel like he was looking out for himself rather than looking out for my needs. That said, I still use him because he's been willing to admit when he's wrong, correct his behavior, and move forward.
0.880000	I trust our primary care physician but prefer to deal with her exclusively and not her Physician Assistants. The PA's that work at her medical office aren't quite as knowledgeable and don't provide the same level of thorough analysis required for our day to day health needs.
0.400000	It's just one person, and a single person can be wrong despite having good intentions. I would much rather know the opinion of multiple doctors or people with experience.
0.680000	I trust them to use the knowledge they have or to refer me to another who is more specilized. I would distrust if they felt they could handle all troubles.
0.720000	They know what's best for me. Even if they aren't totally honest about the best course of action, they still more about these things than I do.
0.760000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with this same doctor since I was a child and he has been very courteous and helpful with my medical needs. My doctor is located in a small facility so there are not that many patients he sees in a day. The care is very personal and positive. He has a way of talking to people that is very relaxing and comforting to everyone he sees. There has never been a time that I have doubted the advice or treatment he has given me.
0.760000	She is open to new studies and information. She listens to me. She stays on top of new information as much as she can herself. She will consult with others. 
0.680000	My doctor seems like a sincere individual who would not do anything to intentionally harm me.  He also seems to enjoy his job and be highly qualified.  He does not get frustrated when you ask him questions, and always has an answer ready.  Nonetheless, if i had a serious medical issue, i would of course get a second or third opinion.  This isnt because i distrust my doctor, it is just because i feel it would be the smart thing to do.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because my questions are always answered. I feel like I. Always taken seriously no matter the situation.  When something is wrong he always goes above and beyond to figure out whatâs the matter. I always feel like I can open up about whatâs wrong and not feel embarrassed. 
0.680000	I recently switched to a new primary care physician and am working on building trust after a previously bad experience with my former doctor. I also have intense anxiety and distrust in general.
0.400000	I donât really trust my doctors completely. They tend to never give me options and just go with what they want me to do. I went in for back pain and I asked to be sent to chiropractor, but she was a firm believer in physical therapy, so denied my request and sent me to physical therapy which didnât help and she still refuses to do what I think is right for my health. 
1.000000	my primary care physician is very direct and honest about all aspects of my health and well being. my primary care physician always takes the time to make sure that i know exactly what is going on and that i have all the information that i need, and that i know what all of my options are.
0.360000	There have been a few times I have seen my doctor with issues that seemed bad and felt unable to communicate to her how bad I felt. I often feel like she isn't really listening to me. Only to go on to another specialist type and find out she should have known how to help me with this problem. 
0.520000	I think that pharmaceutical companies have an unethical amount of control over doctors prescriptions and treatment methods for patients and most people are not inclined to bite the hand that feeds.
0.800000	As I mentioned earlier, I always wanted to be a doctor growing up and I even went as far as to enroll premed for 4 full time college years before I changed my mind.  I did not do this for money.  I did this because being a doctor always appealed to me.  I like to solve problems and the human body and what it is capable of astonishes me.  I like to think that most if not all doctors got into medicine for the same reasons.  They want to build that trust with their patients.  Without patients, they have no practice so I have to believe that they are to be trusted or else they would not have gone into medicine.
0.800000	I have had a relationship with my primary care physician for many years.  Throughout those years I have never had a reason to question his care.  He is a straight shooter and tell you what you need to hear whether you want to hear it or not.
0.520000	I think my doctor is well educated and has patients best interests at heart however I also think at time her own prejudices get in the way of effective treatment.
0.800000	I've known for this doctor for years, and for the most part he has been quite helpful. Thereby, when he outlines a plan for me to follow, I generally follow it. There have mostly positive results. Thereby, increasing my trust in him. 
0.800000	I have had the same primary care physician for quite some time. He is thorough, makes me feel comfortable, and is overall a great person. There's not a time when I'm at his office where I do not feel safe and at ease. He has never steered me in the wrong direction either. 
0.720000	No matter how disinterested my doctors have seemed sometimes, I still have faith in their expertise to provide me with the right evaluations. Even though you get treated like a piece of furniture in healthcare clinics, the doctors are still good.
0.480000	I don't really trust them and find myself changing and getting second and third opinions all the time. I feel like the doctors don't really pay attention to what I am saying or use their head to think of outside the box ideas. Basically I tell them how I feel and they agree, they don't ask or think of ways or things my pain could be from. I could say that I feel like a horse and they would give me horse pulls.
0.760000	My issue is less a trust of the doctor themselves, and more of an institutionalization of thought. There are other ways to heal/treat people than what is typically catered to in a hospital, although a Doctor may not always be aware of them.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I have my reasons for this. I trust my doctor because he will listen to me when I have questions that I need to ask. He is very generous and makes me feel like I'm important. I've been seeing my doctor for years now and never have I felt that I could not talk to him. I've been quite worried about a lot of things in the past and he has assured me that I was going to be alright.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me conflicting or incorrect advice from what I can tell. He always spends a long time with me making sure that I have all concerns addressed. He is professional and courteous and I appreciate his work and attention.
0.560000	I trust my doctor in that I trust him or her to not harm me in any way. But in a world of referrals, its often easier to ship me off to a specialist and still charge me, then to actually do things that will help me. Sometimes a specialist can be the right call, and sometimes its just convenient for the doctor.     
0.800000	She takes a great interest in listening to my concerns and questions. She tells me that I am in charge and that she is here to help me make the best decisions. She lets me know that she is determined to help me get well. 
0.840000	 My primary care physician at this time is very patient and open to explaining things to me in ways I can understand.   She takes the time I need to make sure I am comprehending what she's explaining.   I feel safe asking her anything. 
0.720000	Doctors go through so many years of schooling and training and they are so knowledgeable you have to trust them.
0.800000	My experience with my primary care doctor has been positive. She has not tried to push unwanted medications on me and she tells me exactly what she is thinking.
0.640000	Regarding doctors in general (I haven't seen a primary care physician in many years), I feel like I can trust them somewhat. As I've gotten older though, I think I've become more skeptical about doctors, knowing that, for example, doctors get a higher kickback on certain drugs or treatments than others, so there is a benefit to them to get you to take a particular treatment option. I still trust doctors in diagnosis, but treatment I'm more skeptical. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that we can have made a connection over the past five years. He always tells me how it is with my physical condition and any issues that may be occurring in my life when I visit him. He is thorough with explaining all of my vitals, my lab results, my physical activity, and my history. In addition, he lets me know when I should start doing something different in my eating habits such as eating less fatty and sugary food items. I also think he cares about me when he gives me a serious look and starts critiquing my lifestyle.  
0.560000	I do not currently have a primary care physician.  Doctors that I have visited in the past seem to get stuck on one particular notion and don't listen well to what I feel.  Additionally, they are not interested in whether or not I can afford the test they are prescribing.
0.600000	TRUST A LITTLE BECAUSE THEY ARE DOCTOR'S AND PRETTY SURE THEY DONT WANT TO BE SUED, SO THATS WHY I TRUST THEM. BUT SOMETIMES I DONT BECAUSE THEY JUST MIGHT BE DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.
0.440000	I do not see my primary care doctor very often. I feel like my once a year checkin is not enough for me to build a relationship. 
0.880000	I have a very high level of trust for my primary care physician. I have been seeing him off and on for over a decade now, and he has never been anything but polite, helpful, and understanding. Every time I have an appointment with him he makes sure all of my needs are met and that all of my questions are answered right there. I am very satisfied.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is great - she is very direct and straightforward while also being friendly and pleasant. She does not sugar-coat and is open to my getting second opinions, and she is happy to answer all of my questions (I bring lists). She never seems rushed.
0.800000	I have to trust my doctor because who else would I turn to when I have a medical  problem. If I don't trust my doctor, I would never check if I have a terrible disease and I could possibly die because of that. Basically, I trust my doctor because of necessity. 
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician. I have been for years with this physician. Through his appointments, there is no real reason for anyone to have to distrust my primary care physician at any point in time.
0.920000	I do not have a primary care physician, but I have been to the doctor a few times in the past couple of years. Every time I have gone, I have been treated with respect, and the doctor has been honest with me every single time. I have no reason to distrust doctors in general, based on past experiences I have had with doctors. I have always gotten better when following a doctor's advice.
0.640000	My primary care physician is very busy.  I know that he has many patients.   I think he is thorough and careful but sometimes he may miss something due to being busy.   There is always other patients waiting whenever I visit him.  I always feel a bit rushed.   
0.440000	I distrust my primary care physicial somewhat because their primary obligation might not be to me, but instead to their career and their financial obligations.  Plenty of doctors have plenty of lawyers to offset complications of medical errors and other eugenicidal malfeasance.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I feel like he has my best interest and wants the best for me long term in my health.
0.600000	I tend not to trust doctors in general to a great degree. I have list family members to negligent care from doctors. I myself have a rare cardiovascular condition that most local doctors don't know a great deal about and, more importantly, don't try to learn. I feel very afraid overall and cannot be reassured by local doctors because of that reason. I have already had one major heart attack with cardiac arrest so one would think they would pay attention. 
0.920000	My doctor is very thorough at explaining my different treatment options and also understands her limitations. After working with her for sometime to find treatment for my migraines she referred me to a specialist who was able to help.
0.560000	I have little trust in doctors because in me experience, they have been very money orientated. They schedule more and more appointments, not because they care about you, but how much your insurance will pay them for each visit.
0.440000	A doctor just does not have time to provide a high level of service to every patient, even if they are motivated to do so. They are also subject to fatigue, influence from drug manufacturers, and biases. Sometimes their knowledge can be outdated, if they are decades into their career, or too green, if they are brand new doctors. 
0.800000	I have a military doctor, and I always think that being in the military, you can't always mess up things and you always think about the servicemember, and not your own self or convenience.
0.800000	I trust my healthcare provider because I have been going to him for the past twenty plus some years. My doctors has always done what is best for me and never put his interest before my own health.
0.720000	Most doctors have the best in mind for you. I usually trust most doctors and because I can often understand what is going on, I can agree or disagree and understand rationale because of my health care background. Very rarely do I find a doctor that I don't trust at all, if at all. Sometimes they aren't the most thorough, but if I feel the need to tell them to assess something, I will. I keep open communication and talk with them frequently, especially in the patient room and clarify things that I don't understand or need more explanation. 
0.800000	My doctor has been in the area for a very long time.  My husband and I both go to him.  He has actually helped find the right diagnoses for something that has been overlooked for many many years.  He is thorough and takes his time talking to me about what I am there for.  He is well respected in the area.
0.760000	Because we've known each other for a long time now and all of the treatments I've done from him have had no issues up to this point.  I trust my doctor to make the best recommendations for me and keep me healthy.
0.360000	Although currently I do not have a primary care provider, I have had many MANY throughout my 22 years of existence and there were so many that didn't know what the heck they were talking about. When I can go online and find medical documents from the actual US government along with WHO and the CDC to name a few, showing contradictory information to what I am told by a doctor, it starts to shake your faith in em. Then we also have to get into the deeper part of, do we trust the government? Do we trust WHO or the CDC? And if we do, should be believe them over our own doctors? Should we trust our doctors medical training was equal to or superior to the training of those that work for the government? Can we trust those workers even have credentials and how easily can that be faked or covered up? As you can see the reasons run very very deep and is much more than I care to type here.
0.800000	My primary care physician takes the time not only to examine me for whatever I am there for, but also spends time asking questions of how things are going for me in general.  If she cannot answer a question I have she will refer me to the appropriate person.
0.600000	Doctors some times are required to focus on the bottom line and cost cutting rather than the well-being of patients. They do not necessarily want to do this, but in order to make a profit, they may have to. For instance, they may prescribe prescription drugs that are not necessary in order to bring in more of a profit. They may also give unnecessary tests in order to bill insurance companies. 
0.680000	I generally trust my doctor but sometimes I think he just does what is easy and convenient rather than what is necessarily best for me. I feel pretty good overall about trusting my doctor.
0.960000	My doctor is very sincere and always go to the point.  She was very helpful with a health problem I was having for months, do all the tests and then recommended all the procedures available and what she thinks was the best for me.  It was my decision base on the information she gave me about all the procedures, secondary effects and results.  
0.880000	Ive seen my doctor for a long time, since I was a child, so I feel very comfortable in their choices and opinions. They have never let me down before so I dont see why they would now. They've always taken good care of me in guiding on the right path and being very transparent.
0.760000	I trust because he has been very effective in his diagnosis. His advises has always been for my better health. He is seriously concerned about my well being.If I have a medical problem, he always clearly makes me understand the situation in very simple layman language. 
0.600000	I've recently switched doctors and only seen the new one once so I haven't formed a real solid opioion yet, but so far she seems nice and interested and takes her time and listens when I talk so far all is good. Time will tell. 
0.720000	i trust my doctor he has always been there for me and let me know everything that i need to know and explains it to me so i understand it 
0.520000	"i dont have a close relationship with my dr because im relatively healthy. So i only see her once a year. I dont even think she really remembers me. I think she just does a cursory job at my physical. I have had one health problem recently (gall bladder) she just said ""have it out"" she didnt discuss any other options she just referred me to a surgeon."
0.560000	I don't put too much trust in doctors because I know they get kickbacks from certain medications and don't always look out for their patients. I know they mean well, but sometimes they don't do what's best and I don't want to put myself in that risk over something small that I can treat.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because I can talk to them and they will be honest. However, they are still busy and will push me off if I let her.
0.720000	"I trust my primary care physician because she is thorough. There is no ""t"" uncrossed or ""I"" undotted. She asks all of the necessary questions and has a great bed-side manner. So, by being thorough and caring I completely trust her."
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough and has helped me with a few medical problems that I've had. She is patient and kind.
0.800000	They are my doctor and I do not believe that they would intentionally cause any harm. My doctor has a family and he seems to really care about people. I have no reason to not trust my doctor. 
0.720000	I have never had a reason not to trust my doctors.  I'd rather give them the benefit of the doubt.  
0.840000	I see my nurse practitioner instead of my doctor as my primary care provider.  I trust health care providers that are intelligent and kind and I prefer to understand all aspects before engaging in care.
0.800000	She is quick but thorough, makes sure to explain anything if I need her to, doesnât if I donât, tells me what I should/shouldnât do not what I have to do/not do.
0.760000	My doctor has never been judgemental with me when I'm in her office. She encourages frank and open conversations and she's been able to clarify several situations for me and always seems to be able to answer my questions or check on it if she doesn't know the answer. I really value that transparency. 
0.800000	With the info you give them and the info they have a round then you can stand back and trust then that they are looking out for you
0.480000	I distrust some physicians because they are being paid by drug companies. On top of this they often receive a specific training that I may not agree with. Due to this I am more likely to want to see a holistic or alternative physician that I would trust would be open minded like me.
0.440000	I don't really have a primary care physician but I did see an orthopedist last year.  I kind of felt that his wish to go through with the surgery made it more difficult for me to get him to talk about what my prognosis would be if I didn't have the surgery.
0.520000	Sometimes i feel doctors are so jaded by patients that they dont really take the time to listen and respond.
0.600000	I feel that the doctor has too many uncertain opinions at times. They run a practice and go by what you tell them and form opinions. However, some things they do know and i give them credit for.
0.600000	I havent been seeing my primary care physician for too long so it is very hard to gauge my level of trust in her. She is competent but, she lacks warmth. Im not sure I will continue seeing her
0.800000	My current primary care doctor is the first to take my concerns seriously. He is doing everything he can for me so that we can find answers for the symptoms I have been experiencing. 
0.400000	I don't trust my doctors decisions because he is always in a rush when he is visiting patients. He doesn't take the time to explain all my treatment options. When I tell him about symptoms that I have been feeling he doesn't do any tests or anything until months later. 
0.800000	I trust him because of how long I have known him.  It has been so long and I have seen him so many times that the trust grew.  I know about his family and other things about him.  Plus since he has done many procedures on me and I am healthier because of them I trust him.  He has not let me down and is there for me when I need anything including just to talk.  He takes his time with me which is important.
0.840000	Of course I trust my doctor. What am I supposed to do otherwise? He or she has the education and experience to be able to best help me.
0.720000	I don't put total trust in any man, but for the most part I have a good relationship with my doctor and have been open with her.  We discuss treatments together and i can bring to her new treatments to discuss and together we decide. 
0.560000	I trust somewhat because they are trying.  However, I think they are sometimes rushed and it is difficult to get appointments on time.  I think they try but sometimes are short staffed as well.
0.720000	Overall I think my primary care doctor is thoughtful and knowledgeable and wants what's best for me. I do think it could be possible that she might miss something that could be wrong and I also don't know that she has the time to stay up on all of the latest treatment options. 
0.800000	I like her. I don't know her for very long but she follows up and does what she says she is going to do. She seems trustworthy so far. I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. She seems to care about her patients.
0.760000	I have trust in my primary care physician because is always straight forward and makes an effort to guide me to make good decisions and helps me weigh all different options that I have.
0.680000	I trust doctors to a point, i feel as if some doctors could use a bit more training and i do not always trust them.  All in all i do trust most doctors it just really depends on teh situation 
0.800000	I like to think they do the job in order to help me feel better. Admittedly, I have felt a little rushed in a busy office, but I have never felt like they were deliberately being careless. I think they have my best interests in mind, even though I have had some unsuccessful treatments. I think this is a problem of specialization, as some GP's do not have the in depth knowledge to treat specific medical issues. I trust my GP with my overall health in the end.
0.840000	I'm not an expert as to what is okay for my body. If I thought I was dying, I would certainly think about their opinions of possible diagnosis or treatment that was available to me.
0.800000	I've seen my doctor for over a decade now, and we get along great.  She's been a good help to me, and as far as I know has not ever guided me wrong.  I have no reason to doubt her. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor at the VA because he is very thorough and if I don't ask enough or the right questions about things, he will start asking me relevant questions about what is going on with me. Things that I have complained about in the past, he will also cover with me to be sure that those issues have been addressed as well. Any test that is needed he will order and follow through to be sure that everything is up to date as needed.
0.560000	Sometimes my doctor give medicine in cases that are unnecessary and set up for appointment after appointment for no reason.
0.800000	"My Dr. is very attentive and willing to talk to you if you have questions. he never pushes any ""drugs"" and always seems to be willing to help you not come bck to his ofice. He is personalble and isdedicated to huis patients. He once saw me without an appointment (ona busy day) because I had no other day in which I could return. "
0.880000	I have seen my primary care physician for over 15 years and he always treats me with kindness and respect.  He will take the time to explain things to me in detail and help me decide the best route to take in my care.  He never rushes the visit and this makes me feel I can trust that he has my best interest at heart.
0.520000	Knowledgeable but doctors will rush to see too many patients.  Will not go in depth unless problem is already too far gone. Prevention not a thing with most and don't take their time with each patient.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing the same doctor for various things over several years. I have never received bad advice. I feel like he listens to my statements and questions. I feel like he makes informed and educated decisions about my health.
1.000000	Mostly thinking of my pediatrician, but she has proven herself as knowledgable and deeply caring about our situation even though she is overwhelmed by other patients at the time.
0.720000	I think that for the most part, my doctor will recommend what is best for me. However, there are times when the office is very busy. At those times, I do not always feel as though my doctor is fully listening and may be in too much of a hurry for me to feel confident in his recommendations.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because we have had a successful patient-doctor relationship for about 5 years now. She has been open and honest about my condition and whatever treatment plans we may pursue for specific conditions. She tells me about the benefits, the side-effects, and what she thinks may be best for me. She also welcomes my input and will change our treatment plan based on what I tell her. I feel that I can tell her anything.
0.520000	The primary care physicians I have dealt with are overworked and unable to completely focus on one case at a time. That is the nature of health care today for all but the very rich. This is just the way it is. I feel responsible for knowing and researching as much as I can for my own good. 
0.400000	I think doctors treat all bodies like if they are the same. Just because you have heartburn doesn't mean all patients should get the same pill. Doctors should look deeper into what lifestyle changes they can make and maybe certain prescriptions work well for some but not all.
0.520000	I recently had to change primary care doctor's because the one that had been my doctor for many years retired. The new doctor that I have does not seem that dependable. As a matter of fact, I am in the processing of finding a different one.
0.800000	I don't see any reason not to trust him. He's a medical professional who's been to school and been in practice for many years. It's his job to know what he's talking about.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician as I have gone to him for many years and he has always been honest and upfront about any problems or procedures that needed to be done.
0.480000	Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I never put full trust in doctor's because they are human. They don't know everything and I always question.
0.880000	I think my doctor does an excellent job of listening to me and following up.  I went in describing symptoms that I did not think added up to anything. She immediately ordered bloodwork for me and we learned that I have hypothyroidism. My doctor appears to really pay attention and I trust that she is working toward my best interests.
0.720000	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part, He does what he can to help me when I come to him with a problem. But one time when I suspected I had a ear infection coming and he said it was my neck. Few days later I had an infection
0.600000	I don't trust my primary care physician because I never hear back from them about test results. Also because I always have to wait forever for her to come back and then feel rushed when she does come in. 
0.520000	I do believe doctors want to help people. The issue I have is hospitals are driven by profit and people can be driven by rewards. So I may have high blood pressure but instead of trying to give me a diet to follow they go right for the medication. They do that because its a pay back to them. If I have pain in my knee the first thing I dont want is an opiod but thats the go to becasue there is so much money in it. So in all I trust them to help but I dont trust them to do it the cheapest or more reasonable way.
0.880000	My doctor is always very thorough when I see him. I've never had any issues with him, like being misdiagnosed or given a medication that I reacted badly to. I've generally had a positive experience with my current primary care physician. I trust that he knows what he is doing. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I know him very well. He is more than just my physician, he is my friend. The decisions he makes are in my best interest. 
0.680000	It is easy to trust a doctor if they are willing to give you time to talk to them.  Many doctors are in and out so quickly that it's had to even get an impression of them.
0.320000	I usually go to the poor clinic and the doctors there are terrible. The one I saw the most was checking information on his phone to make sure he knew what to do with me. I had no trust in his judgment I got better by checking Internet and finding a cure myself.
0.840000	My primary care physician takes great care of me. She is attentive and remembers details and LISTENS to me. I have seen many other doctors whether walk-in or specialists who do not listen to what I say. If they do not listen to me, they can't possibly diagnose me correctly. If a doctor is dismissive or rude, I won't trust a word out of their mouth.I find a new doctor as soon as possible. Last year, I had a piece of my jaw come loose and fall out of my mouth (it was as horrible as it sounds), in the beginning it just hurt a lot, and I could see my bone through my gums. The male doctor I saw at the walk-in told me there was no way it was my jaw and I probably had a cankersore. I asked him to look and he glanced into my mouth without a flashlight. Yeah, I spat out a piece of my jaw a few weeks later after several appointments with an oral surgeon. 
0.720000	My PCP is thorough and detail-oriented, but I also feel like he dismisses what he sees as minor issues too easily. He's also quick to send me elsewhere to a specialist if anything even remotely complex comes up.
0.840000	I am a very health individual, so I do not go to the doctor's very often; but when I do her recommendations seem appropriate and well-thought out.
0.560000	I think he's okay; my main thing with him is he always wants to send me to a specialist. I know myself, I am not going to make 14 different appointments to get a PAP, a colonoscopy, a mammogram...it's just too much hassle. I would rather have all my health checkups done at one place. He does listen, but doesn't delve into things, like I take wellbutrin and I'm not sure that is the solution but he doesn't ask me about or recommend anything else. He's a nice guy, I'm just not overly enamored of him but it's too much work to find another Doctor. 
0.440000	"My current primary care physician worked in an ER. He still has the ""treat and street"" mentality. He will only go over any concern specific to what the appointment was originally scheduled for, and will not allow time to go over any new issues or concerns that I have. "
0.480000	They do not seem to listen to me often about what is wrong. Or think that family history of something is anything more than me being stupid and an huh strung
0.440000	Doctors I like in general, because I feel they honestly want to help others but they have to rely on what they are taught. What they're taught generally doesn't align with my health goals however. I generally expect doctors to prescribe medication of some sort for whatever the ailment might be. I can't trust any decisions that involve me taking medication. If doctors prescribed particular foods and natural things that could remedy the ailment, I may feel differently about trusting their decisions.
0.640000	I have very mixed feelings when it comes to this. I sometimes feel that they are genuinly worried about what is wrong when on the flipside I have had moments where I feel that they are just trying to make it through appoinmtnets or just make quick money. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because she goes the extra mile and has ordered tests be done just to be sure of something she thought. She has passion for what she does and has my health and well being as her top priority. 
0.360000	He always seems busy and does not provide enough details face to face. Depending too much on his staff instead of providing personal care.
0.200000	Because A lot of Doctors have been known to false diagnose a person Blacks are high in that trick.  Example tell someone black they have a lump then who are they to know the future. They say you need to take Chemo therapy we THINK!!! its Cancer. Lies. Then 2 months later they Die. Secretly murdered by a Doctor
0.680000	It is someone that I have been seeing for quite some time.  If he does something wrong I think its just from lack of knowledge.  There isn't a lot of time to be spent with each patient.  
0.720000	i've visited my doctor a couple of times and I do feel like they really care about me as a person and want me to be healthy. I've not had any negative experiences with them and plan on continuing to go visit them annually or more often.
0.680000	I believe that my primary physician is completely capable and competent to execute his duties well. I do not doubt my doctor's conclusions.
1.000000	So far everything that my doctor has told me has been one hundred percent open. He hasn't hidden anything from me or told me half truths. I have a lot of trust in him and don't have any kind of doubts of what he tells me. I follow everything what he says. My doctor also answers any question I have, whether it be a dumb one or not. He always answers my questions to the fullest of his ability. I feel I can continue trusting him in dealing with my health. That is why I trust my doctor in whatever he tells me.
0.480000	Doctors are paid to tell you what they think you want to have done.  They don't really care about what is best for you, they want you to do what is going to make them the most money.  They are also paid by pharmaceutical companies to push certain drugs on you that you probably don't need.
0.680000	I trust him to an extent, I mean i do go to him because he knows more about my body and what could be wrong with it, however he is pretty fresh out of school so he still lacks experience.
0.680000	I always trust my doctor. He has helped me deal with some very important health issues and always been so easy to recover. He is over all very very polite and very careful at my disorders.
0.800000	i trust my primary care physician because when i see her she calls personally to give me my test results and after and before examinations she always asks a ton of questions about my health to make sure that I'm healthy and i understand everything she said and the things we discussed
0.640000	I have never really had a regular doctor, so I've never really gotten to know one very well. The doctor I have currently I like a great deal. I trust her decisions and she is very kind and explains things very well. I have only seen her a handful of times though.
1.000000	I trust mu doctor because he is thorough.  He explains all the possibilities and potential consequences when making a diagnosis and offering treatment.  He then asks allows me to make the decision given the information presented.
0.640000	I generally trust that my doctor is trustworthy however during my pregnancy I did feel that I wasn't always presented with all the information or options due to her preconceived notions about my twin pregnancy and age. 
0.760000	I like and generally trust my PCP as a person, because he seems honest and he really does know a lot.  However, looking at him as a physician, I can't honestly say that I trust any doctor completely.  This is mainly because of the constraints put on them by insurance and ideology as well as the influence of Big Pharma, but it also has to do with their patient load and how exhausted they might be.  I know I don't think well when I'm exhausted, and neither will any doctor.  
0.480000	Well i think i have to trust him because he knows what he is doing. I think I'm kind of safe trusting him and his methods. 
0.640000	They make their choices baswd on their best knowledge. Sometimes they can be wrong. I only put complete trust in God.
0.520000	In general, I see doctors as people doing a job. A PCP does not usually have deep knowledge about whatever specific problem you're having, but they are able to refer you to a specialist who can possibly help you if you need it. PCPs are basically drug dealers for the pharmaceutical companies.
0.840000	I trust his expertise when it comes to health and what he has to say to me. Normally doctors have a great degree of training and experience. Now and then they may mess up but it is rare. My particular doctor i trust very much and he would always be honest with me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor enough to be able to accociate basic common symptoms and figure out the a good approach to taking care of those symptoms. I do believe the pharmacist have a much better understanding the scripts that they write out.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because if I didn't, then who else would I go to. In general, to me, it is very important to trust in the people who take of you, especially doctors who have done their job for a very long time. I trust mine because I know she has the best interest of my health and in helping me out when I need it.
0.680000	For the most part I trust that my doctor has my best interest in mind.  But I also know that I am one of many patients for him.  He is often following the protocols that he has to follow and does not know me as well as I know myself.
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician, but not too much. I always try to get answers from multiple sources, so I never fully go with what one individual says.
0.720000	I trust the doctor will help me make the best decision for my health. However, they are human and have feelings sometimes that influence their opinion. 
0.760000	I had a couple of negative experiences with doctors, but overall my experiences have been very positive. My doctor is very thorough, takes time to answer questions and discuss concerns, and never made me feel like I was being rushed, or like a number.
0.800000	I love my Primary Care Physician. I had been to a ton of doctors and was miserable. I saw her twice and she figured out what had wrong with me for a long time. One medication completely changed my life. She saved me. I trust her completely. But doctors in general, I only half trust them. You never know when you get a screwy one. 
0.200000	I don't trust my current psychiatrist. I changed to him for the convenience of his location to my home as opposed to the 1/2 hour I spent trying to get to my other psychiatrist's office. So I changed doctor's for medication management. The doctor called my pharmacy, found out the medications I was currently on, and prescribed those to me. He does not ask me how I feel when I see him or anything really about my life like my last psychiatrist. I don't feel like I am anything other than an insurance payment to him. 
0.960000	I have a basic knowledge of the medical field, they went to school for this, therefore their knowledge trumps mine.
0.800000	I don't have a primary care physician but generally trust doctors. Most doctors, I believe, go into their profession because they are interested in helping people. Still I am sure to research treatments outside of my time at the doctor's office. Even when doctors are perceived as trustworthy, I think it's important to be informed and proactive in your treatment.
0.600000	I mostly trust my physician, but I also do my own research just in case anything went amiss, after all, it's our own body, and we should do most of the jobs taking care of it
0.720000	I trust my primary physician to do her best but no one is perfect and everyone has flaws, so I don't completely trust her because she can make a mistake due to human error.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I see him every day at work, and we have a friendship outside of work. If you can't trust someone at happy hour, then where can you trust him? Especially when it comes to doctors. 
0.720000	I feel slightly distrustful of them because they need to push certain diagnosis and drugs and are overworked and overbooked.
0.520000	Doctors only know what they are taught and rarely, in my experiences, actually do more research.  As a result, I dont have much trust in drs.
0.840000	He has always been correct in the past.  He treats me with respect.  He does not order unnecessary tests, but does order those that cannot or should not be avoided.
0.760000	Thus far the recommendations of my Dr.(s) have been a positive and appropriate. I had a condition a few years ago and my OB-GYN recommended I start a daily medication. I don't like to take medications if I can avoid it but after following his advise my health improved and I have not had any problems with this condition in 2 years. 
0.720000	He gives it to you straight.  Very thorough. Sometimes he is took much about treating the symptom rather than solving the real problem causing the symptom. He is open to alternative medicines.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she takes her position seriously and tries her best to make thoughtful and accurate diagnosis's. 
0.680000	I generally don't trust people, but my primary care doctor seems pretty trustworthy. She tells it straight up and that's important to me.
0.440000	Most doctors have a patients best interest at heart but many have become nothing but car sales man that deal out drugs because of kickbacks and free samples
0.920000	She is very kind.  She is able and willing to answer any questions that I might have about my care.  She has never hesitated to tell me the truth about what is going on, and does it in a way that makes me feel as comfortable as possible.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough. She runs extensive tests when needed and rules out the worst possible scenario first. She takes time to talk with me, explain things and answer questions.
0.400000	I trust him because he is qualified. HIs advices in the past have been good for me. I have benefitted from listening to his advices.
0.840000	I have a new Dr. He has been very thorough to let me know that I have his time and will be upfront and honest when it comes to my medical needs. 
0.640000	I do trust my health care provider enough to hear their advice and opinions, but i truly like to do some added research based off the doctors suggestions to feel more secure in my choice/decision 
0.440000	I don't have a PCP. I  have no insurance so I have to visit clinics and see different nurses, almost never a doctor. I can't think of a time I've seen a doctor. I generally trust the nurses because the conditions I've had are fairly simple to treat. I went in knowing I needed some kind of antibiotic so it was easy to trust the diagnosis. 
0.800000	For the most part I trust my primary care doctor. Sometimes I feel like she is guessing and not really making an effort to help my situation. It seems like a lot of trial and error. I trust that she is getting the most current information to pass along to me. She is usually quick to respond to message also.
1.000000	My doctor has my best interest at heart. Why wouldn't she? If she did something that would cause me harm, she would get in trouble and potentially sued. She is a doctor because she cares about people and wants to help them.
0.520000	My mother is a doctor. I love my mother very much, but I realize that doctors aren't magicians, and they are very much people too. I see her run short on patience for her patients---I see how things like drug seeking behaviour make her suspicious of many patients. I think many doctors probably feel this way, and it makes me wary of trusting them. 
0.800000	I have no reason to believe that they do not care about their work and patients. There would be no reason for them to choose such a demanding career if they did not care. They also would have no reason to self sabotage their career. 
0.480000	sometimes he seems like he does not listen to me, he is kind of quirky and i call him spaceman. i tell him something and he goes on to the next subject like he did not hear what i said.
0.480000	I don't think that my doctor hears what I am saying all of the time.  I also feel like the answer to everything with him is a new medication.  I would prefer to try and solve health issues without medication first.
0.480000	I feel like doctors don't treat you as a person, they treat you by how they judge you when you first come in. They already have you figured out and they won't listen to you no matter what they say. 
0.720000	A primary care physician is a physician who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis. Since recently, the term is primarily used in the United States. In the past in the US and still in the United Kingdom (and in many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is general practitioner.
0.360000	They're out for themselves. Whatever brings in the money to pay off their student loans is what matters, especially the kickbacks from pharmaceuticals . The American people are just cattle strolling into their butcher shop.
0.600000	I dont always trust doctors because I feel like sometimes they just want to give us medicine without being sure what's really wrong.  They also rarely give ideas to help before giving the medicine.
0.960000	I trust my primary physician because I've seen him ever since I was an early teenager. He knows me very well and a lot of my habits both good and bad. He was critical in getting through high school and college with all the necessary vaccines and STD prevention tools, and has always been very open and engaging. It's almost like talking to an old friend where you feel like you can be yourself and open. This really helps in getting across to each other better, and allows him to more easily attune his prescriptions and medical diagnosis' to my situations. I think a lot of people tend to see their doctor as just a means to get medication when they need it, but I think a lot of people fail to realize just how beneficial it can be to have a doctor you trust and is willing to go that extra mile to help you.
0.840000	I trust my PCP a lot. He has been my PCP since I was a teenager. My family have always used him and we kind of feel like his is a friend of the family. He isn't, but it feels that way. He hasn't ever led us wrong and even prevented my father from losing his foot at one point.
0.800000	I've had the same doctor for 16 years, and so far he hasn't given me any reason not to trust him. I have been extremely healthy for all of those years too though so he hasn't had much of a chance to be wrong. Overall I'm comfortable with him, and feel like he does a good job.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician for 100%. We have a relationship for 3 years now where I have been through some health problems. She has always helped me on a basis of honesty and telling me openly what the options wheree. She also gave me a great deal of input in the decisions that had to be made.. 
0.600000	I'm a skeptic by nature, and I know that human beings are prone to making mistakes. However, I trust that my primary physician's medical knowledge is much better than my own, so I respect his judgement and analysis. As with anything, I like evidence and data-based reasons to believe and trust things. As long as he can provide that to me, I'm likely to trust more. Otherwise, I remain skeptical by nature. Even so, I am likely to take his advice even if I disagree with it, if it may end up benefiting me, and the risk is low. If it's a matter of life and death and I don't like his judgement, I may try to find a second or third opinion.
0.800000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY HAVE MORE ACKNOWLEDGES AND MORE EXPERIENCES. I THINK THEY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO HELP ME GET BETTER HEALTH.
0.480000	I typically trust my doctor but there are times that the prescribed treatment seems inadequate. It's good to find a doctor that you like and trust. It takes a while but a doctor that is willing to put time in with you could be a lifesaver.
0.800000	I have had nothing but a stellar experience for 8 years with my primary doctor.She has gone above and beyond her duties when I have concerns, I completely trust her.
0.720000	When talking to others about their experiences with their primary care physician, I know mine is better. My doctor takes what I say seriously and examines them. She makes sure that I take all the necessary tests and she scolds me when she feels that I am not taking my health seriously. I told her that I was having chest pains but that it is probably anxiety or heartburn. She made me that an EKG and based on those results, an ultrasound.
0.840000	I have had no problems in the past with my doctor. He has always been straight forward with me and laid out the different options I have for dealing with medical issues.
0.800000	I feel like most doctors have the patients best interests in mind.  I know some doctors are only here for the pay and try to make money any way possible but, I tend to have a lot of faith in people and trust doctors unless they give me a reason not to.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for years and so has other members of my family. She has always given me the medical advice that I need and I trust her to do what is best for me. She is always open to any questions that I have and is able to explain things that I may not understand. If I happen to not understand she has no problem giving me more info. She tells me if I have any questions to not hesitate to call her. That puts me at ease if I need to call again for anything follow up questions she is there and if she is not there is always another doctor or nurse to help me,
0.800000	I get a strong sense from my physician that he truly listens to me, wants to engage my thoughts, and has my best interests in mind. Moreover, my questions are welcome and his explanations are clear. This is why I trust my physician. 
0.320000	I feel that since the practice I go to has switched/been bought by or covered by a certain medical group, the quality of care has greatly declined, and I've noticed several subtle and some not so subtle changes for the worse. I have gone in so many times trying to figure out what is causing my body some negative problems (pain, easily fatigued, etc) and I just keep getting the run around, it seems. I am considering finding a medical practice that hasn't yet been bought out or taken over by the specific umbrella medical group, which has been difficult. I don't believe that prescription drugs that just bandaid a situation are the answer. I don't like to take a bunch of Rx, and would appreciate some direction from my physicians, but haven't gotten much help in that dept.
0.560000	Doctor are human. As human beings, they have their own personalities and agendas that are not entirely conducive to another persons needs or health. Therefore, their actions and advice require some consideration in the larger picture. One must take responsibility for one's health regardless of another person's opinion of your health. I guess we should all be doctors for our own sake...whether we like it or not.
0.800000	I have a general positive trust for my doctor. I don't think she'd ever intentionally give me misinformation or mislead me. I've never had a concern with this and feel like she's always helpful and informative.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he is not too quick to prescribe drugs.  If there is a natural approach to fix the problem he will give safe suggestions to try before encouraging a drug fix to the problem.  And what he has suggested has worked for the most part.
0.560000	A few years ago, my mother's former cardiologist recommended that she have open heart surgery based on faulty results of an echo cardiogram. He was also not truthful about the surgical options available either. We confirmed this first through internet research, then with a leading heart surgeon at a highly-rated cardiac hospital. The end result was that my mother did not need heart surgery at all and after twice-yearly echo cardiograms with a different cardiologist, still does not require it. I have less drastic but similar experiences in the past with doctors. Unfortunately this has given me a healthy amount of distrust for what I'm initially told. I will always research topics myself, ask many questions and seek 2nd opinions.
0.680000	I have experienced hospital and doctor errors so I am now far more careful.  Those errors were significant -- such as not doing a screen of the chest of my husband when he had head/neck cancer, a failure that impacted the treatment given him.
0.560000	I trust my primary care doctor, but I know that she doesn't know how to deal with my real life problems.  She keeps telling me to go to a counselor, but when that is not an option for your patient, you have to have other options available to them.  She has not been able to help me beyond the basic physical ailments I have.  She is not any help emotionally or able to advise me where I can get the kind of help she thinks I need.  It's a weird situation. 
0.920000	My doctor has never shown me a reason to distrust her. When I visit her, she never makes me wait long, she is timely and responsible to any issues I have. If I call her office for a refill, I never have to make a second call like at some doctor's offices. Her staff are professional and responsive. I am quite happy with my primate care physician.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for almost ten years. She usually takes the time to explain things to me and make sure I am comfortable with the decisions that we make.
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has been my primary doctor for many years. He listens to me and doesn't judge me regardless of my habits. He always tries to provide the best guidance possible.
0.920000	I think there are so many laws now that the doctors and my doctor are very thorough and honest. It also helps he is very kind and respectable. 
0.920000	My primary care provider is always careful in prescribing medication, since I take so many of them (20+ prescription meds). She listens to my concerns, is always thorough in her examination of me, and never makes me feel like I'm just another line item on her checklist. While I've been treated by everyone at the practice, I like her the best.
0.440000	i suspect that doctors in general are influenced by financial interests when recommending treatment options and prescribing medication. i also suspect that many doctors make assumptions without thorough examination sometimes because of heavy workloads or personal bias.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he seems very knowledgeable whenever I need to consult him.  He has been the doctor of my mother and grandparents for a number of years and has always done right by them.  I find that when I communicate clearly with him he is easy to understand and is easily able to diagnose my issue.
1.000000	My doctor has always shown care and concern for me. She has never once brushed aside my feelings or acted as if I was stupid. She has always taken time to answer my questions. 
0.840000	My primary care physician never makes me feel rushed when I have an appointment. She listens to my concerns and always asks if I have questions. I believe she is intelligent and keeps up with new developments in medicine.
0.760000	For the most part, I trust her because she is a doctor and hasn't given me reason not to yet. However... we did just switch doctors and have only seen our current doctor twice. We had to switch due to insurance coverage, but our previous doctor I had been with for 5 years and trusted completely. I hope to develop the same relationship with our current family doctor.
0.240000	I was in extreme pain for a very long time when I finally decided to go to the doctor. I told my doctor where my pain was and how extreme it was. At first she treated me for something way off. Of course I was still very sick and hurting. I went back and told her what she treated me for was not right at all. So she sends me home with a bunch of muscle relaxers which made me sick. After 2 months of trying to follow her patient plan I went back. I begged her to refer me to a specialist and it turned turns out I was right and she was wrong.This is why I do not trust doctors. There are several times when they are wrong.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is kind and competent. They care about me and my health. They are concerned about any issues I have. We have good communication between us as well. She is also very concerned about other parts of my life as well.
0.720000	I don't have a whole of interaction with my primary doc (barely a checkup a year), and not many problems (yet), so there's nothing really controversial I wouldn't trust about her diagnoses and prescriptions. Sometimes she does miss items in my history and wanted to prescribe something that wouldn't be a good idea, but I point this out.
0.680000	I think they have a lot of experience. My primary care giver was in a management position at a hospital in the past so I have confidence that they will do their best to look out for me.
0.720000	Just a level a trust is built up when you see the same doctor for many years and he has always solved problems presented to him. My doctor has been the same my entire life. He even saw my parents when they were younger. I'm fortunate to never have experienced serious medical problems but if I did then I would trust him as getting me on the right track to getting better.
0.440000	I trust most of what my doctor says unless I detect that she is in a rush to get me out of there. I always do my own research to learn different options and to learn about meds before I take them.
0.800000	he is always friendly, upfront about anything I ask him. He always gives me an honest opinion about medications and leaves it up to me if I should take them or not.
0.880000	I have seen my primary care physician for a few years now, and have only seen my health improve during this time. I have had no reason to distrust her or feel that her opinions of me are biased in any way. She has always been open to any questions I have, and has been willing to look at a variety of options for medical issues that I have had, and adjust things based on how I feel. She'll check in to make sure that I've followed up with other appointments as necessary, and I just generally tend to feel that she really cares about her patients. I don't feel like I'm in a rush, and she always treats me like a person, not just part of her job, which I appreciate. I've also looked online and she's had good ratings from other people, as well as working with a highly rated medical group that other members of my family have gone to as well. I feel like she has the resources available to help with any treatment I may need, and has utilized them in the past when she thought some other specialist may be of more help than she is. Prior to this, I didn't have good experiences with doctors. They tended not to listen to my problems, and were quick to make assumptions. In one case, a doctor refused to listen to the fact that I believed I was allergic to a medication I was taking, and I actually ended up in the ER. This current doctor is the first one that I feel listens and is actually willing to help with any issues that I have come up.
0.600000	My physician is quite busy and this can lead him to be curt or even impatient when asked for options or explanations. He normally thorough in his treatment but can get antsy when asked to explain himself or to clarify something he has said. I think he assumes that people will give his schedule as much priority as he does.
0.600000	There is a hidden agenda in the medical practice in which medications are pushed for revenue, this is not necessarily a bad thing but it does make one accept most pill-based medications with a grain of salt.
0.640000	My seemingly distrust for most doctors comes from experiences of people that are close to me. I've seen doctors misdiagnose or treat for wrong illnesses way too often. I've also seen and heard about them prescribing medicine that was unnecessary.
0.800000	"Hard to comment on doctors in general, since I believe a lot of them don't do a lot of research on drugs and were not trained in preventative care outside of ""take this pill."" I try to seek out physicians who are also trained in natural care and prevention. My primary care doctor is Chinese with both a Chinese and US medical degree, but very unconventional. I trust what he says because my overall heath and well being has actually improved. I am 71 with very little degenerative arthritis, normal blood sugar/cholesterol and plaque-free carotid arteries. So I do trust him and the other health specialists that I see"
0.560000	I know that my primary care physician is qualified to do his job, as he has gone through the necessary schooling and training to gain the expertise for his position. However, I also realize that medicinal knowledge is vast, and that doctors only see me for a few minutes and therefore do not have the deep analytical insight that would make me fully trust them.
0.320000	I have repeatedly had issues (not serious) that were not helped by my doctor. I ended up figuring out what would help me, and I got better using alternative or holistic things that completely cleared the issue. I have also been repeatedly prescribed medicine that had severe side effects or addictive qualities, and was not told about it. Because I read - a LOT - I declined to take the meds because of this.
0.800000	My doctor is very willing to spend extra time with me discussing things that I am unclear on or need extra help with. I am able to ask about alternative treatments or additional ideas on how to get better when I am sick or injured. He listens without judgement and shows that he cares.
0.760000	I trust my doctor and have a lot of faith in her. I like it that she is a primary care as well as internist.
0.720000	He is highly regarded by those close to me. A lot of friends and family use the same doctor, and have high praise for him as well. 
0.400000	"It seems like doctors are more interested in seeing as many patients as they can in a day than taking time to really think about what a patient is telling them. It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor who didn't seem rushed and eager to hurry up and go on to the next patient. I think because of this they are quick to farm us out to specialists for things that primary care doctors used to be able to take care of in their own offices, and to make snap judgements about a person's condition rather than take the time to think about what else could be wrong. More and more of them will even tell you whatever is wrong is ""stress"" or that they can't find anything wrong with you, but later if you see another doctor they DO find something legitimately wrong."
0.640000	My previous doctor let this practice and the partner is now my doctor.  As far as I know he is dependable but I haven't actually seen him for anything.  I see a nurse practitioner when I go there and she is very nice and helpful.  The office is nice and professional so I am assuming the doctor is similar to the other characteristics of the office.
0.760000	In my experywith him he never made any decision or recommended any medical decision that was not for my best
0.640000	I trust my doctor in that he listens to my concerns and takes my suggestions into consideration. He is a newer doctor to me and knows I have been dealing with certain heath issues for a while.
1.000000	"I trust my doctor because she gives me answers without ""sugar coating"" anything, she tells me how good or bad things really are. She gives me options as far as what kind of medicines I should take, like how I want to only take medicine in the evening and not any in the morning. If something is not right for me she is very willing to have me try something else. She is not one of those doctors that always has to be right, with rigid opinions. She is flexible and willing to work with me."
0.920000	I have had the same doctor for awhile now so i just know her really well and feel comfortable enough with her to trust her
0.560000	I trust him generally because he does help me a lot. but at the end of the day it is a profession and he needs to make money so sometimes i feel he is in a rush to get to the next patient. that could just be me though also he seems to quick to prescribe meds
0.600000	My new doctor is usually very good so I trust him well. However, I feel that doctors in general tend to push certain drugs  even when there are better options available. For instance I have asthma and my doctor pushed a certain inhaler that was more expensive than a cheaper, better option.
0.520000	"I have a lot of medical conditions that I've had most of my life, but I have overlooked because my parents told me they were normal. They were not. Now that I'm talking to my doctor about them I feel as though he thinks I'm a hypochondriac and doesn't take me seriously. I've had chronic soreness my entire life. He doesn't believe me. There are a few conditions that are more ""modern"" that he just doesn't believe in. "
0.880000	My primary care physician treats me as a person she knows and about my well being physically spiritually emotionally and psychology.  She is very calm but direct and thoughtful. 
0.800000	My primary care doctor has always put my best interest first. He listens to my concerns and all my symptoms makes sure I have all the appropriate test ran in a timely matter and fully explains everything to me.
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for almost 4 years now, give or take, and he has always been a very very truthful, and integrity based person. He tells it how it is, and he is a doctor who doesn't like to just prescribe medication and be over with it. He takes the time to sit and talk to figure out exactly what the problem is, and if some type of medication is needed or absolutely necessary he will prescribe it. Otherwise we find different ways of dealing with it or try a lower tier of medication than something that could be addictive or hazardous to health. He is a genuine doctor and I have never had any issues with him.
0.640000	I know that he is very busy with a lot of patients, so maybe he just jumps to a treatment that  he thinks might work. For instance, I used to have a lot of digestive issues and such, and I don't think he asked once what my diet was like. Instead, he put me on pills for depression. Don't get me wrong, I needed those as well, but looking back, I think diet had a lot to do with it as well.
0.760000	I have been with them through multiple appointments and issues. He looks out for what is the best for me, and I trust him and his diagnosis. He has soothed my worries and worked to make sure I am helahty. I have complete trust
0.800000	She spends the time necessary to make sure I understand everything we talk about and about treatment options.  She herself always calls me with test results and asks if I have any questions.  She never makes me feel rushed. 
0.880000	My doctor is honest and open with me. He seems to provide all options regarding care and doesn't refrain from telling me things that may be difficult for me to hear. 
0.960000	My doctor has been my primary care physician for over 20 years. Sometimes, she does seem to rush, but not often. She's been there for me through illnesses and injuries and always taken care of me.
0.760000	My doctors will take the time to research a problem if they're not familiar with it.  They always make sure that I have all the information needed to make an informed decision about any medical conditions that come up. I go to a doctor's office that has multiple doctors in it and don't always see the same one, so it's important to me that they look over my records and are basically on the same page as far as any care is concerned.  We live in a rural area and the doctors communicate with each other in a thorough manner.  When you are referred to a specialist they always get complete information on your condition which saves time for all parties involved.  
0.400000	I don't have a primary car physician.  I haven't had one in over a decade.  My doctor left the practice and I was switched to someone else without my knowledge or opinion and then they moved to a different location and 'lost' me as a patient and wasn't accepting new patients.  I've always left appointments feeling like I'd been let down in my interactions with doctors.  
0.640000	I trust my doctor to an extent because she has her own motives as well. Sometimes nothing is wrong  but she is addresses it because she wants the additional money, something she admitted to my husband who works in her office. So, I feel that all doctors probably think the same way. So, I could be worrying about an issue because my doctor, who already gets paid very well, wanted more money.
0.560000	I really try and put faith into what they are telling me.  I have been known to challenge them somewhat if the diagnoses does not make any sense to me.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he hasn't really given me a reason not to. He's very receptive to what I think is wrong with me and is very thorough in explaining what I am suffering from. He also explains his choices as to how to treat and explains why my initial thought of my reason for coming is wrong without being condescending.
0.800000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. She hasn't let me down and I don't feel like I'm not getting the care I go in for.
0.760000	One of the reasons is because the physician seeks to find ways or things that are beneficial. Sometimes certain information is held back for the sake of not telling everything in order to gain more power that gives the physician the upper hand. That is my speculation based on a lot of things that are taking place today. 
0.800000	She is very thorough in her exams and tests for everything. I would rather someone be too thorough and have nothing come up than slack off and miss something. She is very knowledgeable and has not given me a reason to distrust her. She reviews side effects of medications thoroughly and even goes over medications that have been prescribed to me by other doctors. 
0.600000	It is not that I do not trust my primary care physician, it's just that I am not sure he is giving me the best information or just the information he gives to everyone.
0.600000	There have been mistakes made with my care that have resulted in a need for more medical services.  I am somewhat jaded with respect to receiving medical care.  
0.880000	"I trust my primary care physician. He is always available via the electronic portal and will respond to me within hours, sometimes even on the weekend. Sometimes an initial treatment plan won't work, but he is always ready with ""plan B"". He also makes sure I'm on schedule with preventative care (physicals, etc.)"
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he has always steered me right and will do his best to avoid putting me through a procedure that I don't actually need. While he could make more money doing so, he will be honest with me in telling me whether or not I need something done or not. 
0.760000	Well I trust them because I expect them to be professionals and know what they're talking about. But at the same time I have gotten second opinions and wouldn't hesitate to do so again in the future because it's always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.
0.760000	I have been under this doctor's care for over 10 years.  He inherited me as a patient from my previous physician, who retired. I was one of his first patients and we have become friends.  I have learned to trust him, and have never found his diagnostic instincts to be in error.  He knows when to treat me for a problem, and when to leave me alone.  He is a kind human being and a good physician.
0.720000	I trust my PCP because she is fairly thorough.  When I explain to her that I have a specific medical concern, she does what she can to address it.  If I ask for a test or procedure, she does whatever she can to make it happen, which helps to allay my fears.  She makes appointments for me in a timely fashion, and she seems to actually care about my issues.  That's not to say she isn't usually in a hurry, but I think most doctors are because of a large patient load.
0.440000	"I often feel like doctors care more about their time and money that the patient. It can be difficult to talk in depth about medical problems because my doctor is looking for a ""quick fix"" rather than a long term solution."
0.760000	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician. I believe that they are the most capable person to diagnose and treat my medical conditions and that they have my best interests in mind.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physicians because we have a mutual trust of respect and friendliness. I find that if I empathize with them and ask then questions in a friendly manner, they are always eager to listen and advise me best on how to proceed.
0.880000	My doctor always tells me their opinion and their level of confidence. They give me options if they are available.
0.920000	My primary care physician has been honest and helpful in my decisions regarding my health.  Even though my last blood work showed I was nearing a diabetic level, I was very concerned that she wanted to put me on Metformin.  I chose not to add this medicine into my body and wanted to change my diet instead.  She approved my decision and suggested that we re-do the blood work in 3 months.  I am getting ready to make my 3 month appointment for Monday.
0.760000	My doctor is very thorough and I am pretty confident in her abilities as a doctor. I have gone to her for many different ailments I have had and she has always prescribed or ordered the right tests for me.
0.680000	I trust my doctor for the most part but they aren't the most open minded when it comes to alternative therapies.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I believe he cares.   He seems down to earth and he showed concern when he saw I had too high amounts of cholesterol in my blood.   Also he seems to provide good advice that has helped me in the past. 
0.680000	I don't know my primary care physician very well, so have developed complete trust in her. She's new to me, as my previous physician left for a job in another community and no longer is in my insurance network. Therefore, I am back to rebuilding trust in a physician.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because would have built a relationship over many years. I have come to trust them and their decisions regarding my healthcare. I always consult them in health related matters. 
0.920000	I have been to the doctor many times in the past and there has never really ben any issues.  I have been provided good information and treated the way I would want to be treated.  There has been no reason to not trust him in the past so I will continue to trust until proven otherwise.
0.720000	I feel doctors are too drug orientated and therefore I tend to distrust their judgement if it does not include alternative or natural treatments. As I have experienced a lot of success in treating my own health issues naturally without drugs I tend to refuse any advice from a doctor that relies heavily on drugs.
0.520000	I feel like sometimes he's in a rush and just wants to move on to the next patient.  He addresses issues but I don't feel like he's being thorough and thinking through his answers.
0.720000	I prefer to trust my PCP because they can come up with the diagnosis of what's wrong with me and can prescribe me the right medication or other additional help that I need. They have more experience in their field and should be good at what they do. 
0.400000	I have advanced lung disease and I often feel that the doctor has not taken the time to really look over my files and/or learn about my condition.   For example, he recommended the Shingles vaccine for me and I had to inform him that because I am on steroids I cannot have the vaccine.
0.720000	I do not have a primary care physician anymore so I will just go with my neurologist.When I started going to her I was on all the wrong medicines all of my Drs before her were just throwing pills at me hoping for the best, I was even on a medication that was so outdated they only prescribed for cases where nothing else would work. She changed all of that in just one visit by putting me on all new medication. She even took care of my constant headaches and other little issues that I thought where just there for life.
0.840000	My doctor has made efforts to connect with other doctors treating me for various issues, and she spends as much time as necessary with me during appointments.
0.800000	Before she retired, I had a good relationship with my former primary care.  She was very open with me and worked with me to better my help.  I really trusted her.  Now she is gone and I'm back at square one with no one I trust.
1.000000	I completely trust m doctor! She is very kind and compassionate. She always takes the time to listen to my concerns carefully. She will in turn offer her professional advice to me. She even stays around to have a few minutes of small talk when we are finished. She's absolutely great! 
0.680000	My primary care physician asks questions that implies they're trying to dig deeper into my symptoms to see what is wrong. They run tests that may help figure out what's wrong with me.
0.400000	"I have gone to see my doctor about trouble i am having that had nothing to do with my weight, however he will always tell me something about ""loosing weight will make you feel better"" or connect everything to my weight. I already know loosing weight will make me feel better, i have lost 81 pounds and feel alot better, but can you please just help me with the problem i actually came in for! Speaking of loosing weight, he has tried several times to convince me that i should change my diet from eating moderate protein and high fat, to something that includes more vegetables. Meanwhile when i was a vegetarian i was still pre diabetic and overweight, but now that i only eat meat i am no longer a risk for getting diabetes, as a doctor i would think he would be convinced by that proof, but he still tries to convince me i am wrig and tries to get me to take meds i don't think i need."
0.360000	Doctors are nothing more than amateur golfers who are also sales reps for pharmaceutical companies. They could care less about patient care and well being. They are only interested in getting you on prescription medications and having you come in to their office as often as possible while doing nothing beyond billing you and your insurance companies.
0.680000	I think that doctors in general have my best interests in mind when I see them for a problem that I am having. But the trouble with healthcare is that it is a for profit entity and the cost and profit side of it always comes into play.
0.760000	My primary care physician shows a genuine interest in me. She shows that she cares about health, calories, weight and healthy food. I trust her.
0.880000	I have only seen my doctor a few times since we moved to Kentucky but she seems to be very upfront and honest about things.  She also has to be just about one of the kindest people that I have met since moving here.  
0.320000	I canât get a straight answer from my doctor.  I feel that he is vague and afraid to commit to an answer. It makes it hard to trust doctors in general.
0.600000	I think that doctors are humans...they make mistakes. While my dr may have the best intentions, he can make mistakes too. I therefore, trust myself and how I am currently feeling and what I think is best for my body over his opinion of everyday issues that may come up. 
1.000000	My doctor always has my best interest at heart. He will listen to my concerns and do what we both feel necessary to help the situation. My doctor will explain the pros and cons with me and together help me decide my best option.
0.760000	I trust my Doctor because whenever I felt anxious or had doubts about my medical condition she was always available. She always gave me reassurance when I needed it.
0.640000	I feel like I can trust my doctor to listen to me and answer my questions correctly.  However, if I forget something or don't ask the question correctly I fell like things have or will be missed.  This has happened.  I do so much of my own research before appointments I try and make sure that I pretty much already know the answers and he just confirms or corrects.
0.840000	My doctor has always fully explained things to me in a nice way. He's never belittled me or made me feel unintelligent. He's fun, thorough and thoughtful. I would recommend him to anyone. 
0.400000	My primary care physician does not know me well as a person or patient. I believe I am more of a number than a patient. My doctor is quick to prescribe medication.
0.600000	My doctor understands my pain an what I need she talks to me for hours an dose her job right I believe in are 100%
0.520000	My current primary care physician is only concerned about getting my appointments over with. I don't have time to talk about issues with her and doesn't inform me about my health. I'm searching for a new physician because I do not have trust in my current one.
1.000000	My doctor is amazing. We have a great relationship and I fully trust her to tell me the truth and to go over everything with me.
0.840000	My doctor always gives it to me straight. He doesn't dance around or mince words.  I trust him for that. He's always open and gives options and opinions about the options. O respect him for that. 
0.760000	My GP listens to me and trusts my intelligence. He knows I don't like to take medication unnecessary medications and that I only call if something is very wrong. He's an amazing diagnostician. 
0.680000	Everyone makes mistakes and often there are multiple treatment options for a given condition.  So, while I do feel that I can trust my Doctor I don't rely on them completely without understanding the full situation.  I like to ask them what they would do, or if their loved one had the same issue what would be the top two treatments they would recommend.
0.600000	I feel that it is neutral when you first meet your doctor but as sessions go on, it is very important for you to be able to talk to your doctor and for them to truly care.
0.480000	Itâs not that I feel that doctors are intentionally wrong or misleading. In most cases Iâm sure they arenât. But medicine in general is so nuanced that Iâve found when I visit a dr for something I gain little to no actual help or improvements and often just end up trying their advice to little help. I feel like Iâm playing dr roulette every visit. Usually I just end up with a bill and no new help or information and often also have to get referred to another dr cause drâs are so specialized nowadays that you canât just visit one dr for most things. So that just increases my bills, wares my time and creates stress. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor as much as possible while realizing she is human and makes mistakes. My doctor asks open-ended questions and allows me to express my concerns openly.  She talks to me about different options I have regarding treatment.  I never feel like she is rushed or in a hurry to get to her next patient. 
0.960000	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for 5 years now. I've had Type 2 Diabetes follow-ups regularly every 3 months for that period of time. The staff in his doctor's office are always very nice, kind, and polite. They're efficient, knowledgeable, and patient. My primary care physician himself is very knowledgeable on just about any condition you may bring up to him. He's always been honest about my health, suggested non-medical ways to address said problem, suggested medical ways to address said problem if non-medical wasn't enough or not appropriate for me personally, and been personable in a professional way. 
0.440000	I don't have a regular primary care physician but in general towards doctors I do not have complete faith in them. The few times that I have had to take either myself or my child to an emergency room, the doctor completely missed something that was extremely important. Most think that you are drug seeking and ignore what could be going on. There are times I trust their judgement but I will speak up if I believe that they are wrong or not being as thorough as I think they should be. 
0.960000	I trust my PCP because I work with them and for them on a daily basis and i know that thehy care about each and everyone of their patietnts. I trust them to give me the right options and recommendations about my care.
0.600000	I trust my doctor but they are human and can sometimes get things wrong. I know they are well educated and are looking out for my best interest. 
0.560000	I trust my doctor because I have no one else I can trust. I live a lonely life. I know that he is one of the only people that I interact with daily who does not wish to inflict some sort of harm (bodily or otherwise) on me. Doctor client privilege also makes me feel very safe with the medical staff that assist me at the hospital, so I know that anything i say can be documented in complete confidence. 
0.680000	"i believed all doctors Truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard.[1] Truth may also often be used in modern contexts to refer to an idea of ""truth to self,"" or authenticity. Truth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, and religion"
0.800000	My doctor is very nice but also tells me exactly like it is. She does not go over board on testing, but provides what is necessary and I don't have to second guess what she is telling me. She allows me to ask questions and voice any concerns I may have and also thinks about how costly things would be for me.
0.800000	All doctors to me should be trusted until they've done something wrong. They wouldn't be in their position if they weren't given trust to start. I'm not saying ALL should be trusted, but all should be given a fair chance!
0.760000	I trust my Primary Care Dr because I have been his patient for 25+ years and he knows me well. While I have never had to disagree with procedures or meds that he prescribes, I believe that if I were to be diagnosed with cancer, he and I may not agree on a treatment. Overall I do not trust most Drs. because of the government involvement and influence on things like prescrition drugs, chemo and their motives for prescribing many things.
0.480000	I don't like it when I go to the doctor and they can't find out what is wrong with me so they just contribute it to something else without getting down to what is causing my problems. I always thought that the doctors were there to look into things and find a cause and help to make it better, but now it seems they are only here to collect big paychecks whether they help a person or not.
1.000000	He's very blunt, like house level blunt. he may not be polite or kind or caring, but he knows the healthcare field and medicine. He has no problem saying it how it is and doesn't fancy foot around it.
0.520000	I haven't gone to this new doctor as much and it takes time to build up trust and believing in the professional. Too many doctors get bought out by pharmaceutical companies and leave out some other medications that could help you if need be. I am not all conspiracy gung ho but I need time to build trust
0.920000	I do trust my primary care physician. He has helped me through some trying times and has given me more time,during visits, than I expected and more than I have been given in the past by other physicians.
0.960000	I trust my ankle surgeon because he actually screwed up a surgery.  It was not something he did as much as my body reacted poorly to the procedure.  He went step by step with me as to how to fix the problem and what lingering issues I would have.  He is always up front and direct but polite with me. 
0.800000	I have gone to him for several years.  He tells it like it is, and doesn't sugar coat it.  When I have concerns I bring them to his attention and he discusses it with me.  I'm an overall healthy person, and see him twice per.  If I am in there outside of the every six months, he knows something is really wrong.
0.800000	He is very thorough in running tests to make sure I am healthy.  I feel confident in his ability to answer any questions I have.  He takes the time to sit and talk directly with me about any concerns that I have.  He is very patient and I feel concerned about my well being.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because she seems genuinely interested in my concerns when I ask questions. When there is something I need to do, she gives me options that are based in real, conventional medicine and doesn't try to brush me off by suggesting placebo-like alternative treatments. She seems cautious and checks my lab results, and will take some time to see if my concern is based on an injury or illness during an exam. If something seems like it will clear up on its own, like some pains, she will suggest contacting her office if it doesn't get better in a certain number of days or weeks. I like her style of care and her advice is almost always a good way forward.
0.920000	I've had the same doctor for many years and I can fully say this man does truly care about his patients. He has a very good memory and understanding of what his patient's need. That is why I put a lot of trust in him.
0.600000	The pay cash to see my doctor.  I honestly believe he is running the clinic he has for the money.  I do believe he understands the way I feel about my condition because he's experienced the same problems I have, yet I still think he is more worried about money than he is the actual welfare of his patients and their recoveries.
0.760000	:I trust my primary care physician because for the most part, they have always given me reliable information. They seem to be very knowledgeable about the conditions I am facing and experienced with those conditions. The take their time in delivering the best care possible to me.
0.840000	I generally trust the doctors that I see because I respect their knowledge and experience. This is particularly true when I see specialists about a particular condition. I have faith when seeing a specialist that they have seen many patients with my condition and that they will be able to quickly find a cure or method to manage the condition. I also try to use this opportunity to ask general questions about the condition to them, which I believe is more informative than if I searched online on my own.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I my family and I have been going to the same one for many years.  She has helped me manage many things including my blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Also she is very up to date on my medications in which I need to order.
0.840000	I trust him because I have a lot of experience with doctors due to a heart problem I had several years ago. I know he is conscientious and thorough and he presents all the alternatives to me.
0.600000	I feel very neutral about my trust towards my primary car physician. I can not whole heartedly put all my faith into them. That why I strive to get second opinions if something does go wrong. I go see a specialist in order to better understand, and make sure I am not being misdiagnosed. There have been instances when I do not believe my doctor has made the right decision such as not prescribing the right dosage of a medication, and I have struggled to come to terms with that. Until then I still go cause its a convenient location, and accepts my insurance.
0.720000	She's a professional, she seems to be pretty knowledgeable and she seems really caring.  I just kind of assume that most doctors know what they are doing, so I do not see why my doctor would be any different.
0.840000	I trust that he has my best interests in mind, he usually presents me with options for any concerns/issues I have and encourages me to do my own research into those options to ensure I can make a fully informed decision. He takes his time during our visits to explain to me what I need to know, and almost always request that I follow up with him in a timely manner to ensure I am on a recommended path towards meeting any goals/treatments that have been selected.
0.760000	For the most I trust my physician. I do think that doctors need to spend more time with there patients. 
0.680000	I trust that they care about the patients. They seem to want what is best for us and provide all the options. There are more effective doctors out there though I'm sure. They can still be wrong, or overlook something, especially if they are overworked.
0.520000	I sometimes trust them because they give good solutions, and sometimes I never get the right cure. Also some doctors tend to be very well behavied and this gives me some more trust because they judge the case as if this is their case.
0.560000	I think that people are often motivated by money and that sometimes doctors will not tell people the best way to take care of themselves but they will tell them what is most convenient and beneficial to themselves instead. 
0.840000	My doctor has been my PCP for years and I trust him. I don't get sick often, but when I do he hits the nail on the head with the diagnosis. He listens and I feel he truly cares about my well being
0.480000	Unfortunately, medical care in America is a business first.  I never know if the decisions my doctor is making are in my best interest or the best interest for his bottom line.
0.840000	In my experience, with all the conditions I have gone through in my life and went to the doctor, all the information they have given me had proof that I had found out prior to visiting.
0.760000	"I trust my primary care physician for the following reasons: She is always attentive and shows interest in my line of questioning when it comes to description of symptoms, inquiries with regards to preventative maintenance (i.e. discussing future concerns based on age, family history as it relates to my current health, etc.). I never feel rushed during a routine visit when it comes to discussing concerns and overall health strategies. Overall, I feel that she cares about my well-being. My main distrust point with my primary care physician is the ""physical"" side of routine examinations. I feel like she is less comprehensive during the exam than my prior physician with regards to tests and covering all aspects of the exam. This is an additional concern now that I am older and more susceptible to common problems (e.g. enlarged prostate, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)."
1.000000	My doctor knows that I will seek outside information about any conditions that he may be treating to make sure that I am informed. Therefore, he is thorough in his explanations and makes sure that I have the pros and cons before I make a decision.
0.920000	He is thorough and talks to me at length about my conditions.  He is focused on my health.  He works me in whenever I need to talk to him and we can have an appointment that is long if I feel I need it.  And he has done great things for my health and is very intelligent.
0.560000	I feel that my doctor knows  enough to trsut him but sometimes its okay to get a second opionon to be srure
0.920000	From my overall history with doctors, I trust my current doctor almost completely. She is young and I haven't had her for long (about 2 years), which is why she doen't have my complete trust yet. She does care about me and my health and is very thorough in her assessments. I am very pleased to have her.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for several years. He has proven over time that he wants to keep me healthy. He has never diagnosed me incorrectly so I have no reason to believe he is lazy or incompetent. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because that is their job to know what is going on. I have not had an interaction yet with a doctor where I feel they were not doing their part to help me understand something. I sometimes think some doctors care more about things they need to be doing than the patient themselves but maybe these particular doctors are more on the research side of things as opposed to patient facing.
0.800000	My doctor makes sure to let me know what is going on if there is anything going on and makes sure I understand everything they do as they do it. My doctor makes sure that my thought are heard when I have a questions or comment and makes sure that they understand ever question I have. 
0.400000	I often feel like my doctor is so busy that I am just another body walking through a room to hurry on their way. I often feel like my problems aren't big enough or interesting enough to warrant being given full attention.
0.720000	I've had the same doctor for approximately 10 years, he's always helpful and knowledgeable. Provides me with answers and comforts my concerns but every visit feels more and more rushed like they are squeezing in more patients than time. It's like you are leading the visit by talking non-stop so he doesn't run away to the next.
1.000000	I answered in regard to my doctor of 30+ years who recently retired. I absolutely trusted him with my children, whom he delivered, and myself. He always turned out to be right, always listened and explained things, gave me options. I have not seen a different doctor yet because I lost my job and do not have any health insurance.
0.800000	I have been knowing him for a long time.  I know how he works.  He has good online reviews.  He is a good listener.
0.600000	some doctors are just wrong with the diagnosis and treatment.  Some treatments are very difficult to accomplish by me.  Some doctors just order them and don't give a thought as to how hard it is on the client
0.480000	I don't feel as though my doctor knows me or cares that much about my well being in particular. I think he sees me just as any other patient. I think that can become dangerous because then the doctor applies a one size fits all type mentality. 
0.800000	My doctor is caring and shows genuine concern for my well being.  She is thorough and answers any questions that I may have.  She takes her time and is very good at what she does. 
0.480000	Some medical decisions are not 100% safe. And I prefer to do all natural remedies first before having to pump toxins in my body that can cause more harm than good. They have some good options but half the time without tests, they are guessing. 
0.800000	I completely trust my doctor as I have known her for a long time, and she is also a friend of the family. She is highly regarded by her peers and the medical community in general. She is very professional, honest, and kind.
0.920000	I always make sure the doctor I am dealing with is trustworthy. They usually have rules in place to make sure I am getting a fair deal, and if not, I can always find someone else or complain about them to the office/hospital. I have never had a bad experience at the doctor's office, and I can tell by their personality that they are taking care of me and have me in their best interests.
1.000000	My doctor always makes sure to involve me in the decisions of my care. He always makes sure to ask if I have any questions. He spends an appropriate amount of time discussing my health with me and the reasons he is making the decisions he is. He always provides information about medications possible side effects.
0.840000	I think sometimes doctors focus too much on pharmaceutical prescriptions to mask problems when it would be wiser to get to the underlying problem. In general, though, their solutions to help and can help someone who is getting or is sick.
0.560000	I feel that they usually know what they are doing but you can't expect them to care deeply about you because they see so many people that can't care about each one a great deal. Doctors work long hours and make mistakes because they are human so you need to watch what they do and say carefully to as a mistake they make can cause a good deal of harm to you or possibly death. Doctors are also going to lie from time to time as again they are human., in my experience doctors also have an over inflated ego which can cause problems as they are less likely to second guess their decisions.
0.600000	While I believe doctors are a trustworthy lot, in general, I am also aware that doctors see many patients per day and treatment options are constantly changing. Doctors may not be fully aware of the latest developments in medicine. Recently published studies showing adverse reactions to conventional treatments may not be foremost in a doctors mind while treating her patients.
0.840000	I trust doctors because they seem very open to discuss questions and concerns. Even to the point of not wanting to take prescribed medicine they will refer to other alternatives. 
0.640000	I believe most doctors can be trusted in giving you the best advise available to you. The problem with doctors in the US, is they do not have enough time to spend with patients. They are usually in a rush to get you out of the office, so they can see the next patient. 
0.800000	i had a few good doc in my life they were was honest about my diansoses.helped in any way they could.understood my phobias oh i forgot to menction i have anemia too.
0.640000	i currently have a great pa but often see neurologists and i know i need aggressive doctors and for the most part have been satisfied. i am an odd example of ms and have needed unusual treatment. 
0.200000	"For one, I don't have insurance and live well below the poverty level, so I don't have a PCP. Medical care is in an emergency only. But, when I did have a PCP and insurance, my doctors were in the room for 5 minutes or less and just gave a dx as whatever was the fastest and most convenient thing at the time. Also, I have a mental health history, so anything they couldn't explain or dx, they just attributed to me being ""mentally unstable""."
0.680000	I've been through many doctors and can understand that some are to be trusted less since they may diagnose you with something that nets them alot of money if you dont understand your own issue. Sometimes you may be a test subject for a new disease that makes alot of money for them and you have to go through a lot of bullshit just because you dont know whats wrong. I trust my primary care physician quite a bit since its more of a help me help you situation, but generally they're still a second opinion.
0.680000	I trust my PCP because they are good at explaining situations with my health and laying out options. I am skeptical whether ALL possibilities are considered, but I am confident that the most likely scenarios are addressed first. 
0.520000	I don't think my doctor has 'bad intentions' towards me or any of the other patients in general, but I do think that It's just a job to him. In a hurry to get to lunch, and in a hurry to get on with his day like anyone else when they work that much.
0.800000	I trust my physician because my friend and my friends mom were her patients. They went to a school i am familiar with . They have always explain everything and provided care for me. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor but I realize that sometimes a problem needs a different viewpoint. I think that my doctor does the best she can but sometimes a problem needs an expert in a different field. I trust my doctor to admit this and move me on to see that person. I think that my doctor has my best interest in mind when she makes decisions related to my health. 
0.920000	I know that my doctor wants to do all he can to make me well.  He gives me options for natural medicine and regular medicine. I know he is a Christian and that also makes me feel better about my care.
0.720000	i have to trust them becuace they are looking out for my welfare. when dont follow instructions they why would i go see them.sometimes i think they dont understand the problem i have and i might second guess thier reasoning behind what they say
0.600000	I do not really fully trust any doctor that much since sometimes whatever is affecting me cannot be solved by my doctors. 
0.600000	I currently don't have a PCP and haven't even gone to a doctor in over 3 years. I do have problems with depression and anxiety and was being seen at a mental health clinic up until about 6 months ago when they refused to re-new my medications because I was unable to pay the copays that I owed them.
0.840000	I have been with the same doctor through every health issue and this doctor has always listened and understood everything along the way. I could talk to him about anything.
0.840000	Physicians spend years and years honing their craft, learning their skills, and making rational decisions about what to do in any given medical scenario. I don't feel that it's my place to question their advice, so generally they know what the best course of action is. I have full trust in what my care provider tells me I should do.
0.880000	She is always there for me. She lets me know important information about my health. She answers all my questions with patience.
0.760000	I believe that she is kind and caring and will use her best judgement in my treatment. Obvious she does not know everything about me but she tries to get to know me as best she can. 
0.720000	I trust my primary physician because I know my physician for more than a decade and he has demonstrated competency and a caring about my medical needs.  
0.800000	I think sometimes Physicians are in a hurry. So it is to their advantage to gloss over your case. So instead of carefully considering your case they just take care of the obvious and move on to the next patient.
0.640000	I sometimes dont trust medical professionals because like most other people they are just trying to do the bare minimum in their jobs to get by. Sometimes they don't care for the patients as much as they do the money they are making. 
0.520000	I think doctors are overworked and even though they might know the best thing to do, they might not have time to really consider what is best for you. They also cannot possibly keep up with all of the things they need to when it comes to research or making sure the best things for the patients arent changing.
0.880000	I have known my physician for a very long time. He was my family doctor for my entire life. He has always had good solutions to all of my problems. He has never failed my family in any aspect. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because everything he has told me has improved my quality of life. I have yet to experience anything bad and his knowledge is evident at first glance.
0.480000	I have self diagnosed before I go to the dr. and had to push for the dr to ask for a test . That was contrary to his diagnosis. He then did the test and I was  correct. It was very frustrating !
0.800000	About 12 years ago I had major heart surgery due to life threatening conditions.  I have had chronic conditions since, and my care requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.  My doctor saved my life then, and my care has continued to be thorough and effective.  I have never been dissatisfied in the least with any outcomes from my doctor or provider.
0.800000	My doctor is open, funny, and easy to approach.  I enjoy my doctor and don't feel nervous asking my doctor questions pertaining to my health.
0.800000	He listens to what I say and asks questions to clarify. He remembers from visit to visit small details about my health issues. He does additional research when needed.
0.560000	I do trust my doctor but to a sense. Sometimes I feel like he just wants to hurry me out of the room to go on to the next patient. When I try to explain something that might be wrong he kind of dismisses it. But I do know that he will try to help out for issues that are already present.
0.720000	My doctor has gone to great lengths to help me. I am always confident that they know what they are doing or are at least trying to help. This is why I keep going to them.
0.760000	I generally trust my primary care physician.  Sometimes, there are things he does that's unclear at first but he's usual thorough in terms of explaining things. 
0.680000	I definitely depend on my primary care doctor but I do know enough when to seek out a specialist.  I'm very fond of my doctor but I always question medical decisions.
0.760000	Trust my primary care doctor because they have my best intentions at heart and they are highly esteemed in their profession. They get good results and give thorough advice and council.
0.640000	I occasionally feel rushed when interacting with doctors. Although I know they make an effort to be efficient with their time, I sometimes feel as if they are sacrificing quality for efficiency.
0.200000	I distrust physicians in general. I believe that they are strongly misinformed and guided by big pharma. They are told to prescribe things and they don't do their own research.They just take what the pharma representative says as fact. 
0.880000	I trust my physician because she takes the time to explain potential problems and my own research has given me no reason to distrust her information.
0.560000	I feel like my doctor is quick to recommend pharmaceutical drugs for everything I have and go through. I don't like this approach, I like to do things naturally so when he suggests things, I lose a little trust. I also feel like this is generally all doctors. I think they get kickbacks for the medications they prescribe, so it makes me much less trusting of their motives.
0.520000	I trust a doctor's medical knowledge but not a doctor's character or infallibility. A doctor can make mistakes even if they try their best, they can have beliefs that influence their medical advice, they can be influenced by prejudices or incentives. Doctors are only human. But that doesn't mean I should ignore what they say.
0.920000	Overall, I trust in my doctor because of her confidence and demeanor. She has always been extremely kind, full of information, and has let me know of alternatives if there are any. A primary example was when she prescribed me anti depression medication last year. They worked well, and she made me feel confident that they would help with my situation. 
0.800000	I have had good reviews from other patients who are my friends, and longtime patients of my doctor. He has never made me felt rushed and answered all my questions to my satisfaction.
0.560000	I think Doctors can get in the habit of following the same treatment plan over and over. Each person is different and should have their treatment tailored to them. 
0.720000	My last Primary care physician was a confident man that could answer my questions and was very receptive to any suggestions or bringing up other forms of care. 
0.600000	I think in medicine, having some room for reservations is good, and second opinions are good as well. I think after taking classes with some of the next generations med students...makes me question them as well. They are people just like me. 
0.600000	I trust my doctors to a point. I do not trust them completely and feel they sometimes choice the easier way than the way that might be more beneficial to me. 
0.680000	I have always had good interaction with my primary care physician and feel like i can trust them with all of medical needs.  This person does not judge me and gives advice for all things that i come to them with.  I have never had a reason not to trust this person. 
0.480000	I do not believe that he spends enough time with me to really get to know me. He has given me drugs which help a little, but never asked me in depth about my chronic pain or fatigue, nor has he referred me to a specialist who could.
0.920000	I've had my doctor for 10 years now.  He was my fathers doctor for over 20 years and he also treats my sister.  He's kind, very smart and has a lot of experience.  He's always willing work me into his schedule even if it means skipping his lunch or staying late.  So yeah, I trust him completely.
0.680000	I like that my primary care physician usually presents me with multiple courses of action to take for different problems (i.e. different medications).  However, it comes across as being a little indecisive sometimes when I'd rather have a straight yes or no kind of answer.  He also is quick to recommend a specialist instead of giving a medical opinion himself. Overall I think he is trustworthy, though maybe overly cautious.
0.800000	The particular doctor I currently have takes her time during visits. She asks questions about my life, my family, and the current condition I'm experiencing. I've told my wife I believe my doctor sees me as a project, her goal is to keep me heathy and strong. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician. Because he went to school to gain knowledge to help people and I truly believe he trys to do what he thinks is the best to help me and learn what will be the best to help other people as well sometimes doctors have to try different approaches to get the best outcome that will help each individual overall. 
0.400000	Physicians in this day and age are governed by insurance companies and regulations more than medicine and science.  They don't always willingly do these things, but nonetheless they have to bow down to these entities in order to get paid by using less effective treatments first, or substitute treatments for others due to money.  Also, a lot more time is spent on documentation than actually giving the patient good eye contact and favorable bed side manner along with taking as much time as is needed with patients.
0.760000	My doctor is very sweet and kind to me, I don't see why she would purposefully be dishonest with me about anything. Sometime's I'm confused by what she tells me, but that isn't her fault.
0.880000	My physicians assistant is very kind, listens, engaging, good sense of humor and makes me feel comfortable. He does not make me feel bad about myself if i am unsure or if i feel the need to vent or unload about a situation that is tied to feeling unwell to my situation. I would be very upset if he changes practices. 
0.600000	I do not have complete trust in my physician because sometimes they are just out for money and do not tell you everything.  They try to push medications and not everything requires prescription medicine.
0.840000	I trust my physician because she has always been honest with me and straight forward. She always tells me things even if it isn't exactly what I want to hear 
0.720000	The doctor that I have now is pretty good. He seems honest and decent. So I do trust him a good bit. Don't feel this way about all doctors but this one is pretty good.
0.760000	Since I feel good and get cured after a doctors visit i feel like the doctor is helping me to stay healthy.
0.760000	My primary care physician has known me for a couple years now and I have grown to trust in him lot. He is good at explaining things to me for the most part and is very easy going. He is also very thorough in explaining things to me and trying to see what I think about certain health issues. He has not let me down yet and has not given me a reason to distrust him.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I've been seeing them for almost 10 years and they're familiar with my health and what works best for my body.  Up to this point, they've always given me accurate information and helped me improve my health in a safe way.
0.760000	My doctor has become my friend over the years, not a close friend but a friend of a sort. I can trust him to be concerned when I'm not doing well and to think carefully about what the best course of action would be for me. I feel confident about his decision making.
1.000000	I trust my doctor wholeheartedly.  He is very concerned about my well being and has been very thorough in helping me solve my problems. He isn't afraid to deal with my insurance company head on to get me the best care.  He hasn't let me down in the past and won't do it in the future.  
0.720000	I have been working with him for over 10 years so I feel like he knows me extremely well.  He understands the health conditions I have and how the impact me.
0.880000	I feel I can trust my primary care physician because he has shown me that the decisions he helps me make about my health are the ones that are best for me. My doctor is also very clear about the decisions he makes.
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. She takes a lot of time to listen to my concerns and answer any questions I may have. She never makes me feel rushed like a lot of other doctors. She works on a gameplan to treat something with what I am most comfortable with. Most importantly, she was able to quickly diagnose a foot pain I had been experiencing for months which gave me a lot of confidence in her abilities.
0.960000	I have none my doctor for more than 10 years. He has treated me since I was a teenager. He has always putting my needs first. There has never been a time when I've questioned his decision.
0.960000	I really do trust my physician because of his bedside manner, his eye contact, his willingness to answer questions, the way he makes the encounter feel professional but personal. He always greets me when he enters the room, asks me how I've been, reviews the previous visits with me, asks if there have been any new updates or changes, if I've been sick lately. The tone he sets for the entire encounter is always very positive. He makes me feel like it's not just about a paycheck or a routine of his daily life. He asks me if I have any questions. If I do have questions, he's always willing and able to answer me honestly and completely. Sometimes he offers up information on natural remedies that usually have no drawbacks. His attitude is always bright and positive and I never have to dread going in for a checkup or appointment for a new issue. I also know he won't speak of it outside of the appointment. He has my confidence.
0.560000	I believe that my primary care physician has outdated information on certain things. It's not like they go back to school every couple of months to get updated information on certain conditions. I also believe that they kept bonuses for pushing pills on to people.
0.520000	The last time I went to the doctor they ran a lot of tests on me that resulted in a $700 bill, later when I saw my gyno he said that the tests were unnecessary. I don't have a need to go to the doctor right now but I would look for another place to go. 
0.800000	My primary care physician was extremely amiable. Even if we were not dealing with something that was quite within the realm of his expertise (such as my anxiety) he would recommend literature I could read on the subject.  He would never fail to ask follow-up questions about things I'd experienced in a previous appointment with him. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has decades of experience in conventional medicine, and also has obtained extra courses lately in naturopathy. He is very knowledgable about medical conditions and how to treat them both conventionally or alternatively with herbs, homeopathy etc. He always looks me in the eye and listens. 
0.800000	I feel like the doctor-patient relationship is built entirely on trust and so my basic foundation is totally trusting him. He's never given me any reason to doubt him.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with her for a long time. She remembers my name and is always very polite and seems generally concerned for me when I show up. Any questions that I asked are answered whole-heartedly and it feels she cares about me instead of just trying to get a bunch of my money through unneeded things.
0.800000	I trust my OBGYN, I just think he is a little c-section happy.  Two high risk pregnancies and two c-sections for someone who wanted a natural birth is a little disappointing, but everyone is healthy and alive so can't complain with the results.
1.000000	i've been going to my doctor for years and he knows me very well. he gives all options. if i want to do something like try a new medication he'll give me all the pros and cons and also give me other(better) options. he's never dimissive
0.800000	I trust them because they seem ethical.  You lknow that feeling that you get when yoj talk to someone that means that you can just trust them?  I fet that feeling from her when I talk to her.  She's really smart and into you quite a bit when you talk with her.  Id recommend her to anyone looking for a doctor in their near future for sure!
0.920000	They are always very thorough in explaining what the possibilities are for treatment. They are always so careful in explaining the pros and cons of each treatment in a way that I can weigh them more easily.
0.680000	I have trust in my physician because he has always been correct regarding any health issue I have had in the past. I have no reason to distrust him as I have never left an appointment feeling anything has been overlooked when it comes to my health
0.640000	She takes time to really listen to me. If I am doubting something, or questioning why about things she will explain it. I don't feel like I cannot bring things up to her. For example when I mentioned my anxiety she really took time to get me on meds that made me feel better. It made all the difference in the world to me. 
0.840000	She takes the time to listen to me and is very thorough in her explanations. Asks about my feelings etc.
0.960000	My doctor has always been kind to me. She answers all my questions and listens to my concerns. She gives me different options and helps me decide which is best for me.
1.000000	I see my PCP every 60 to 90 days for migraines. He will listen to my every need or issue. Often I may have something else nagging me (back pain, neck pain) and no matter what he will address these issues and guide me in the right direction. 
0.400000	"I see my PCP once a month and in any given 12 month period he may take my BP or listen to my heart 1 or 2 times in those 12 months.  He does not generally ask how I am doing or feeling only comes in, sits down in front of the computer and asks ""what do you need today"" referring to Rx refills.  He is not a hands on doctor and If I should ask or complain about a problem he dismisses it and says we are all getting older."
0.960000	I have had the same doctor for 30 years and he is like an extended family member, I feel he cares for me and will always suggest what he feels is the best treatment for me, he is very professional with an excellent bedside manner.
0.800000	My doctor always answers all of my questions and has never steered my wrong. I'm never rushed and am always number one when I'm in the room with her. 
0.640000	Sometimes it seems that they're too quick to recommend invasive treatments like drugs with bad side effects or surgery rather than trying to get the body to heal itself, which seems much safer (and less expensive) to me.
0.520000	I like my doctor, but his clinic is so busy that I sometimes get the feeling that he goes with the easiest explanation of something. It makes me willing to spend a bit more money to go to a clinic that I know isn't busy if needed.
0.800000	My primary care physician has demonstrated competency in his profession to me. That is the primary reason I have for trusting him. The medical problems I've had over the years have been solvable, and my primary care physician has always assisted me in that regard. He also trusts my judgement on my own health issues and will issue necessary prescriptions by phone if he's convinced that I need them.
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because he has a lot of experience in the medical field.  He serves as a mentor and teacher in the medical community and seems to be an expert in his field.  
0.400000	They have tried to push me away from solutions that don't involve taking drugs when those options are just as viable.
0.760000	My doctor is very open when discussing medical issues and concerns with me.  There is no issue discussing alternatives, side effects, etc.  The doctor never makes me feel uncomfortable and has always provided me with accurate information.
0.680000	"I have only seen my primary care doctor a couple of times, but she is someone my family regards highly and who has been very good to them. As a result of their good experiences, I am generally inclined to think positively of my doctor and trust her judgement. I do, however, feel I need more time to develop any feeling akin to ""complete trust."""
0.680000	I have never known him to lie about anything but sometimes I don't think another drug is the answer for everything, I like natural approaches to as many things as possible.
1.000000	I've had my doctor for a long time. She always listens when i want to talk and has given me excellent advice in the past.
0.800000	I have had my PC for 15 years now. We have a relationship that is based on trust and friendship and he is always there to discuss any problems I have. He is an excellent doctor and has a great manner with patients.
0.960000	I have been working with my primary care doctor for several years. She has a personal connection to another organization that I work with, and a similar background to my own. She has gone out of her way to build trust and extend sincere personal insight.
0.440000	My PCP just seems to have a diagnosis ready to go before we even speak. He rarely seems to be concerned with side effects I report and love to have tests run. His focus just seems very narrow, he is late and just dismissive. 
0.440000	My doctor is usually backed up and busy and I usually feel rushed and that he is just trying to get to the next patient
0.720000	I have a lot of trust in my primary car physician. They treat me like an individual and show me a lot of care. They ask me about my concerns and really try to get to know me. They are very good at diagnosing problems that I have.
0.800000	I only see my gynecologist regularly and I trust his opinion on conditions I am dealing with. He explains it to me clearly so I can understand what is going on and he makes me feel comfortable. He gets to know me as a person aside from just a patient and makes me feel like he cares about my overall well being. 
0.760000	He's very down to earth and tells me what is protocol but also what is necessary. He's a big proponent of preventative care and has always backed up his suggestions with research.
0.480000	I trust Doctors because they are in their position for a reason, but just like any other Profession they don't get to make the rules, are worried about getting sued, or don't trust their patients to tell them the truth and often go with their own assumptions, which can be both good and bad.
0.760000	I trust my doctor (cardiologist) very much. He has a great reputation and has a great amount of skill and knowledge.
0.480000	I don't completely trust any doctor. I feel like sometimes they are just guessing what a problem or solution is. I take the information the doctor gives and make my own choices on what I believe and what my next steps will be. 
0.480000	I distrust doctors a bit in general because I've had bad experiences in the past with doctors leading me down the wrong path. At the end of the day they are still just human and I believe it should be a team process in finding the best treatment for you since you are the one that has to live with the consequences. 
0.640000	If I have taken the steps to be in the presence of a healthcare professional, I have exhausted my own body of knowledge and MUST trust them to investigate further and explain the options for treatment as they may be. Their schooling and Hippocratic oath make them the only option at that point, hence one has no option but to trust someone, why not a trained and certified medical professional. 
0.600000	We tend to put doctors on a pedestal and to me this is so absurd.  They are human and subject to human error.  There is so much medical negligence.  You read about it just about every day.  My doctor does not hesitation to write out a prescription.  He is aware that I am totally against taking prescribed drugs. He only cares about a quick fix.   I also feel that it's a money game.  
0.720000	i trust my doctot because he always goes to great lengths to get to the bottom of my health issues and ive known my doctor since i was young an ive never had any issues with him all the time ive went to him
0.800000	I trust him because he seems to really know what he is doing, and was able to treat my infection correctly. He is also very kind and caring and seems to really care about the patients.
0.800000	I have been going to the same dr for years. I have never had a bad experience.  She has always steered me in the right direction.  She seems knowledgeable and is always open to listen to what I have to say .
0.400000	I feel they do not care to put in the time to really figure out and discuss health complaints and often rush patients in and out. I do not fully trust them for fixing health issues.
0.480000	Honestly I think its more about money than care of the patient. There is never a sense of urgency with doctors. 
0.800000	I feel doctors, in general, have the patient's care and well-being in mind when they are treating them. I feel that a patient has to have that trust in their doctor or they should probably get a new one.  A patient needs to feel that trust because their doctor is such an important part of staying well, or getting well.
0.440000	They have given me wrong diagnosis before- leading to wrong medication and side effects and addition to the HUGE bills!!!
0.480000	I have Type 2 diabetes and I know that my condition is not as serious as everybody else since every time I'm eating a healthy diet, my numbers stay stable and I would feel great. My doctor keeps trying to push insulin to me even though, I know I don't need it. She even mentioned that they are normally told by their providers to try to offer insulin more towards patients. They try to restrict my refills for a diabetic medicine that I normally need just so that they could make me come in and so that they can charge my insurance company. They won't give me refills until I check-in with them, which for something standard like Diabetes, I don't think I need.
0.600000	I trust my physician for the most part. There are times though that I have questioned her. It is because medical degree or not we all have preferences and she is going to only offer me her preferences and I may not know about other options 
0.800000	For the most part I trust my doctor. They have always been honest with me and see to take the time to explain the problems that I have. There have been times where I asked a million questions and they are more than happy to answer. My daughters doctor is a little different. They always seem to be in a rush. 
0.880000	"My primary care physician is a very thoughtful doctor.  He listens closely to what I have to say, and thinks about his responses.  He has a lot of experience, and he seems to have a ""conservative"" approach, in that he doesn't immediately jump to an aggressive treatment."
0.880000	I have been going to the same doctor for 14 years and have only had good experiences.  She listens and does not always push medications.
0.560000	i do trust my primary care doctor as he has been my personal physician for over year now. He always thinks good about us and give us good medication . 
0.760000	My doctor will sit down and listen to me and my concerns and she will also talk to me in terms that I understand  she will not leave until I fully understand her and what she is saying
0.400000	Based on anecdotes and past experiences, doctors cannot be trusted many times. Sadly, there are a lot of doctors who will play with your lives for the money. That is not to say all doctors are like that, but you have to be careful.
1.000000	I mean, it is their job to make sure that I receive the best care possible. I am sure they don't want to be facing some sort of repercussions based on how they care for me. I would like to think that they became doctors to help people like me to get the best care they can administer, and so it would be somewhat out of character if they were to skimp on my care.
0.560000	I trust my doctor but if I had a serious illness I would see a specialist and if I was given a new medication I would investigate it before taking it.
0.640000	I don't have a primary care physician, but overall I think doctors will do what they can to help you. Unfortunately I think sometimes circumstances force them to treat patients in more of a hurry which may make them seem like they don't care. But overall I think most doctors genuinely want to help people and have no interest other than to help you get well.
1.000000	Doctors take an oath of not doing harm and with the risk of malpractice they would not do what is convenient but what is right.
0.480000	I feel that the majority of doctors have taken a general approach to caring for patients. I think they are forced to see so many patients an hour that if you complain about a typical set of things then they prescribe or recommend x based solely off that.
0.600000	Doctord I see are more interested to get clients moving through their offices. The focus on the number of clients rather than quality service.
0.640000	Alot of my anxiety of fully trusting doctors boils down to when my grandfather was sick.  The doctors were not able to identify the source of his fever until I mentioned that after googling his symptoms that lymphoma has all the same symptoms.  Only then, they finally tested and were able to diagnose him 24 hours before he passed away.
0.800000	I really trust and respect my doctor.  He takes a lot of time with me at each appointment and always asks me a bunch of questions.  He is kind and seems like he really cares about me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor to the extent that he does not want me to die.  But I am not 100% confident that he has presented me with all the available remedies for my situation as there are new drugs and theories being discovered yearly.
0.880000	My doctor seems professional; I have no reason to distrust their advice given to me with regards to my health. Every step they've taken when I've been unwell has made a lot of sense and ultimately helped me.
0.600000	Sometimes when I visit my doctor, I feel extremely rush and unimportant. Other days, I feel like my doctor actually listens to my problems and needs 
0.600000	It is not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician. Instead, it is simply wanting to question things in order to protect myself regardless. This method works for my best interest.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has yet to steer me wrong. Whenever I am having a problem or I need a question answered he is there to listen and give me a thorough diagnosis. He also looks out for me by recommending me the best products with the lowest price. If my problem can be fixed easily with a drugstore product then my doctor has no problem bringing up that product first. Even if I feel as though my problem was major and my doctor diagnoses it as something simple like a stomach ache, he will still treat the situation as important and reassures me in showing that it wasn't a waste of time to come.
0.480000	There have been many times over the past several years that I've gone to doctors with medical complaints, probably all coming from the same source, and left their care with no real effective plan of treatment, and limited insight about what precisely is going wrong with my health, and this applies to primary care physicians, and specialists, and ER doctors. It seems pretty clear that either they can't treat whatever is wrong with me, or just don't care.
0.520000	I have family in the health care business and would trust them whole heartedly. I think that it is important to have trust in your doctors. They go through a lot of training and pledge an oath to provide to their patients as well as they can.
0.800000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she consistently treats me with respect and listens to my needs. She's also willing to say when she's unsure about something and when I need to seek additional resources or opinions, rather than pretending to know everything about everything. 
0.680000	My PCP means well (and I do not at all mean that as a sarcastic comment) but like most PCPs in the days of managed care plans, he is overworked and cannot take the time to really get to know each patient thus some critical things can fall through the cracks unless I make a point of bringing them up to him.  Otherwise, he just orders blood work every three months and bases his whole appointment with me on the bloodwork results instead of, for example, looking at the fact that as a 60 year old woman with severe osteoporosis (due to my osteogenesis imperfecta) I am supposed to be having annual bone density scans.   I have to bring up things like bone density scans, mammograms, etc. to him myself because if it is not a blood test result, it will fall through the cracks.   In his defense, I will say, he orders thorough blood tests, goes over the results with me to make sure I understand them and when I do bring up something outside of the blood tests, he listens and works with me on it.  He is a good doctor, just overworked.  I don't trust him to be aware of my health conditions.  I do trust him to work with me when I remind him of what is going on with me.
0.840000	I have never had any reason not to trust her. All care I have received has been prompt and efficient and addressed any concerns/issues I had.
0.920000	My primary care physician has the qualifications and the experience to make the right decisions. She also takes into consideration my opinion and strives to give me the highest quality of life she can.
0.840000	My PA is extremely intelligent.  He listens to me, and he gives me credit for knowing something is wrong with my body.  He involves me in treatment planning.
0.760000	I think i can trust my primary care physician i feel that most doctors are honest people.some doctor my not be trustworthy but i have had no reason not to trust my doctor. if i thought my doctor could not be trusted i would look for another primary care physician.
0.840000	Firstly, I tends to trust people. For doctors who are well-educated and respected, I trust most of them. As I experienced, most doctors are very nice and professional.
0.720000	I have no reason to not trust him. I don't believe that he would knowingly do anything to harm me and he has no reason to lie to me. Also I've grown to trust him after seeing him for some time. 
0.600000	I am not sure he takes the time to understand everything is happening to me. Sometimes I think his time is much more valuable than my health.
0.800000	I actually have a new PPC so I don't have a lot of experience with her.  From what I do know, I trust her and her judgement.
0.600000	Most doctors are greedy. The money is more important than our health. They perform unnecessary treatments to earn more money
1.000000	If a doctor has great bedside manner it makes it easy to trust them. Most of the doctors I have ever been to have had a great bedside manner which makes it feel like they are there for me and not just to do what is convenient for him/her. A doctor that is rude makes it hard to believe
0.800000	My doctor always gives me several options for and would be treatment I may need be it medicine, further testing and even sending me for second opinions.
1.000000	He is very, very thorough. He is older than me, so he uses alot of old fashioned methods. But that is good, because he takes his time and listens.
0.480000	I have been with my GP for almost 20 years.  Over those years, he and I have built a sort of rapport that I have come to trust.  Unfortunately, in the last year or so, something has changed.  He is less tolerant with questions and does not give  you much time to discuss your concerns.  He is more concerned with getting you out of his office and moving on to the next patient.  I am currently looking for a different  GP. 
0.360000	Because if they are so rushed to see you and need to make appointments that they can't even keep most of the time, then something is wrong with their time management. I feel like I've told the doctor things before and they just brush it off like it's no big deal or that it's normal when I know that it's not. They just don't want to have to sit there any longer. 
0.760000	I've been going to my primary physician for years and she has earned my trust. Also my mom who works in the medical field says nothing but praises for my primary physician.My primary physican gives me good advice and tries to maintain my health in the right area.
0.840000	I was going to the same primary care physician since i was very young. My mother personally knows my doctor so i feel very comfortable taking advice from that person. I think this person has good intentions and really wants to help me 
0.680000	In my case I have always looked for doctors who earn my trust. Currently my doctor is trusted because he has a lot of academic experience and also has a very good experience practicing what he already knows. During the consultations shows that he knows what he is doing, and that gives me confidence, something that is very important to deposit in a doctor
0.800000	I had trouble for a long time finding a good doctor. I had stomach issues and other weird problems for a decade. Then I switched to my current doctor, she tested my thyroid and Iâve felt so much better since. Sheâs been pretty spot on since Iâve started seeing her. My whole family see her we trust her so much. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he is a smart, competent person who is not in a rush and cares about providing my good advice and counsel.  But I also realize that there are limits to his experience and knowledge and he rarely runs tests to understand the problems.  So yes, I trust that he isn't lying but I don't always believe that he is correct.
0.800000	I mostly trust my doctor. He seems like a nice and caring guy and very thorough. I haven't been seeing him long, but I think he does a good job and is very attentive. 
0.960000	My primary doctor is easy to communicate with, she provides easy to understand responses and is thorough.  She is part of a larger medical system that provides excellent care.  She works well with other doctors/staff from the larger system.  I can count on her.
0.400000	I lost a lot of trust in the medical field in general and especially with doctors while uncovering some information over the years. When I have learned that companies pay doctors to push their pharmaceuticals and also offer them incentive for prescribing their products and meeting up with them. Uncovering things like this just added to the distrust in the medical profession. 
0.960000	I went to several Doctors to find the one that I have now.  My doctor will stay in the room with you until they have answered all questions.  My doctor does not let anything else distract him while you are being examined.  The doctor will ask several times if you understand or if you need them to go over anything else again.
1.000000	I have a strong trust in my provider. She has spent extra time with me when I needed it and followed up after stressful visits to make sure I fon't have more questions and to just check in with me.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they are a professional and it is their job. In my experiences, they seem to know what they are doing, provide good advice, and respond to any questions and concerns I have. The person looks and acts professionally and I have no reason to distrust them or doubt their competence. They are more knowledgeable than me so I trust their advice and directions on health matters.
0.960000	She is thorough and she actually listens to me. She wants what is best for me, but doesnt put me through unnecessary testing.  She is kind and follows up. She is quick to answer questions when I ask
0.720000	They are experienced and i feel that they know more about what is going on than i do.  I don't feel they are swayed by drug vendors often but that thought has crossed my mind before.  Overall i feel trusting of doctors.
0.600000	I beelive that he knows what is best for me. He has taken care of his education, and has been training in his life in order to make sure he knows what he's doing. That is something that lets me think he is a professional,
0.880000	doctor seems competent, will answer any questions i have and usually explain things before i need them to be explained. very detailed and always up to date on task
0.720000	I do not either trust or distrust my doctor. I feel they are they to evaluate my physical condition and to make recommendations to maintain or improve my health. They are a valuable resource which I can then use to make a decision of how to proceed given the options which have been discussed.
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general. I believe that it all about the money so to speak. Medicine has caused more issues than the ailments it is said to assist with. If one medicine helps with one ailment for example, then it more than likely has at least ten side effects. Not to mention the costs of medicine. If someone is healthy, they make no money. 
0.760000	I have had a lot of changes with my primary care physician so I cannot always trust that the doctor I saw the last time will be the same doctor I see the next time, but the doctor that I have currently been seeing I have much trust in. 
0.960000	My NP seems to have a good grasp on medications I am to be prescribed, giving me confidence in taking it. If it works out not so well, she is on board with another medication that might help instead.
0.800000	I have complete trust in my doctor. Since seeing my current doctor, he has on one occasion spent almost an hour with me explaining why my cholesterol is the way it is. The fact that he invested that much time with me instead of leaving in 10-15 minutes told me that he cares about what I need to know and is willing to take the time to make sure I understand why things happen like they do.
0.760000	I know they are in the positions that they hold because of extensive education, experience and trust building with patients. They are able to answer all of my questions in a credible and convincing manner. I have had no breaches of trust to make me react otherwise.
0.440000	I do not trust my primary care physician because he acts very rushed. He only wants to deal with one issue per appointment. I am also worried that doctors are encouraged to prescribe pharmaceuticals over other treatment options.
0.800000	All in all over the years going to the doctor has been a pleasant experience. The doctors I have visited have been kind and helpful. One reason I think I have such a positive opinion of doctors is because I rarely use them. 
0.840000	I do trust doctors for the most part, they have the education and experiences above my own. I think that the trust I put in my doctors, as well as the research I can do on my own, makes a good team in my healthcare.
0.720000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has extensive experience in her field. She is backed by a degree specializing in her area and she's had no complaints from me or any other patients. She makes me feel comfortable.
0.280000	I've been seeing my current PCP for 9 years but he often forgets (even with my records in front of him) the nature of my chronic conditions. He is disorganized, abrupt, and has a tendency to dismiss my concerns
0.680000	I do understand that some doctors try to generalize symptoms for pharmaceutical practices here in America. This sometimes causes doctors to prescribe certain drugs or procedures that may be common to their field. However, I think healthcare has allowed more transfers from physicians to the specialist. Helping things become more focused and thorough.
0.760000	I havent felt that my doctor has ever misled me in the past, nor given me bad advice. Whatever I went into the doctors for, eventually was healed or cured. 
0.600000	"I don't have a current one, but my last one accused me of drinking a ""starbucks milkshake"" before my blood test when I repeatedly answered that I had not consumed anything that morning for the blood test. He also fought with me about my premie status as a baby and whether or not the scar sites were for a heart surgery I had to fix a murmur. I've seen my own bill for my birth, I had the surgery. He then tried to forcefully sign me up for Jenny Craig before I left, which would not be covered by my insurance, and insisted on offering me the flu shot after I declined several times because I already had the shot. "
0.800000	My primary care doctor is somebody who I have known for quite some time. I trust that he has my best interests at heart and will always make sure that his decisions reflect where I want to be with the treatment. 
0.440000	When my doctor is not rushed and has time he always answers my questions and does not rush me.  When he is very busy I feel as though he ignores me and does not take what I say into consideration.  I trust him when he explains his decisions to me but I do not trust rushed and unexplained decisions.  
0.760000	I feel like not trusting a doctor is foolish. It takes an incredible amount of dedication, smarts, and experience to become a doctor. I trust experts in most places where it makes sense, unless something seems off about them. I might be less inclined to trust a doctor where I was not as sure of his credentials, like maybe in a third world country. I do not have a primary care physician to think to but I would like to think If i Did, I would place a great deal of trust in them to give me accurate advice. If I did no trust the doctor, I would pretty quickly find a new one.
0.960000	"I don't have a primary care physician, I pretty much just go to whoever I'm sent to.  To put it simply, I haven't run into any doctors who did NOT give me any reason to trust them.  All of them have been professional.  True, one of them didn't have a good ""bedside manner"", but that was it.  He still got the job done.  "
0.760000	I have never had a bad experience with a doctor. I always ask questions and have an open dialog. It works for me.
0.520000	My PCP is not somebody that I see very often. I have not gone to my PCP regularly for about 5 years now. I only go if there is something seriously wrong, which has only been like 2 times in the past 5 years.
0.960000	My doctor has taken an oath to provide the best care and help ensure I am healthy. I trust their advice and guidance in terms of my wellness. I have no reason to believe that my doctor is anything but straight forward with me.
0.480000	I had a doctor for years who was incredibly thorough and I did completely trust always. Unfortunately that doctor is no longer in practice. I have had experiences with other doctors that have led me to question whether they truly are thorough at all, and I don't have the level of trust with any of my current providers that I had with my former PCP. 
1.000000	My primary care physician has been my primary care physician since I was a teenager and she is the provider I take my kids to. When she has been wrong she has admitted it. She fits us in at the last minute when needed, is willing to try more than one thing when I ask and always listens and take into account what I have to say. I worry about finding a new provider when she retires.
0.800000	She shows me that she cares. She refers me to specialists when she's unsure, she follows up with me quickly, and she seems very knowledgeable.
0.440000	I somewhat distrust doctors in general to take the time to explain all treatment options because they are in such a hurry and want to get to the next patient to make more money. I don't think they want to waste time to followup when patients need additional explanation, help, or guidance with their situation.
0.720000	I believe doctors had some participatory stake in the prescription opiate mess.  While most doctors didn't have inside information on the pharmaceutical industry's practices  with respect to testing and marketing, I believe there have been relatively few doctors who have actually expressed a lot of remorse about the whole affair. That being said, doctors can't be held entirely accountable for living in a culture that is, in some sense, addictive in its makeup. My attitude toward doctors is governed by the principle that I do not expect mistake-free behavior on the part of anyone. All I ask is that doctors or other medical professionals who work with me give their best effort and use the best information available to them.
0.760000	I don't feel I have a reason to doubt the sincerity of my primary care physician, as I feel that when I've gone to see him, he performs a thorough exam and blood work, etc., and has not recommended any courses of treatment that seemed suspect to me. Fortunately I have been very healthy and so have not really had many visits with him other than my yearly checkups, so I suppose I don't know if I can fully trust his decisions on treatment options, but I really don't have a reason to doubt him.
0.520000	I don't go to the Dr all the often, but when I did, it always seemed like he was in a rush. I would tell him what was ailing me, but it felt like he was just talking at me instead of to me. It felt like he never took me seriously. He has since moved on to another practice out of state, but I don't miss my former doctor at all.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician completely. He is wise, sensible, practical. He always has time for questions or discussion on issues important to me. He has never steered me wrong.
0.920000	She is a family friend. She takes the time to check on me as a person and not just what is written on the chart for the reason I am visiting her.  She touches up on multiple aspects of my life as far as family, physical activity, emotional state, and other things that may have an influence on my health.
0.880000	I have seen my primary physician for a number of years. He has always been thorough in hearing out my problems and then giving multiple options as how to treat the problems. All the times ive had to go see him the diagnosis and treatments he has recommended have been spot on
0.840000	I very much trust my primary care physician. She is quite young but doesn't hesitate to scold or call me out when she's not happy with me. I don't like doctors or the whole medical process and she knows what buttons to push. She answers my questions patiently and explains her thought processes behind all her decisions. She very much talks to me and never through me and that's a huge plus. 
0.480000	Really they are just humans like everyone else. They chose a career path, went to university for many years and got a job in the industry. How much they actually consolidated from their education is questionable. Often times it seems they're doing a lot of common sense work or things that a layman could figure out himself if he had access to the equipment and the internet. You also have to question if they have ulterior motives or reason to push medication that may not be the most advantageous. Their education is very very narrow as well, they don't often know much about natural medicine or even things like paleo diets or aspects/principles of primal living. I have to question what kind of person these doctors are and whether they even value their lives themselves because stepping back it looks like they slaved away at school just to become a doctor and deal with sick people all the time. A life like that would be miserable to me, so I wonder if some doctors even care about anything they are doing or if they are following a path for money or to impress others. 
0.600000	Sometimes I feel that my primary care physician is stretched too thin and sees too many patients. I realize he cannot remember everything, but he does have my electronic medical record readily available to him. I feel that often I have to repeat issues I have, and I don't think he is just testing my understanding. I think he has forgotten and not bothered to remind himself by reviewing my record. I also have to call the office because I will sometimes get test results before they call me about them. I don't think that my physician would intentionally harm me or lie to me, I just think that he is seeing too many patients - putting quantity over quality to make a profit.
0.440000	"i haven't been to my primary in years because when i had a medical problem and i came to them they said they wouldn't do test because it wasn't their ""area"". they are general practitioners. everything is their area they could have taken blood and run labs and then refereed me but they didn't do anything  "
0.960000	This specialist has been my doctor for fours.  I have multiple medical issues, all complex.  The doctor has a very high knowledge of the diagnosis and treatments, and gives me all the options.  I trust this doctor very much
0.240000	I have been misdiagnosed so many times by doctors that I do not trust them to be able to help me in any capacity. They seem to have their own motives in mind and do not care about the actual problem I'm experiencing or finding a solution. I feel like the reason they are in their profession is solely to make as much money as they can.
0.680000	It is not that I do not trust my doctor, however, I am aware that my doctor is only trained in western medicine. I am open to remedies and treatments that western medicine may not be knowledgeable about or have believe works. I know that my doctor is limited due to their training. 
0.760000	For the most part I trust him but there are times when he seems to give me contradictory information from visit to visit and that makes me nervous. For example, one time my cholesterol will be borderline high and he'll mention it as something I need to work on then next time it will be extremely high and he won't say anything.
0.560000	Very few doctor visits are completely satisfactory, maybe because my expectations are too high. I think that if you see the medical profession as just another job, you tend to just try to go through and get over with any patient care at hand as quickly as you can. 
0.760000	my doctor is only telling me whats best for me. He has my best interest in mind when I have an appointment with him. He is only trying to get me to stay healthy or get me back to that point.
0.880000	The only real reason that I would not trust my PCP is that she is not an expert in a specific medical field. However, I trust her recommendations for specialists implicitly.
0.440000	"In the current times it seems doctors easily push the strongest drugs on a patient. By saying this I don't mean to suggest any link to the opioid crisis in the country. For instance, my last emergency care visit was last year when I had a kidney stone. This wasn't the first time I've ever had one (2nd time in the emergency room for it in 10 years), and they gave me extremely harsh prescriptions. One of the medications prescribed was Ciprofloxacin instead of pencillin to fight bacteria (I apparently had a UTI). After only taking ""Cipro"" a total of 3 times, it gave me deep pain in my joints that lasted for over 6 months. I could hardly walk and I definitely couldn't bend my knees. I think doctors  jump the gun with a lot of medications instead of starting ""small"" to see what works. I tend to believe doctors now are really careless with all the serious side effects because they spend so little time with patients."
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for over 15 years. He is very honest and down to earth. I have always taken the advice of my primary care doctor with excellent results. 
0.600000	My primary care physician is okay for routine care, but I have never been so sick that I needed extra attention. If something big were to go wrong with my physician, I'm not sure I would trust her completely without a second opinion. She has been fine so far, but I'm generally healthy.
0.760000	Usually, when I have several questions about something that is going ion when my health, my doctor usually has all the answers to whatever my questions are to put my mind at ease. Sometimes, I have my doubts about the answers and then just google search more about when we talked about or on my visit I will ask more questions and he will answer them once again to put my mind at ease.
0.760000	Doctors in general seem to want to prescribe the most efficient treatment possible in my opinion. I've only ever had one experience where I felt like the doctor was rushing me along or not really listening to any concerns I had.
1.000000	Out of the plethora of doctors I have seen in my life, only two stand out; one I used to see in another state before we moved and my current doctor.  My current doctor tells it like it is and doesn't sugar-coat anything.  Actually, he is quite assertive with me and I respond well to that.
1.000000	I trust him very much because when I needed help with something he referred me in the right direction. That next experience was a healthy and good experience for me that has made me healthier.
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor completely. I had a great doctor but he transferred and I got stuck with this guy. I want to change doctors but I am still trying to give this guy a chance because maybe he will get better with time. I know that he tries on his diagnosis but have found that I have had to go to a urgent care more than once because he doesn't get it right.
0.960000	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  He's one of the few good ones left that takes the time to get to know you and talk to you.  I feel like he's a close friend when I'm there.
0.480000	I haven't been to the doctors in awhile, however, as alluded to in my previous answer, I don't believe dermatology doctor is through. I have had the same issues I presented to him over a year ago and he simple just keeps suggesting new types of medication instead of fixing the root cause.
0.760000	I've been with my primary doctor for years and he's already proven himself to me. He was able to dispose sinus problems I have work recommending Claritin D and Flonase daily. Others kept referring me to ENTs who have me no real answers to my constant sinus infections.
0.680000	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE THEY GIVE THEM THEIR BEST TO  HELP  IN OUR WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY AND GOOD . THEY ALWAYS SUGGEST GOOD THINGS .
1.000000	I have been seeing the same primary care physician for 30 years and have established a long-standing and mutually respectful relationship.  While I trust her judgment completely, she also value my input and abides by my wishes if I prefer one plan of action over another.  when I need a referral to a specialist, she acts quickly.
0.920000	Whenever I went to see the doctor he was always completely honest with me. He would tell me what was wrong or if he wasn't completely sure he would work to figure it out and recommend me to another doctor if he couldn't. When i would go in for check ups he would also give me advise on better ways to improve my health. 
0.600000	I have been seeing my PCP for 10 years and he has always been very good in all ways until two years ago I was sick and nobody could figure out what was wrong. My Dr told me I was just beginning the change of life called perimenopause and had nothing to worry about. I knew that was not right I was much to sick for it to be normal. I went through 5 additional Drs trying to get answers and even specialists. I finally found one Dr who actually sat down and talked to me for an hour which never happens but he could see how sick I was and I had lost so much weight I weighed 81lbs....so he did a whole battery of blood tests and finally after 2 years of being mostly bedridden I had an answer. It was or could have been found in the beginning if my Dr would have listened to me and just did some bloodwork. After that I will go to my regular pcp but I don't trust him after that, he could have killed me. I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia which is a vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Thank God for that one Dr and my gut instincts.
0.960000	The general care practitioner I go to is really good. They do the basics really well and I don't ever really require anything besides some antibiotics every 7-10 years anyway.
0.640000	I think that they will try to keep me sick so that they can make money off of me for as long as they can.
0.720000	I trust my PCP because she tells it like it is. I have met doctors before who cautiously agree with whatever the patient says, because maybe they don't want to alienate or be subject to poor reviews. But my internist is very candid.
0.760000	Most doctors enter into their profession to help people.  Extensive training is required to become a doctor, so they should know what they are doing.
0.560000	My physician is currently near the end of her fifth pregnancy and sheâs pretty tired.  I expect things will get better but Iâve been relying more on her nurse practitioner.
0.440000	My current primary care doctor is only concerned with my weight. In her mind any issue that arises could be solved if I would lose some weight. She always makes sure the address my weight at each visit and ensure that I am aware of the negative ways that being overweight could affect me. She assumes that I will become addicted to certain medications just because I am overweight.
0.760000	I typically trust my primary care physician unless they are inattentive or give me a reason not to trust them. If they lose my trust then I just find a new doctor and I do not give them the chance to betray me a second time. 
0.800000	My family and I have been with the practice for a long time. The experience is always comfortable and open and honest.
0.640000	I mostly trust my primary care doctor. I trust them in addressing my concerns and treating my problem appropriately. Sometimes, I feel like doctors differ over what treatment option is best so I get a second opinion.
0.960000	I have used my doctor for almost 30 years as I had my son when I was 18. He was just started out in his practice. I have used him since then for my other two deliveries and as my primary physician for my yearly checkups. He goes above and beyond with his bedside manner and thoroughness. He took care of me throughout major complications with all of my pregnancies and I have three healthy children.
0.760000	I feel that my doctor has often gone out of her way to help since I am in a very dire financial situation. As well she has given me advice and recommendations for alternative treatments for certain problems I have had i.e.she does not believe that drugs are a cure-all but helps me get to the root of certain health conditions.
0.800000	My doctor has given me pretty good advice at my annual physicals without being overly pushy or forward about it. He's personable and laid back and seems to have my best interests at heart.
0.840000	My doctor changes about every year or two, but my most recent doctor has been very honest with me from day 1.
0.360000	I currently do not have a primary care physician, but the one that I previously had did not seem to care that much about me or understand how I was feeling. I distrusted her, because she didn't take much time to listen to what I had to say about my thyroid, symptoms, and she didn't act like she wanted to help me. I felt like my previous primary care physician treated me more like a number, rather than a patient.
0.680000	I am currently between primary care physicians because my insurance coverage and physical location has changed several times recently. But when I did have a regular primary care physician(s) which I did for many years, I felt that in general I could trust them. However, in all cases I do my own research and use logic whenever possible. I try to avoid any and all medications, which I feel is too often the focus of physicians, to push drugs. For that reason, I canât say that I ever have complete trust in a doctor.  I take pretty much anything a physician might say or do with a âgrain of saltâ, always considering the possibility that the drug factor could be playing a significant role.
0.600000	I really think that this person may have an asian fetish and think of me as a geisha.  It really makes me feel uncomfortable.
0.800000	I have never had a reason to distrust them. I have had a somewhat wrong diagnosis in the past, but this wasn't a major issue and they directed me to someone who could provide me with a more accurate diagnosis and method of treatment. 
0.560000	She is a fine doctor, but very busy and does not seem to spend the time necessary to think through all of the options or which option is most likely - she picks something that might be an answer and we move forward.  It's OK, I trust that she is being honest, but I don't trust that she has the right answer.
0.400000	In general I have a distrust for my primary care physician and doctors in general. I feel this way because whenever I have had a medical issue it is rare that I get any kind of resolution or any real help. I feel that doctors are so quick to medicate and not find out what the underlying issue is creating the problem. Because any doctors are of any real help I try to avoid going to them even when I need it. It seems like no matter how many blood tests or other kinds of medical tests one gets there is never any resolution to the problem only a cover up of the problem. I feel like doctors just cover the surface and never really dig deep to understand the problem. I do believe there are rare doctors that will dig deep and get the medical problem and try to solve it, but these doctors are extremely rare. In addition I feel like doctors do not take time with their patients anymore. There is no caring. It feels like they try to see as many patients as possible and never really take the time to get to know someone and their needs. In all I can't trust doctors anymore. At one time I trusted them more but I have seen the medical profession really decline in quality of care. 
0.720000	When i trust my doctor, it helps to create a better relationship between the two of us. Those who distrust the doctor may end up being combative, and that is not conducive to good health. Of course, trusting your doctor starts when you have a good doctor that is professional
0.880000	He makes the time to talk with me and ask me if I have any questions. He never seems to be in a rush or rush me. He has made good decisions for me in the past.
0.640000	As a human being I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, unless they prove otherwise. As far as regarding my relationship with my primary physician, I would say it is mostly trustworthy. But I do not put pass anybody moving in a way of their own benefit. I am in my sound mind when it comes down to my health, you can not pay enough for it, and it is very precious. So with that being said I trust me only. My health is very important for me. I try to be well versed in it myself, so I can know what is going on with me. My body is my temple.
0.640000	I trust what is said, but sometimes I feel like I am not a person to my doctor, and he could misread my symptoms.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician, in part because my father, who was also a physician had recommended him. All my interactions with him are positive and he has genuine concern and interest in my health.
0.920000	My primary care physician has already proven her abilities to me. Three years ago I almost died from an acute COPD flareup that just would not get better. My Dr. took care of me, made sure I understood what was going on and how much danger I was in, hospitalized me and treated me. she then changed my whole maintenance med routine to improve my overall health. At this time she was the ER Dr on duty not my primary care Dr. After that hospitalization I changed her to my primary care Dr. I knew I would never find a Dr more dedicated to my health and I trust her 100%
0.840000	I have a complete trust  my primary care physician.They dont lie about my health reports and provide me actual information about my health.They even help me understood if anything is hard know about my health conditions.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I've been going to her for quite some time and she's been pretty good at keeping me healthy. She knows my health and my needs so well, I almost feel like my chart is the only one in her file. I've asked other people in the office for their opinion on our doctor and all the responses seem to be very favorable. The office staff seems to be very knowledgeable and attentive. It really doesnât bother me to go to my primary care physician at all because I know Iâm going to feel better. 
0.520000	I mostly trust her, but I feel that she is very rushed and asks few questions. I feel like she does not ask enough questions. This is compared to previous doctors I've had in the past.
0.960000	My doctor always takes an extended amount of time to discuss all of my issues with me and make sure that I understand them. He is willing to do whatever I would like to make me feel comfortable and taken care of. He is bluntly honest and makes sure I know all of the side effects of my medications and whether or not I should be concerned about them. He has been right in every diagnosis he has given me so far. 
0.560000	I think generally I do trust my doctor, however, I think that ultimately after listening to my doctor any decisions about my health are basically mine and I don't always agree with my doctor. I had doctors who would tell me I needed procedures, that I don't think would have been right for me, so I I would seek another doctor. I also feel like some doctors are only interested in money and aren't interested in your well being.I have had doctors bill me for things I didn't get or charge me for cancelling an appointment.
0.600000	In most doctor I don't have a whole lot of trust. This is based on my experiences in life. I have had some good experiences as well. Not all doctors are bad.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. If there's ever a time that I don't, I don't have a problem getting a second opinion from another doctor. That doesn't mean that I don't trust him as a whole, just that in a certain situation, I would like to know that he is consistent with another doctor. I feel that I can trust my doctor because he seems invested in me. He know about me personally, and he shows true interest in my life.
0.840000	I have worked hard to find a physician who will listen to and believe me when I talk about my health.  My doctor not only listens but acts on what I am telling her.  I trust her because we work as a team when it comes to my health concerns.
0.800000	I have been using my doctor since I was a child.it was our family doctor and I have kind of grown with him as I have aged.he has always been right
0.760000	I have been seeing my PCP for almost 8 years, so we have developed a pretty good relationship, and I do trust her. I trust her so much that my children also see her. There are some areas that I feel she isn't expert on, but that is why she refers us to specialists.
0.760000	My primary care physician is really good. She is hired by my company and not her own doctor's office, so she really cares about taking the time to listen and explain things to me. 
0.640000	I am not currently on pain medication, but if I were I would be extremely wary of having only one doctor's opinion due to the prescription opiate addiction epidemic that is sweeping the United States. 
0.800000	They treat me as a friend. Being a medical professional they done use word to dum down what is being discussed. I much rather they tell me using the medical term vs trying to avoid miscommuication
0.920000	I've been going to the same doctor since I was an infant.  He's well known in town and well liked.  He spends as much time as you need NEVER giving you the feeling that he's rushed.  Never.  He sits and listens quietly and intently to what you have to say.  Which also makes the patients outside waiting impatient and complain until they get in the room and he shows them the same patient listening to their symptoms, issues.  That's why I wait patiently when I'm waiting because I know what he's doing.  
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been treating me ever since I was little. My mother was taking me to a different doctor when I was younger and he was repeatedly misdiagnosing my illness. My mother got frustrated and switched doctors, the one of which is still my current primary care physician.
1.000000	I have had my doctor for a long time. He seems my entire family and children. He is kind and patient. Makes sure you understand everything and does not rush with you.
0.520000	I feel I can trust my primary care doctor within reason.  I do feel some of the newer drugs he tries to put me on are because he gets some sort of kick back.  I question if these drugs are really in my best interest or in his.  I also feel that sometimes he doesn't listen to what I am saying and just goes by the book.  
0.880000	I fully trust my doctor because I know her personally outside of the doctor's office. She also delivered our child and I have seen her in action. I trust her.
1.000000	My primary care physician belongs to a practice which both myself, my wife and several of our friends have been patients in for many years. They have great reputations in the community. Additionally, my physician has excellent bedside manners, is very easy to talk to and always asks if there is anything that they can do better during the course of my visits. My primary care physician makes me feel comfortable and secure in knowing that they are giving the best attention possible.
0.960000	I typically trust my doctor and am not afraid to raise concerns if I do not agree with something she says or does.  She typically puts my concerns first and knows that I like to weigh all of my options when it comes to making any decisions.  I am not afraid to find another doctor if I do not agree with the way any of my medical problems are being handled and any doctor I see I make sure and let them know.
0.480000	I fully believe she is doing her best, The current health care system piles workloads on top of the short supply of doctors. Due to the high workload and the short amount of time available for each patient they are not nearly as thorough as one would like. Also due to time constraints and information sharing problems they are almost never up to date on your files and past Labs, ext. They put out health fires but do little to promote general good health and long term goals. I also feel there is a long gap between current medical research and what is being practiced at the physician level, i believe in the worst cases there are old doctors practicing the medicine they learned in college, when 30 years of new science is being ignored. 
0.680000	I trust doctors because they are extremely knowledgeable but they can make mistakes because they work in a fast pace high stress environment
0.920000	I'VE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR OVER 15 YEARS AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND FORTHCOMING WITH ME. THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE TIME I CAN THINK OF WHERE I QUESTIONED WHAT I WAS TOLD REGARDING MY HEALTH
0.680000	Doctors are human.  Yes, they are highly trained and can have lots of experience, but mistakes still happen.  Sometimes it's a simple fault, and sometimes it's due to complacency.  In any case, I bear the responsibility for my health, not them.  They can make suggestions and offer advice, but it is ultimately up to me what happens to maintain my health.
1.000000	The doctors I have had throughout my life have always been good to me.  I have never had any problems with them.  I am very confident in them no matter what the situation is.
0.880000	I trust my dr because he is always up front and honest with me and tells me all. He always listens to my concerns and is always listening and helping me out. He is a caring dr. Not one that just gets you in and out to make money.
0.520000	It is really hard for me to trust anybody. Also, a lot of doctors are only out for themselves. However, I have had about 8 surgeries and all of my surgeons were awesome and I trust the surgeons! 
0.760000	 I generally have trust in my doctor's motives. I have bad reactions to some prescribed medications but, the doctor was not careless or incorrect in prescribing them for me.  The two bad experiences I had were; a doctor who wanted to do a surgical procedure in office with local anesthesia that, as I found out when I had it done in hospital, would have likely killed me if I had allowed him to proceed, and a doctor who took a phone call while suturing me and allowed a poorly trained nurse to finish the job. Big scar! I have had many more doctors who went the extra mile and saved my life or health through being extra thorough with my diagnosis.
0.680000	I went through few primary doctors. Some are trustable more than other. Over all i trust them because i don't know any better than them. Of course, i make sure i understand what they are saying and what they mean. What are the advantage and disadvantage of particular medicine or treatment before i make my decision? If i  have a certain condition and if i don't trust them then that not good for my health. If i am doubtful then i will take the second opinion. But i will not ignore completely what my doctor is saying.
0.880000	My doctor has my best interests at heart and u believe this to be true because he shows genuine interest in my well being and my day to day life decisions that may affect my health and self worth
0.960000	My doctor is human like, not robot like. They show they care. They show that they aren't perfect but they try to do what is best for me.
0.560000	I think doctors sometimes have people's best interest but not always. Sometimes they are too busy or in it for the money they can milk depends
0.720000	I trust my family doctor because I have had health issues come up or things that have bothered me for awhile and other family doctor's couldn't seem to help fix or get the right medication for the problem but this doctor has helped me every time, so I feel she knows what she is doing and I trust her.
0.800000	I believe that most doctors are good hearted; they do their best for the patient, Iâve only have a few bad moments with some doctors, but in general they are to be trusted.
0.800000	He has taken the time out to really make sure I understood concepts by drawing pictures, which I haven't experienced with other doctors. He is against the use of certain medications that are addictive, but the most helpful in situations. I needed an anti anxiety medicine that would help and he preferred to prescribe medicine that did not really help rather than giving me medicine that absolutely would. 
0.800000	I have had my doctors for several years now. We've built a relationship and I do trust them to share information with me freely and that we will choose the best course of action together. 
0.920000	My primary caregiver has been honest and straight forward since my first visit years ago. I visited for a large splinter that had become infected in my leg. Instead of recommending a costly incision to remove it, he first recommended antibiotics to help the swelling go down with hopes to remove it naturally. I appreciate someone who goes down every possible path to ensure you get the care you need, not the most expensive.
0.360000	Many times they simply do not listen to concerns especially in relation to medications. They tend to trust too much in medications that can cause serious side effects and don't realize how much they can negatively impact your life. Specifically I was given medication that was not working well for me but the doctor kept telling me to give it time. I listened and regretted it. I lost most of my hair and gained about 40 pounds by the time I gave up and stopped taking the medication. The doctor was not empathetic or concerned about the effects but the experience had a very negative and lasting affect on my life. I've had more than my share of negative outcomes due to poor medical advice. My son also went through years of unnecessary treatment due to a misdiagnosis. So I can't say that I fully trust any doctor's medical advice.
0.520000	"Because many doctors are either a) trying to get through patients as quickly as possible; b) trying the safest (and not always most effective) solutions that minimize their own liability; c) have a ""band aid"" approach to medicine that treats symptoms rather than the underlying cause, and d) depend on medications and writing prescriptions. Furthermore, most doctors are not interested in preventative care and have very little good advice on nutrition. "
0.800000	My doctor seems to be very personable and has my best interest in mind.  She is very down to earth and is someone I can talk to easily.  I think she is doing what is best for my current health, and I know she is educated to make those decisions.  Doctors in general I have dealt with I usually trust.  There have been a few exceptions, but if I don't have a good fit I seek a 2nd opinion.
0.680000	I feel like doctors often dismiss what a patient is saying- and roll with their accumulated knowledge of what is actually happening with a patient's medical issue. You can almost see them smirk at times when you describe something.
0.400000	Personally, I distrust my primary care doctor because she is always in a hurry and rarely takes the time out of to fully listen to me. She is always leaving the room and doing multiple things at once not being fully immersed in my care. 
0.760000	I trust my care physician because they go above and beyond what I expect or what I am even interested in.  My physician is completely thorough during my physical and I feel like they want to give the best care possible.
0.800000	I had the chance to review other physicians before choosing the actual one. I have also learned from a close family ember about my doctor's qualities. He indeed proved to be very professional and also close to his patients.
0.840000	I feel like my doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and address them. He doesn't blow off what I say even if it takes us a little while to figure out what is going on.
0.720000	Faith based, honest, she is very thourough when I come in to see her seems concerning. The nurses aid is very helpful as well. If u don't have trust in your doctor then you need to change
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because this person has had many, many years of school, and dedicated their life to making sure they explore, examine and treat those that are in their care for different illnesses. I have little medical knowledge so I always listen to my physician. However, that doesn't mean I listen blindly. I always do my own research and get a second opinion.  
0.480000	Doctors are taught to go by numbers or by what testing says.  They do not listen to what their patients symptoms.  I have hypothyroidism and have normal numbers but I still have symptoms.  My doctor insists that my symptoms have nothing to do with my thyroid.  I have done my own research and know for a fact that other thyroid patients have symptoms despite having normal numbers.   I wish my doctor would listen to my symptoms and not my numbers
0.720000	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind but at times they have to many patients and to many things going on and they make quick decisions that may not always be the right one even if they think it was at the time  
0.320000	I believe the medical field is too dependent on money, creating big profits while minimizing care to patients.  This trickles down most heavily on the doctors who make the call to run certain tests or not and to dedicate enough time to caring for patients.  I believe there is too much pressure on doctors to overmedicate patients as well.
0.720000	"Normally and previously I have had total confidence in her. However recently my medical needs have started to conflict with what is ""popular"" to do because of certain topics in the media. Though no one has told me that is the reason. I have been given NO reason why I'm being denied effective treatment. "
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician. My primary care physician always tells me what is going on with my health and answers all of my questions. She recommends things and tells me how I might feel during procedures which turned out to be true.
0.800000	I have seen the same physician for 25 years and he has a limited number of patients as he is in semi-retirement. He takes his time and asks questions and explains things in terms the average person can understand.
0.800000	I know him personally as a friend and have worked with him in the past, before he was a doctor. So I also know him professionally.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is caring and seems very wise. She has been a doctor for many years and always has good answers to my questions. I've verified many things she's told me on websites such as Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins and she is always correct.
0.760000	I like that the dr takes the time to listen and make sure to understand what is going on and to make me feel like a person that can get better and do well.
0.800000	I have a big trust in my doctor because he has chosen his profession because he wants to help people achieve good health and good life.  I feel that my doctor has no reason to give me something that would jeopardize my health and my life.
0.680000	I just started with a new doctor and I like her a good bit. However, this has not been the case in general with doctors giving me medications without telling me what exactly they're meant to solve, what interactions I should be aware of, or what side effects to expect. I end up doing a tremendous amount of googling to make sure I'm not missing something. 
0.640000	I trust them because they know more than me but am still apprehensive at times. As long as they listen to me. 
0.800000	The doctor I have now asks about the family and seems to remember things about them. Seems to care about me taking care of myself. That comes across in his tone and approach to the visits.
0.440000	Doctors now days are taught to get a patient in and out.  Very few take the time to really hear what you are saying and even fewer spend the time that is needed to find out what the root problem is.  They usually give you some med and it is just a band-aid and you will have to come back at a later time.  Some older physicians still take time but most of the young ones do not.
0.880000	I trust my physician because they never rush me. I trust my physician because they always take time to explain complicated diagnoses or procedures to me. I trust my physician because they always smile whenever we interact. I trust my physician because they are great with going the extra mile to make sure I confident in my healthcare decisions by making sure I fully understand and risks associated.
0.480000	I feel like doctors today are too busy.  They aren't thorough on examinations and do not make sure you understand what they are telling you.  Their practice earns money in volume so they move people in and out as fast as possible.
0.280000	I distrust the medical profession because it is one solely funded by and has become the face of big pharma, who pushes its poisonous pills via sales bonuses to doctors who write a certain number of scripts. The medical profession as it stands is a front for the biggest drug cartel that is responsible for more deaths than any other, the fda and big pharma  
0.840000	I completely trust my Doctor because my Doctor haven't given me any reason not to. My Doctor has never prescribed me something or recommend any kind of treatment that I was skeptical of, everything my Doctor has said to me I didn't really have reason to question it.  
0.640000	I don't distrust my doctor, but he's human and no one knows everything. When it comes to my health, if its a serious issue not just a cold, I always want to get another opinion. 
0.600000	I some what trust but sometimes I feel like I am not being heard and the doctor is always in such a rush that he doesn't listen to me
0.840000	i trust my doctor, she seems very capable and have a lot of knowledge, i always follow her instructions and get better
0.840000	My doctor has shown to be really caring and trustworthy over the years that I have known him. He has never led me wrong and always seems to know what he's talking about involving my health.
0.880000	I find my self without any reason whatsoever as to why I should not trust my doctor. I have always followed his transcriptions and every time I get cured. I therefore have gained a lot of confidence and trust in him. 
0.760000	I researched my condition and I was given a treatment plan that included medication and one that included a natural change in my diet. This was the same research that I did prior to consulting with my doctor. Thus, no medication or plan is being forced upon me. Also, I was able to express my discomfort with the medication that I was using and I was switched to a different medication. 
0.720000	I trust them for the most part. It's an extreme amount of school and experience required to be one so they aren't messing around. Though, sometimes, they are in a rush and your problem may be really low acuity in their eyes so they may hastily treat you.
1.000000	I haven't been to my primary care physician in a while due to no longer having health insurance, but I'll do my best to explain. I typically take good care of myself and try to avoid going to the doctor's office at all costs. The main reason that I would visit her is because of my IBS, which is something that she also suffers from, so I know that she understands what I'm going through. More generally, you never feel like you're being rushed. She always listens to whatever you need to say about your issues, no matter how long you go on about it.
0.760000	So far Iâve only had minor medical issues and in all cases the doctors have been very willing to explain everything and answer all my questions.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because she knows me really well. She has been my doctor since I was 4 years old so she knows the ins and outs of all my health issues better than any other doctor. On a personal level, she has been there for me in times of need and has gone above and beyond her call of duty.
0.760000	In general I trust my primary care physician as they have demonstrated their honesty in the past. Additionally, I trust most doctors in general. Furthermore, it takes a certain type of personality to be a primary care physician. They are stereotypically honest, trustworthy, and caring.
0.800000	In a couple of different appointments, I've asked about certain treatments or options for ailments and my doctor is very forthcoming.  Normally if he thinks it's overpriced hogwash, he'll give me his honest opinion.  He's also happily given me referrals to doctor's offices and recommendations to quality referrals for things that are recommended like an annual skin screening to proactively prevent skin cancer.  I think sometimes doctor's can be a little pill happy to offer them unnecessarily, but mine is usually more calculated and cares about finding a solution. In addition, his thoroughness actually saved a friend's life of mine when she had been complaining and struggling through a health problem with her other doctor, he uncovered a serious situation and got her the care she needed.
0.800000	In general I trust my primary care physician. I haven't had a reason ever to distrust him. He has always been helpful and courteous, I think the care is of good quality.
0.840000	I think that my primary care physician sometimes doesn't take my interests into account. That makes me feel like my doctor isn't completely trustworthy. I have told them about how I've tried solutions that they suggest, but I am not receiving alternative solutions after saying so.
1.000000	I like my primary care physician, he treats me fairly and gives me good advice. He also lets me know when he feels I need to do something to improve my health.
0.800000	I like my COP because he seems to care. He doesn't rush me. If he's unable to give me an answer, he has no issue Googling it to figure out a good solution instead of insisting it's not true or he knows better. His humour doesn't hurt either. 
0.760000	My doctor has found and been able to diagnoses what other doctors just left untreated..I completely trust my Doctor and his team of staff.I would recommend anybody and everybody to my doctor.
0.920000	the dr I refer to is my oncologist who has treated me for Stage IV breast cancer that is metastatic.  It will be 6 yrs in July that I was diagnosed and also had major surgery to remove a mass in my colon that was also cancerous.  I feel without their careful and thoughtful medical expertise I may not be alive.  I see my oncologist to check my lab levels and also to receive the next round of oral chemotherapy.  I feel it is in my best interest to trust him and I do.
0.640000	I donât anyone should have complete trust in doctors. Different doctors can offer different opinions. A lot of doctors are also in the pocket of large pharmaceutical companies. 
0.680000	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel like she dismisses a lot of what I say except for what she wants to hear and treat. For example, I suffer from depression and anxiety and all she does is prescribe medication that doesn't work. Sometimes my anxiety is out of control and I get very little sleep. I have a medication that is not working for me and she just keeps adjusting the dosage and it still doesn't help. This has been going on for over a year. She takes my high blood pressure and cholesterol very serious but doesn't give me much help other than a diet and exercise and medicine. The practice has also become much more busy than it used to be and I feel like sometimes her mind is someplace else because of that.
0.800000	My primary care physician has always helped me with my problems or illnesses.  She is conservative and will start with the easiest remedy to see if that works first but is always open to taking the next step.  She listens to and answers my questions and seems to care about me.
0.800000	I have a few doctors I see regularly. They are all very dependable, capable, and intelligent. I don't see any reason not to trust them.
0.640000	He spends a long time with me and makes sure I have a lot of reading material to take home. He makes sure in depth that everything is okay and makes sure to run regular tests.
0.560000	I think she is fine. Sometimes rushed or doesnât always listen to what I want or make me feel heard, but does what she can.
0.640000	I trust doctors because that's the only gap between dying from a cold and living with cancer. I believe doctors are really important and valuable to the world for the sense of security and safety. They are the closest things to magicians due to the miracle they are able to perform.
0.520000	Do not think they give you a lot to pick from as they get a kick back for the drugs the prescribe. Would get at least 3 different opinions before I would make a decision.
0.440000	When I offer another doctors opinion he immediately tells me they are wrong without explanation. He prescribes medications like they are candy. He gets very angry and impatient with questions or not understanding. He refuses to hear the issues I am there to see him for in full. I am cut off and he starts a physical exam instead of hearing me out. 
0.480000	The Primary Care physician I saw for 12 years moved too far away for me to see him regularly or when I'm sick.  I changed to someone in the same group but closer geographically. It's a totally bad fit!  He goes by the numbers and doesn't really listen to what's going on with me like symptoms, etc.  He refers me to specialists for health care problems he should be able to manage.  He is very quick to write prescriptions for problems that require more examination and assessment. The practice wants patients to use a patient portal to message doctors.  He answers my questions in very short, often, one word answers. I'm already shopping for a new primary care physician.   
0.720000	I've known and had them my whole life and things they've done for me before have been successful so i have reason to believe they will continue to be
0.800000	I for the most part trust my primary care physician. They always seem to give me the best information and always give me the correct treatment for my illnesses. 
0.760000	For the most part, I trust my current primary care physician because her medical examinations always seem thorough enough, and she has always prescribed medications and treatments that have turned out to be helpful and never harmful. However there are a few issues I've brought up repeatedly that have not particularly been addressed. I assume that she believes those issues are not a big deal; whether they are as harmless as she seems to think, I can't be sure since I'm no medical expert. For now I'd prefer to just go along with her advice. I have been seen by some very poor quality physicians in the past, and my PCP is definitely not one of those. I generally don't put a lot of trust in people, but I trust my PCP more than most.
0.720000	I do trust my doctors. I went to the same doctor for 21 years and when I turned 21 I was referred to a new doctor by my old doctor who I had good communication with and I believe that he referred me to a new doctor because he understood what I needed as a patient and that this doctor could help me. 
0.600000	I don't totally trust my primary care physician mostly because I don't know him well enough. He took over when my long time primary care physician retired. What I do know of him is that he is nice enough but always in a hurry and I swear he just looks at his computer and checks off what blood tests I need. If he touches me physically at all it is to listen with his stethoscope and to feel my neck. That's it. Not that I want him to examine every part of me every time, but maybe a bit more thoroughness and a human touch? It's a good thing I'm proactive because if I didn't mention and point out specific problems that should be obvious to a trained physician, I don't think he'd notice.
0.880000	My primary care doctor is always willing to take as much time as we need at each appointment to cover all of my medical concerns. She is also always willing to listen to any concerns I have and doesn't brush me off.
0.680000	My doctor is very straight forward and honest but he's not rude about how he explains things to you. He always explains situations to the best he can so that you understand what needs to be done. 
0.800000	He asks me questions about myself and my family with genuine interests. He asks me my opinion and explains things to me without me asking. His team seems knowledgeable and coordinated. I feel like more than a number or source of income.
0.760000	I trust my doctor, although sometimes I feel patient care is just a revolving door to them. They see thousands and thousands every year, day an day out. Sometimes it is hard to get them to call you back or even schedule an appointment that has to be months away. I have seen a lot more younger doctors over the years that have more energy and stamina to take on new patients than the doctors that have been around for decades. There needs to be a change in primary care.
0.600000	I chose neutral because I currently do not have a primary care doctor. My medical needs are usually taken care of at an Immediate Care center due to health insurance.
0.680000	I am cautiously trusting of my doctor's care for me, following up with questions if there are areas I feel she has not covered or been as thorough as needed. 
0.960000	I trust my physician completely. I have been sing the same doctor for many years. He knows were I stand with taking non nonessential medications, and antibiotics. I believe he respects that. He has never steered me wrong before. I have also never had any health issues other than an occasional cold. I also believe that a good education in the medical field is also a must have. My doctor has taken many courses and is very well rounded. He has a great amount of experience.  
0.520000	Well sometimes i feel as if my doctor doesn't take the time to really look at me i know they are in a hurry but they could spend just a little more time
0.840000	I haven't had too many experiences with doctors, let alone bad experiences. I trust doctors for the most part and tend to take whatever medicine they provide me with. But if that medicine isn't working, I'll start to doubt my doctor.
0.360000	I don't currently have a primary care physician because I switched insurance providers and still need to select one.  Basically, I've seen too many things go wrong with friends and relatives' doctors, and I'm pretty paranoid about doctors in general. I inherently don't trust them and want to avoid them. Also, I think I have a form of hypochondria where I'm always afraid of something being wrong and so just want to avoid it.
0.440000	I've had family members with doctors who have rushed them thru things, misdiagnosed or allowed very serious illnesses to remain undiagnosed, and not been careful enough in prescribing and monitoring the effect of medications. There are good doctors but I think in the US nowadays if you want to be assured you're getting the best care possible from your physician then you must be vigilant and persistent. I would be wary of any doctor even tho I know most don't mean to cause harm.
0.800000	My doctor is generally aware of my needs and the needs of my family. I always feel a level of personal care and attention when  I am in her office
0.400000	I've had a really devastating loss because my doctor suck. Or it's all my fault, and my body is just terrible. I really don't want to think about it, honestly.
0.800000	My PCP has been treating me a long time and has went out of her way to help me with new treatments and with exploring different treatment plans when traditional ones weren't working. She would also visit me during hospitalizations which has given me a lot of reasons to trust her and feel she is looking out for me. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she listens carefully to me, asks appropriate questions and does not dismiss my concerns.  She takes the time to get all pertinent information and thinks about my particular case before diagnosing or prescribing anything.
0.720000	I trust them to do the right thing because they studied a long time, took an oath to help patients, and should care about people.  I have to trust them.
0.920000	My doctor is completely honest with me no matter what as I allow him to be.  If Iâm over weight heâll tell me, if I have high blood pressure he will tell.  He tells me all these things looking me straight in they eyes and letâs me know all the bad things that can possibly happen if I donât do better. Death, stroke, being paralyzed.  This is why I trust my doctor 
0.800000	I do not have a primary care physician.  I do feel that the majority of doctors are going to try their best to do what is in the best interest of their patients. 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because she listens to my concerns and provides clear explanations and suggestions on how to overcome them.
0.440000	I was misdiagnosed with a condition for years and doctors refused to test for it. I have encountered many doctors and some understand more than others.
0.640000	I work in the medical field and I understand the way that pcps interact with their patients. Sometimes admin gets in the way of getting things done and this can impede the patient process, sometimes doctors are burnt out and are sacrificing patient outcomes for their own gains.
0.760000	I basically trust my primary care physician because she is extremely experienced and seems caring, and her treatment recommendations seem appropriate.
0.640000	I trsut my primary care doctor for the most part. However, i do feel as though they rush me out and dont take as much time as necessary.
0.840000	My doctor has shown me that she is thorough and caring. In the few times I have thought that she might be wrong on something - it turns out that she was right! As far as I am concerned, my doctor has a great batting average when it comes to health, so I am with her for the long haul. 
0.320000	"The doctor's clinic I go to often wants to run a bunch of tests which I think are often unnecessary. And because my insurance isn't that great, I end up paying thousands of dollars. Last year I had to pay $600 for a lyme disease test that my dr. thought I should get because I garden a lot. Every single time I go, a $40.00 charge for 'smoking counseling' shows up on my bill. But it is literally a five second conversation of ""You smoke?"" and me saying yes and the doctor saying ""you should quite"". No joke, nothing more than that 5 second sentence and they charge 40.00. I think it is a huge scam. "
0.600000	Again, it comes down to the fact that people can lie.  People on this planet have an ultimate goal in mind and that is to make money.  So, if a doctor is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and are essentially drug dealers, how could you trust that person ever?
0.640000	It it their job and I like to believe they have moral standards and wouldnt sway me towards something wrong.
0.400000	For the most part, I do trust my primary care physician.  I believe the physician has my best interest overall.  That being said, I still question my doctor on certain decisions to make sure I agree with the decision.  I am not afraid to question my doctor or do more research about certain decisions my doctor wants me to follow.
0.760000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. They spend ample time listening to any symptoms or issues that I have to present before making any form of diagnoses or prescribing medications. They also take the time to fully explain any diagnoses to me at that time. 
0.560000	My primary care physician is kind and he listens but I feel he is often in a hurry and hears my words but only the ones that he wants to. He wants to order more test on top of more tests and sends me to other doctors that I can not afford even after I express to him that I do not have the finances to go to others. 
0.640000	The medical field in my observation us more focused on insurance and getting paid well rather than helping people. It is all about how much money the medical field can get and with insurance how much the insurances can save on patients.
0.760000	i trust him too much because of the years, what he has advice me had never proving to be false. he is so caring and approachable. he tell me what is needed and not what i wants to hear. he is such a wonderful man. also he put patience first before money.
1.000000	My doctor is a very down to earth person. I think that he and I have a lot in common. We are able to talk freely with him and have agreed on almost everything that we have every talked about. The decisions that he has made thus far I have agreed with and would anticipate that he would continue to make decisions in the future that I agree with.
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician she is always so helpful and nice. She has been with me for a very long time. Ive been with her for over 10 years. She has helped me through a lot of medical issues I have had.
0.680000	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I expect and believe that doctors want to help people and be honest with them about their medical conditions. But, they can be busy or overworked. They might be a bit busy and not focus as much on patients as they would like.
1.000000	I have gone to the same doctor my entire life. He has been my family's doctor for many years. My family and I trust him completely. He has always been very honest and has always taken the time to answer all my questions.
0.760000	I agree for the most part that doctors are looking out for their patients and can be trusted, but I do think like all human beings sometimes they are working in their own interests.  For example, my regular doctor used to recommend removing moles even if they are not a problem (cancerous or pre-cancerous), but when I mentioned that I am on high deductible insurance and these procedures come out of my pocket, she conceded that this mole removal is not needed.
0.760000	I trust that most doctors truly have their patient's well being in mind when they recommend courses of action. Most doctors that I have seen have been very open with me about my treatment options and about finding what is affordable for me at the time.
0.680000	I think that they are not intentionally trying to do wrong by me. However, I do know that doctors often do not have the time to keep up to date with all of the latest advances in healthcare. So it's important to double-check any recommendations yourself.
0.720000	Generally, i do trust my physician, but I also feel that they see me so rarely, and see so many other patients, that they are not able to provide the best recommendation.
0.760000	When I had serious medical complications, my doctor sent me to a specialist rather than trying to deal with the situation himself. I feel confident that he actually cares about my well-being.
0.760000	I place trust in my doctor, but have not done so blindly. I take everything with a grain of salt, at least initially. I have been with my PCP for a significant amount of time now, an dI understand and trust their judgement when it comes to matters of my health, though I could not say the same for other doctors with whom I am not a patient. I mainly base my trust on my experience with my PCP, which has been by far one of the best 'professional' relationships I have had in my life.
0.920000	I know him personally, he goes to our church and we have his home phone number.   He is great with our boys, always has a second to talk if we have a concern, is thorough but not overbearing, hasnt been wrong about anything yet and you can tell he genuinely cares about us.
0.520000	I want to be able to fully trust my doctors but sometimes when I ask for further information about my specific problem, they don't seem to want to go into details which makes me doubt them. I also feel when they try to lump things to past problems I've been dealing with instead of looking at the problem individually I begin to distrust their judgement. 
0.520000	I never fully trust a doctor because I know they are just human beings. As a lawyer, I understand that there are many people who can go through medical school and come out under-qualified.
0.600000	I do think doctors have a lot of pressure to get one patient done and move onto the next; hence lapses in high quality service.  My doctor is careful, but could probable be a little more detailed.  Also, I can do research on my own to determine what medication I need and know my medical history well enough to know what medication doesn't work well or causes a reaction.  
0.360000	My dr and i believe that most dr's are too by the book.  They see a person as a payment or a number rather than an individual. This causing them to just use us as test subjects to kind of see what works rather than really getting to know us and our bodies. 
0.800000	I don't see my PCP often, but when I do he is very straightforward with me. He expresses his concerns if he has any. He then gives a list of options for treatment(s) and allows me to decide which course to follow. If there are any issues I have a variety of ways in which I can reach out to him and he is prompt at responding.
0.440000	The doctor has a quota of patients that he has to see to make a profit for the day. this leads to the doctor spending less time than is possibly needed to fully aid a patient
0.800000	I have not had a reason not to  trust him, everything he has recommended thus far has been accurate with no reason to question his decisions.  
0.600000	I feel I haven't seen my newest Dr. enough to have complete trust in them. They do give me my options and seem knowledgeable in what they are doing. I do however always have some worries as to if sometimes they are just being paid by some drug companies to give certain meds out or prescribe certain treatments.
0.360000	I feel like my doctor is in a hurry. She is wanting to get through with the exam and move on to the next patient. If I ask a question, she rushes through the answer. I can always tell she is focused on getting to the next person. So I don't necessarily trust her to be thorough or careful.
0.920000	I have never personally had an experience with a doctor that would make me not trust a doctor's advise.  I believe that in general doctors do have their patients best interest in mind. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor, all in all i have gotten what i needed from him. He's always been right about my health and given me the right medication. The only thing is that he's always in a rush wished he would spend a little more time answering my questions.
0.800000	I do feel at ease with my doctor. I have known her for many years so she knows how my body reacts to things. How I feel about things. I believe in her judgement. 
0.640000	I trust my primary physician because he is honest with me and tries to help me as much as he can. I also get to freely engage him when i have a problem
0.640000	well sometimes its hard to trust on your primary care physician because they cant guarantee your health back and even other doctors wont  take responsibility they can just try their best to take care of a person
0.880000	I have seen her for a long time and she's consistently shown a lot of care. She always listens to my questions, even the seemingly silly sounding ones, and answers honestly.
0.760000	I feel i can trust my PCP. She is being very honest with me about options and potential results. I feel i already established a personal connection with her
0.480000	I want to have full trust in my primary doctor but I feel like some training is outdated.  I feel that pharmaceutical companies influence doctors greatly.  I've experienced a situation where I was not given all my options and I feel surgery was recommended and pushed to make money.  I feel like it's too much about making money and less about making people healthy.  Especially considering the fact that Americans are growing more and more unhealthy - kids and adults alike.
0.600000	My doctor recently left her practice so I will be seeing a new doctor. In addition, I always feel that a doctor is trying to get through as many patients as possible. 
0.600000	I have the utmost trust in the group of  nurse midwives that I see for my primary gynecological care and for the birth of my son.  I believe their values perfectly align with my own and I trust them implicitly with medical decisions.  I trust most doctors less.
0.720000	I recently moved and do not have a primary care physician. I think doctors in general have the patient's best interest in mind. I have enjoyed working with most of my doctors, but I have occasionally felt rushed during appointments. Therefore, there has been occasional distrust.
0.720000	I would definitely trust my health care physician because they are the people I could ask help whenever I feel sick. My health care physician was the reason why i am still standing in this planet. I have a good relationships with her and also to my family since when I was young.
0.680000	I feel like I need to trust them because that is what they have studied and trained to do for many years. Though I have experienced negative situations in hospitals that have made me feel somewhat distrustful. I have been present in situations where a doctor has taken too long or has not demonstrated much importance when trying to be reached with questions. Sometimes they have so many situations going on at once, that it would seem they forget some patients.
0.600000	Doctor has given bad advice a couple of times, such as don't read about side effects. I don't have anything else to say.
0.480000	"Generally speaking, doctors are a product of their systems and culture. They often see themselves as godlike figures, incapable of being questioned, and the environments where they work, with their constant reverence for doctors, reinforce that mentality. This, combined with their fear of liability often makes them completely averse to anything new or different, even when the literature and research show that there is significant potential benefit. I feel that more doctors are concerned about ""not rocking the boat"" than doing what is best for the patient. There are, of course, stellar exceptions, and I have been fortunate to work with some of them.   "
0.760000	My Primary Care Physician is an exception to the rule. Nearly all other physicians I've encountered would have received the exact opposite scores. My physician runs a small-town cash-only clinic, removing insurance from the process altogether and creating a much better Doctor-Patient relationship in the process.
0.600000	I do generally trust my doctor, but I know there's a lot he doesn't know, and the same goes for most doctors. So I always supplement whatever information/recommendations he gives me with additional research to get a bigger picture. Doctors generally overprescribe medication, which usually has side effects and can do more harm than good in the long run, so I want to know exactly what I'll get into if I make a certain choice.
0.200000	Doctors come in an listen to you for barely 5 minutes, then do some perfunctory examinations like check blood pressure and come to a decision on your situation.  Its obvious often doctors have no clue on how to diagnose a non-visible symptom like stomach pain or neurological issues.  They just tend to prescribe yah a prescription and rush you out the door.  The prescription might do more harm than good too.  Its clear that some of the doctors I have fit this profile and aren't very circumspect or patient oriented.
0.800000	I've known my primary care physician most of my life, and he has never given me a reason not to trust him. 
0.920000	I moved to this city 13 years ago and have been seeing this doctor for all my health care needs, apart from my dentist and eye doctor. She answers all my questions patiently and never hurries through the appointment.
0.760000	I find that my PCP has a genuine interest to see that I am as healthy as I can be.  She listens to my problems and seems to expend the appropriate amount of concern and energy into solving my problems.  She will also freely give prescriptions or referrals when I need to see a specialist.
0.800000	I been seeing my doctor for several years.  He has always been helpful and profession when my family or I are sick.
0.840000	I trusted my former primary care physician, but I didn't put all of my trust in him. God is first in my life and my trust is in Him, but to a certain degree I trusted my former primary care physician, because he always seemed to be honest in telling me about all different treatment options available and the results of my blood tests. 
0.720000	I pretty much trust my primary care doctor. She is friendly and easy to talk to. Sometimes I do feel like she is a little preoccupied with other things and in a hurry. But over all I think I receive adequate care from her.  
0.240000	The primary care physicians are going to spend as little time with patients as possible.  They are busy and dont have time to explain everything or care about every patient.  If the doctor prescribes me a drug or suggests a certain treatment I will do thorough research on my own time and make my own decision about my course of treatment.
0.320000	The few times I have visited the doctor I have felt a sense of urgency from them as if they were too busy for my time. I also feel like they do not care as much as they should, too many times have I experienced a doctor telling me a bunch of information at once like they were a robot, not making any eye contact with me through the lecture. 
0.840000	I have along history with my doctor and I know now i can trust him on what he says and I am always the one to ask questions and at time confirm what he says by reading more on the subject
0.800000	I trust my doctor because for the most part he has been on the mark with health problems that I have had. Once he had an intern from a local school take a look at me. She had difficulty diagnosing me so she went to get him. As soon as he walked in to the room, he saw me from a distance and called out what I had - again from a distance. He was dead right. My doctor knows his stuff and also has a sense of humor.
0.760000	I have been seeing my current primary care physician for nearly 4 years. She is very competent, compassionate, and will send me to specialists if I have medical problems that she cannot treat. 
0.880000	I feel like I have to trust him.  I am allowing him to look after my health.  If I didn't trust that his decisions or education was good enough I would happily find a new doctor.
0.680000	my primary caretaker is very awesome! She is always down to earth and gives it to me straight. The only negative thing I have against her is she is not for using medicine as much. If it can be done, she would rather the body heal itself naturally. This is ok sometimes but when I have a dance concert coming up there is just not enough time so I don't want to have to argue about giving me medicine. 
0.960000	I have been around physicians all my life. Iâve volunteered in hospitals, worked in hospitals, job-shadowed various doctors, and have numerous doctors as colleagues (Iâm in medical school). I have a primary care physician and whenever I have a checkup etc. with my own knowledge I know he tells me the truth and shows a caring side, and answers all my questions. Trust is earned, and I believe (since I am doing it), with all the education doctors go through, trust should be there, because it is a respected occupation. 
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician, therefore I marked all of the above items as neutral. I've personally been friends with several doctors in my life, and the reality is they are people like everyone else, and as a result my trust in them depends on their ethics and character. Some doctors are very caring and insightful, some are full of ego that blinds them truly looking and understanding a case before them. And all degrees in between. Should I ever need to see a doctor, I will to a great deal of research on them before consenting to be their patient.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him since I was a kid and he has been truthful and honest ever since. He has also been my family's primary care physician.
0.320000	I don't have much trust in my former mainstream (allopathic) doctor mainly because of the way information in allopathic medicine is taught, from a top down and 'condition-osis' perspective.  There is no such thing in mainstream medicine as understanding a situation from the ground up.  Instead, a description of a condition is projected onto the patient and care is given based on that projection.  My doctor did absolutely nothing for me in regards to my scoliosis that got so bad my entire rib cage began to slip out of place.  Instead of seeing what was there, he acted on the preconceived notion of what scoliosis was and the problems it can cause.
0.760000	I trust them to do their jobs. I have confidence in them unless they give me a reason not to. I believe they have their patient's best interesting in mind. 
0.800000	One of the reasons I distrust a lot of Physicians is because in this day, I fear, mostly they are after money. So more test's, more this, more that, try this try that, I fear its all about the money. I wish it wasn't so. But mostly I feel this way. But not about everyone.
0.200000	I distrust my PCP and the conventional medical doctors because they are only trained in drugs and surgery.  It is a big business and no one is allowed to deviate from it even if the results are in the best interest of the patient. You look around and see so many people sick, how can I trust the doctors?  Doctors still think soda is ok to drink!
0.720000	I generally trust doctors, but I don't believe you should trust anyone 100%, without at least verifying their information with another expert at least once or twice, every so often.
0.840000	I completely trust my doctor. I believe that if you don't trust them,  u should find one that you do. Mine gives me an honest opinion, backed by facts and not just suggestions. They give me solid advise and are patient with me. They take the time to sit with u and listen to your problems and questions. Thru don't always want to shove a pill down your throat, they respect my natural path of doing things. 
0.640000	I have been recently assigned a new provider. As far as I can tell, he is a very competent doctor. He has been very helpful in my medications and I have not experienced any problems under this current provider.
0.920000	I have had my primary physician for 20 plus years. During that time he has always listened to my concerns, shared his concerns and always made the correction decisions to improve my various health issues. He is kind and considerate and truly cares about mew and his other patients
0.880000	My doctor listens to me and spends a good amount of time with me instead of just rushing along the appointment. She always asks me if I have any questions and addresses every one of them if I do. When I call the office for a need, I always get assistance over the phone in a timely manner.
0.800000	I do not go very often to a doctor, but I have the same family doctor since I was quite young, and I believe he has always done a good job helping me to maintain good health, and warning me of risks and dangers posed by my behaviors.
0.560000	He is constricted by the corporation that employs him. He's clearly under a great deal of pressure, probably dealing with more patients than he can comfortably deal with. 
0.440000	Often feel rushed or forgotten by my doctor's office. It's packed and I have a hard time getting anyone on the phone or talking to busy staff while I'm there. I ferl like one in hundreds of patients they see in a week. I wait for literal hours for my appointments and spend maybe 30 minutes being seen.
0.520000	I've worked in healthcare (previously) for over 15 years, and have had first-hand experience with many doctors.  I've seen a side of doctors that patients don't see, and some of these interactions have fostered a lack of trust.  I've had experiences where I've gone to see a new doctor and they've had a prescription written for me before I even spoke to them.  I've seen my husband prescribed contraindicated medications that caused an adverse reaction that even I knew shouldn't be taken together.  But, alternatively, I've had some doctors who treated me well who I've really trusted.  I've known other doctors to go out of their way to cater to their patient's needs/fears/wishes.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to talk to me about all aspects of my health, and helps me look into a multitude of treatment options, where applicable. He is very experienced, and takes the time to listen to me (which can be rare in doctors). I get the feeling that my family's and my own health are important to him.
0.880000	I had the same doctor for the last 12 years. He has always taken good care of me. I think of him more like a family friend than just my primary care doctor. When I had lower back pain problem and couldn't sleep, he referred me to a really good chiropractor and physical therapist. I put a lot of trust in his diagnostic and advice because he is almost always correct with his assessment.   
0.560000	I can't say I completely trust my general doctor, I mean, he has given me good attention for a whole year and he treats me well but sometimes I think he cares more about making money than myself as he makes me do many tests in the same hospital where he is. It's kind of suspicious.
0.760000	My doctor is a great doctor and she truly cares about her patients.  I have developed a good relationship with her and she lets me know that she is always there for her patients
0.880000	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor, and it was because he went against my wishes. Other than that one experience, my normal doctor listens to me completely, and always has insightful advice or resources for me to utilize.
0.320000	 As a poor citizen of the United States I like millions of my fellow countryman probably avoid seeing doctors as much as possible. The cost of health care is insane and the treatment that is given to lower class individuals is often not very good. I can say this from first hand experience as told in my previous statement. Doctors often seem to care more about money than about the ethical side of their profession which is to help people. I feel there is a large disconnect between healthcare needs and healthcare providers in this country. Doctors taking hand outs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe their drugs is a huge conflict of interests. Healthcare should not be a for profit business but rather a human right. Until this concept is realized in this country and in the rest of the world who is falling behind the general public will continue to not trust doctors and not seek medical help. Going into crippling debt for simply seeing a doctor is not an option for most people.
0.760000	My primary doctor is my OBGYN and she is amazing. She listens to my concerns and takes them seriously. Whereas other doctors would gloss over my anxieties/fears, she will go the extra mile to make sure I am well taken care of, even if that means transferring my care to someone else.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have seen the same one for twenty years. He has always been very thorough for regarding any issue that I have. During my pregnancies he was never too pushy about what he thought was best, and let me make the decisions. He is always a good listener when it comes to my concerns, and never rushes me out of his office. 
0.760000	my doctor has been very open and honest with me about my health and the things i should be doing and avoiding. she does not sugar coat anything but she is also compassionate when relating her message across to me which makes me feel more comfortable and apt to listening to her medical advice.
0.560000	Sometimes it seems like he is pushing pharmaceutical trials on me. He does not always seem genuinely interested in my welfare, although we make small talk often.
0.800000	I trust doctors because they have the most knowledge on what is best for my condition. There is so much conflicting information that a healthcare professional is the only source of an effective care solution. If I want to recover as quickly as possible then following doctors orders is the best method.
0.600000	My physician is trustworthy but I do feel she can be pre occupied with what makes her life easier at times
0.760000	I trust my Doctor because I believe he has been completely honest . He is willing to admit when he doesn't have the answer to all of my health concerns and doesn't hesitate to direct me to other Dr. that can treat my health problems.
0.600000	I'm not entirely happy with my primary care physician because he doesn't always take the time I would like him to take with me.  It is a busy practice. I am currently looking for a new doctor who will be willing to spend time answering my questions.  A doctor who will listen to me and not just assume I don't know what i'm talking about when it comes to my health.
0.680000	I do trust my doctor almost completely, you have to if you are not going to go crazy. But I know in the back of my mind no one has my best interest at heart but me. 
0.800000	I'm active duty military and see my doctor at the base hospital. I feel as though they honestly care about me and my fellow military members and do what is best for our health and long term care. I have no reasons to doubt this or experienced anything to discredit this opinion and view.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she will explain all options to me and also make sure that she understands who I am as her patient. She also makes sure that her staff is also aware of who I am as a patient. 
0.560000	I try to ask questions to get the best information, but am not always sure that I have done so. My primary care physician and doctors in general tend to rush appointments and have subordinates reply to me with answers that are sometimes inadequate. My trust is therefore about 50-50.
0.800000	My doctor is fairly conservative in treating most issues initially. On the other hand, he is proactive and quick to address problems needing immediate attention and action. He also believes in natural solutions over pharmaceuticals whenever possible.
0.520000	I always feel so rushed during consultations that I feel distrustful of his advice.  Can he really be that careful with my care in fifteen minutes?
0.800000	My doctor takes the time to actively listen to me and to address my concerns. I don't feel like a number or like I'm being rushed. He takes the time to explain things to me in a way I understand and is empathetic to what I say.
0.800000	I like my doctor, we have a private practice doctor, so I feel we get lucky and get extra time he doesn't seem to rush me and I feel he listens to me when I go in to see him.  I also like that I see only him, so he can look back from last time he saw me or review his notes, that gives me confidence that something won't be missed
0.440000	I utilize different professional medical settings (i.e. urgent care, hospital, offices) and have had multiple bad experiences, both personal and of my friends. It seems as though many doctors rush through without properly analyzing the situation, or push for the more costly of treatments. Medicine has taken quite a plunge in recent years, and the Hippocratic Oath does not mean what it once meant. 
0.840000	My primary care physician has been efficient but thorough the last two years that I've been seeing her. She listens to my concerns, offers treatment options, and describes pros/cons of available options. Her manner is very pleasant and she balances speaking in vernacular terms and medical terms so as to neither come across as confusing or patronizing. 
0.440000	I don't always trust everything the doctor says and seem to spend more time talking to the nurse asking questions. The doctors seem to think they know everything and don't ask many questions. I't understandable they seem pressed for time as I can understand why that would be true. I do think that is the main reson for a lack of trust though it may not always be true.
1.000000	I trust her because she has been my doctor for Two years and even delivered my son. She has always made sure I was in good hands and made me feel comfortable to talk about my health to
0.800000	It took me a while to get to a point where I felt okay with this doctor; my previous doctor died and I switched to the current doctor, who was in the same practice, and we clashed at first. But now we understand each other better. Also, I got treated for my trypanophobia (fear of medical needles) and since then I am better able to trust doctors in general.
0.840000	She has always listened to what problems I am having.  She runs the tests necessary to diagnose my medical conditions and my general health.  She changes medications when needed to better treat my issues.  She seems to genuinely care about my health and well being.
0.360000	Doctors are busy and use mental shortcuts.  There is a large body of literature showing this.  Doctors are also generally very busy and shocking self-important, with little experience in the humility that actual scientists have.
0.760000	I'm very frank and open with her and she is with me, which is what I would expect and this makes me feel safe.  She asks tough questions and doesn't beat around the bush, gets to the point, and is very directive in what she believes is best for me.  I like this about her and am totally open with her.
0.600000	I have had a lot of bad experiences with doctors. I currently have a nurse practitioner that I like and trust. My experience began young when I had a doctor tell me on several occasions that I couldn't have whatever disorder I came to see him for. Such as telling me a thirteen year old can't have ulcers (I did). Once I had a doctor put me out of work for seven days for whooping cough as an adult, and when j explained to her I needed one more day to not get in trouble at work so I'd be on sick leave she denied it. There are other instances where I felt my voice wasn't heard. 
0.720000	I trust my Physician's because he's the one that take care of me health-wise, and make sure that I am on the right path and and in good health.
0.720000	My primary care physician sometimes seems to be in a hurry on days when he has a lot of patients to see, so he does not ask me many questions on those days. If I have any symptoms that are bothering me, then I would have to make sure to point them out to him myself when he is in a hurry. He always prescribes treatment or orders tests to learn what is wrong, so he can prescribe accurate medicines.
0.800000	He's been a osteopathic physician for many years and takes the time to listen to my concerns and suggest options for treatment.  He's open-minded and not the least bit dismissive.  His judgment is sound and his demeanor is caring. 
1.000000	My group of doctors work together to get me the care needed. They toss ideas around with each other so there is always a second and third opinion before we move forward with anything in the event that I do get sick.
0.640000	he is a doctor and he know what to do and how to treat so i trust him/her but i also do my research on it and seek out the treatment  
1.000000	I think that my doctor takes the time to listen to me . She does a good job going over each problem and giving me options . She will explain each one and recommend what she thinks I should do . She is good with following up . If I feel like there is a problem she doesn't just write me off . She takes the time to explore it and make me feel like it has been addressed . She always gives me as much information as possible . If I am not comfortable with something  she is willing to try another avenue . I feel like all in all she puts me first in my health care . 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he has always looked out for my well being. I never had any issues with him and I trust his medical advice based on prior experience.
0.400000	Doctors are after the bottom line for the most part, which that is how many patients can I see in a day and how much money can I make off them. My doctor is sort of that way and I don't like having to wait hours for just 5 minutes of his time. It takes longer than that to diagnose someone and help them through that situation
0.600000	I have a lack of trust with physicians when they seem to be completely distant from me when I am giving them information or explaining my situation. It boils down to them having a lack of social skills - I often feel like when I am being shooed out of an office to get me out as soon as possible, it feels as though I am not worth their time. Again, this often happens when I am at an urgent care clinic or with doctors that I am seeing for the very first time. Also, a lack of professionalism shows me that they could potentially be wrong about a prescription. 
0.760000	I lived next to my primary physician for a few years and we always got along very well, having that personal relationship was one of the reasons we chose him, and him being a younger person knowing he would be around for awhile also helped.
0.680000	I have been going to him for years. He has always given me good advice. I trust him completely to make good recommendations.
0.840000	He seems to know what he is doing and knows the technical terminology when we discuss my problems. He seems to have empathy as well.
0.560000	I don't have a primary care physician, but I've seen several doctors during the last year.  Two of them prescribed treatment which I agreed to.  One doctor did not tell until after the treatment that I would need to have surgery to have the problem corrected completely.  I would say most doctors can be trusted, but some cannot.
0.760000	I trust my doctor for a few reasons. First off, they are a doctor for a reason, they want to help people improve their health. Also, there are plenty of laws and reasons for them to not slack off and do a bad job, so they are well incentivized to be accurate.
0.400000	I don't trust my primary care physician because she is barely available and doesn't spend much time with me. She doesn't fully listen to what I have to say. Her assistants do most of the intake, if not all of it. She often seems stressed, and she probably is. Even so, I need someone to sit down and listen to me for more than three minutes. Every meeting and exam seems to only cover the bare minimum of a patient's needs.
0.800000	I trust her because she genuinely seems likes she wants to help and she has the knowledge to do so.  She is very kind but stern, and does talk about a lot of options I may have.  She also is quick to refer me if she knows I would be better suited with a specialist.  My only distrust would be that she is fairly young, so she does not have the experience of the more established physicians.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he takes a lot time with every patient to figure out how you are and what is going on.  Willing to give all the tests needed to figure out any issues.
0.560000	There have been times when my Dr. has overlooked things, but there have also been times when my Dr. has been very thorough. 
0.800000	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician, because I have been a patient of his for a long time. He is a fairly young doctor and is intelligent and knows about new technology and medications. I have always been able to get same day appointments, if needed. He has never steered me wrong on the topic of health or taking care of myself.
0.560000	They get in to mush of a hurry, it feels rushed. They will come in and start discussing what needs to be done and while I'm there I feel like I don't even talk the same language sometimes. I almost always look everything I can remember on line. It helps me figure out what is really going on. 
0.760000	I feel like my doctor listens to me and will do everything they can to find out what is going on with my health when I need them to. They have always listened to me. 
0.960000	My doctor is very well educated and experienced. He is warm and approachable and always tells me the plus and minuses regarding medicines and treatments I need.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she has always listened to my concerns and taken time with me,  instead of rushing through my appointments.
0.640000	For the most part I trust my doctor to monitor my health and if a problem presents help me find a reasonable solution. But I also people in human mistake and that sometimes you have to be your own health advocate.  Doctors don't always have the right answers and sometimes you have to be persistent if you feel something is not right. 
0.400000	I have had bad experiences with doctors and have been misdiagnosed. I have unfortunately had doctors with God complexes who believed they were right and would not listen to me as their patient and it turned out I was right all along.
0.640000	I feel like no matter what Dr. I go to, no matter what the reviews are lie they are always just about the money. it really sucks and I feel really awkward. I always feel like the doctors dont care about there patients. I have yet to find one that actually cares.
0.560000	I trust them to a certain extent, but I know they are influenced by Big Pharma, and are reluctant to tell you about natural, effective treatment, and will probably try to get you on some type of prescription that you may or may not need.  In many cases these drugs can do more harm than good.
0.640000	I trust the doctor because he is experienced and deals with patients with similar problems. Since he is familiar in his field he will know how to treat me. 
1.000000	I havve been with my GP for 20 years. I can trust anything he says. He has been with me through the good and bad times and always tried to do whats best
0.760000	When it boils down, a doctor is still a human and all humans are prone to error.  I believe they are obviously more educated on health subject matter than me, but I don't necessarily put 100% trust that they know best all of the time. 
0.840000	I trust doctors because ultimately, I visit them because I'm not an expert in regards to health and medicine and because they have the means to help me. They're the ones with the expert knowledge. If I do think that they're doing something questionable, I would consult yet another doctor. Furthermore, doctors tend to be high on empathy and people who study this career did it because they wanted to, no one forced them to do it. I think this makes them more trustworthy.
0.760000	I will go to the doctor if something is wrong and so far have never been sent wrong or given wrong advice or information
0.960000	My primary care physician is a young man who takes his time talking with me and actually listens to what I have to say. He then asks relevant questions and discusses which course of action would be best for me and which he feels would best address my concerns. He is always available through his patient portal and responds in a timely manner. His staff is also very kind and caring and I get a sense that they actually quite enjoy working for him, which to me is very telling.
0.800000	I do not trust all doctors completely. They are human and can make mistakes, and may not always have all of the answers, and may not know the entire situation. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she has an excellent track record. She has consistently provided excellent care and treatment for myself and my family. She has proven her abilities over the long-term.
0.440000	I feel Doctor's no longer spend time engaging with their patients. It's in and out. I feel most of what's said is ignored and simply one problem is quickly looked at and guessed with what the popular treatment is at the moment.
0.200000	Well I dont feel like he uses enough wholistic techniques only knows medication. He isnt thorough enough. I feel like he looks at physical appearance and then does basic tests.
0.800000	I have been with my same doctor for years. During this time, from my impression, my doctor has always been honest and forthright with me. My doctor's actions and behavior has never given me any reason to distrust him. Therefore, until I am given a reason, I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
0.680000	I have never had any experience to make me not trust my doctor. Most of the time I think he is trying to do what is best to treat whatever is the wrong in the most effective way.
0.480000	I dont completely trust my medical physician because often I feel like instead of doing what's the right thing for me they are likely doing what can get them paid the most. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I think they are very thorough. I feel like they go through all the necessary questions to diagnose me and prescribe the right medications to help me feel better.
0.800000	I feel like my doctor went through a lot of education and training to get to where he is now, so I feel like he probably has a pretty good understanding of my health and how to treat and maintain it
0.680000	I trust my physician because I did a lot of research and got some recommendations from people I trust. I made the best choice for my needs and situation. My physicians has my best interest at heart. 
0.240000	all doctors care about one thing, money. they don't care about you. to them, you are a bank and they want to drain you, even if you die.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel like the doctor does not listen and treats every case or condition the same. If they have seen something like it before, or have experienced something similar before, they tend to forget that every person is an individual and may react differently to the same condition as someone else
0.840000	My primary care physician is thoughtful and absolutely does his best to give good advice.  At the end of the day, though, medical decisions are my decision, and  I need to do my own thinking and research about serious conditions.
0.720000	My physician has always been very helpful in getting me any information I need, even when I am asking a lot of questions. 
0.480000	I find most doctors I have dealt with to be very rushed. If I explain something poorly, they get the wrong idea and prescribe the wrong treatment. They don't have enough time to do good diagnosis. So I think the doctors are good people. I also think they don't have enough time to do their jobs well. Likely, they may not be as up-to-date as they need to be with medical science.
0.800000	I have been lucky to have always had doctors that I have complete trust in. They have always been thorough in evaluating my symptoms or issues and have taken the time to sit down and have a conversation about my options. They have always been open to questions and I have never feel rushed or felt they were putting their convenience over my well-being.
0.760000	I trust my doctor to am extent. I know he has my best interests at heart. But no doctor can keep up on all the newest medical research. So I try to supplement with my own research
0.960000	My PCP takes time with me and asks me lots of questions.  She looks me in the eye and treats me as a person who is intelligent and capable of understanding health information and decisions.  
0.840000	I do not go to my PCP often because they are far away but when I do go I do trust their option because they have not seared me wrong yet. It is important to be able to trust your doctor. 
0.760000	My doctor is caring and understands I like natural remedies and cures, but will make sure I am aware of all of my options in any condition and suggests what she feels is the best route for me. We have developed a relationship of trust and genuine care for each other. She always makes extra time for me during my appointments because she knows I like to talk and I feel that relationship helps foster trust so she doesn't rush me to a remedy to get me out of her office but cares about my well-being.
0.440000	Doctors in my life have shown an air of superiority when I have been discussing issues. To the point that I have to argue why I don't want a certain treatment or medication. They can act with blinders and not even recognize it.  
0.880000	While I have been lucky to have great doctors whom I trust, and I trust my current doctors, I would say that I do not necessarily trust doctors in general. This is because I understand that doctors are less likely to take women's reported symptoms seriously, medications that may be prescribed are tested much less thoroughly on women than on men, and especially in obstetrics women are not given important information to monitor their own health during/after childbirth which leads to the US having an incredibly high maternal death rate for a first-world country. If I were a man, I would trust medical practices a great deal more. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I feel he has no reason to deceive me. I give them good money to be told the truth and guided in the right direction regarding my health.
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing her since I am a child and she always will go the distance to figure out what is wrong with me when it is something more than just a cold. She will order multiple test and blood labs, and always tries to explain all information with me. I am comfortable in talking with her openly and she does the best she can to keep me at ease.
0.880000	"I trust my primary physician because to say the least he is a realist. He keeps things honest and it's not just about saying what he feel's is required to be said, he gives me relatable examples and tells me personally things about his life and hose around him as well and it gives me a much more relaxing feeling and the ability to trust his word. He doesn't always come with the ""Dr. Talk"" that people whom are not in that field doesn't understand. he gives me advice medically and personally."
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is extremely careful and honest telling me about all the different treatment options all the time.
0.560000	It's hard to keep cynical thoughts out of my mind. I can't help but see them as flawed and just figuring things out like everyone else. It's hard to know if I'm communicating clearly enough for them to totally understand everything anyway.
0.800000	My Primary care physician works with a team. I feel confident that he can handle any medical situation I might have, he also consults with the team if necessary.
0.560000	I think that the amount of patients doctors are forced to see to be paid reasonably means they spend small periods of time with large numbers of patients. I am sure that given more time with each patient, along with adequate time to review medical tests and records, more nuances of medical conditions may be noticeable and it would be easier for doctors to prep for each appt with adequate resource material to provide the patient.
0.720000	I have had terrible medical experiences for the last twenty years and I finally have a great Dr who will spend hours with me if necessary and appears to actually care how I am doing. 
1.000000	It is a rare quality these days since I have seen at least 15 different family doctors throughout my life, and the family doctor I have now actually listens, he hugs me when I walk in, he looks for any side effects for my current medications if he has to put me on something temporarily, e.g. antibiotic, and he spends quality time with me. Even after months of telling him something, he remembers it like we just chatted about it moments ago. His memory, attention to detail, and time with the patient is extraordinary!
1.000000	My family has been going to the same physician for over 50 years, starting with my grandfather. Our doctor has been reliable and up front for all that time. I have no reason not to trust his judgement.
0.600000	I feel doctors do not generally look at all options and want to do what is best for their schedule, not what is best for the patients needs
0.800000	My primary care physician takes the time to go through what has gone on since the last time I've seen them.  They go through all of my medications.  They do an exam and go over any and all symptoms I may be having. They thoroughly discuss any labwork that was completed and then discuss all options for changes.  I trust their opinion because they take time with me. 
0.880000	Good references from other people concerning his technical ability, thoroughness, genuine interest in patients.  He's also embedded in a system with lots of other support services, and uses them thoughtfully.
1.000000	Physicians have generally given me plenty of information and different options for care. They explain things when asked. I have rarely encountered physicians that are not attentive to my needs as a patient.
1.000000	I've been to doctors in the past that I've questioned some of their decisions, but I'm very happy with the current doctor I see.  She is knowledgeable, well-educated and respects me as a patient.  She listens to my concerns and responds in an appropriate way.
0.760000	I have a good rapport with my personal physician. I feel this way because she not only takes the time to thoroughly discuss my health, but she also spends time with me discussing issues that are not always directly or indirectly for that matter, related to my health.
0.680000	For the most part, my Primary Care Physician actually listens to what I'm saying. Because I do experience anxiety, I've had previous doctors that brushed my symptoms aside as simply anxiety and not an actual problem. My PCP isn't like that for the most part. She has questioned if it was my anxiety but believed me when I told her I could tell the difference and that it wasn't. What I don't like about her is the way that she treats the med students. She literally told one in the room with me to not ask so many questions. That made me nervous because that's how people get killed is by not asking questions.
0.800000	I guess I could say that I trust my primary doctor because he hasn't given me a reason not to trust him.  He is upfront, tells me about options, explains procedures, and is good natured.  I believe he is looking out for my best interests and until he does otherwise, I will have trust in him.
0.200000	I do not believe that doctors know much about a lot of problems that have not been discovered and wrongly diagnose people very often with something based on very little research or facts. I also believe they are sales men for pharma company more then they are doctors who want to help people.
0.640000	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mine, but sometimes I do not agree with their treatment ideas. I had a doctor make me get an endoscopy for abdominal pain. It was quite an invasive test that was useless as it did not show the cause of my abdominal pain. I went to another doctor who ordered a non invasive abdominal ultrasound which showed gallstones. I had to suffer and take it upon myself to get the care I needed.
0.720000	I don't have a primary care physician, but in general, doctors are open about a patient's health. Even when they are stern, it is because they want the patient to have the best outcome. There are few doctors who would deliberately mislead a patient. 
0.720000	One of the main reasons I trust my doctor is that he actually listens to me unlike some doctors.  He takes what I say in to consideration and knows that I am familiar with my body and that I usually am on par with what he is thinking.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he always gives me all my options in detail and never tries to mislead me. Sometimes though he does seem to push options that are more convenient for him and the practice. 
0.440000	I feel that doctors often are overbooked and take the easy way out.  Itâs got to be a nightmare dealing with insurance companies.  Many just treat every patient the same.
0.960000	I have only had two primary care physicians in my 30 years of life. I am very particular and will only stick with a physician I feel I can completely trust. My current doctor is very open minded and has never once shut down any of my concerns. He has never made me feel rushed in an exam room. He gives his patients his cell and home phone numbers in case we need anything. He is always there and available. He is extremely supportive of my choices and the way I want my healthcare to go, but isn't afraid to tell me I'm making the wrong choices and offer better ideas when needed.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he takes the time to listen to me. I never feel rushed and have to confidence to speak my mind. He also seems to care about how I am doing overall, not just medically. 
0.600000	I don't feel that my doctor actually takes the time to always understand what I am experiencing.  I feel that he thinks that since I meet the general criteria then I am in a category that I am not necessarily in.  My first experience with him I was a little overweight and had high blood pressure.  He said that if I don't loose weight by my next visit we need to discuss weight loss surgery.  Crazy.
0.600000	I feel like my doctor seems me as a number and not as a patient. He never allows me to fully discuss all of my issues and just rushes me out. He comes off cold and i do not have trust in him but will be looking for a new doctor.
0.480000	I don't feel like they take the time to get to know me. And what I would want or offer me all options or ask questions. 
0.280000	doctors and staff are motivated by pharma, insurance, and liability.  They are also overworked, often seeing several patients at once.  That puts my best interests at the bottom of the barrel.  I have had bad luck with doctors through most of my life-- bad advice, dismissive of my symptoms, etc.  I don't dislike my current doctor, but don't fully trust her either.  
0.480000	It is not so much that I distrust doctors. I just do not blindly trust them. I take what they have to say and go from there. I may have a differing opinion on what the best option is going forward. I also may agree with what they have to say and we are both on the same page. I think I ere on the side of caution. 
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor completely because she sort of rushes the appointment.  She doesn't really do whats best for me because she should be testing my thyroid on a regular basis.
0.760000	I think all in all doctors are worthy to put your trust in their care. I just think there aren't enough doctors to go around. They are so frazzled and tired trying to keep up.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him my entire adolescent and young adult life. I have fallen ill beyond a point where I could recover without assistance from a medical professional and when I went to my doctor for consultation, I felt like I was in knowledgable and caring hands. Furthermore, my parents have faith and put trust in my doctor and I know my parents want what is best for me and my own health, that is why I would trust my primary care physician even more. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he is always willing to take the time to answer questions I have about medications and treatment plans and he works with me to make sure I get the medications that my insurance will cover and he checks to see if there is one that they cover more of the cost. He also explains why he makes medical decisions, like prescribing medications or doing certain tests for me before he does it to make sure I understand completely what the reasons for doing it are and the benefits and risks of it.
0.560000	I think my doctor is very likely to want to prescribe a medication too early without looking deep enough into my condition. I think my doctor could gather more symptoms in order to make a more informed decision. 
0.800000	I have a great doctor who is very understanding and takes time to dig deeper. My previous primary care doctor just wrote me prescriptions and sent me on my way without listening, which is how I went undiagnosed with a thyroid problem. Having a doctor who listened and took the time to figure things out why fighting my insurance makes me trust her a great deal. 
0.560000	I think it all comes down to certain situations on how much you get out of your doctor, if it's right before they're leaving they're going to rush and just say what's convenient even if it's not 100% accurate. If they've had a good weekend and i'm the first person than there's a good chance i'm going to receive everything I should get on any time.
0.800000	I have been lucky in life.  I have not ever had any serious medical issues.  So maybe my faith in medicine hasn't really been tested yet.  But I tend to trust my doctor to give me the best care that she knows how.  I know that science and medicine are always coming up with new ideas, so not everyone can know everything.  all I as is the best care you know to provide. 
0.840000	Well my doctor has been seeing me for a while now so he has understanding where i am health wise. I trust his judgement due to his experience and so far its been good.
0.720000	I don't think my doctor takes enough time with me, or patients in general, to really know what is best. I think that my doctor relies on drugs too quickly and too often as the solution to the problem.
0.560000	Doctors are people who can make mistakes. My issue is less that I distrust my primary care physician, but more that I do not trust him/her completely. No professional should be trusted completely, and patients need to have basic critical thinking skills when seeing a doctor. 
0.600000	I do not put complete trust in anyone but myself. I would like to believe them but odds are I will get a second opinion or verify what they told me myself.
0.960000	"I trust my physician because she is always very personable with me. She always gives me both the ups and downs to new medications and doesn't push me to take anything that ""she wouldn't take"". "
0.800000	My wife and some other family members have the same doctor as I do. All of us have good things to say about my doctor. She does a good job each time I go to see her at an appointment. The reason I didn't put strongly agree is because all doctors are't 100% perfect and that some of the decisions regarding medication are mine. There are a few prescriptions I am on that I am not the biggest fan of. 
0.760000	Most doctors care about their patients. Unfortunately, the system is set up so they probably cannot spend as much time with each patient as they would like. I think they do the best they can given the circumstances but I also believe in taking responsibility for my own health. I take everything with a grain of salt and often wonder if health professionals are not telling me everything for their own financial gain (i.e. pharma companies supplying incentives for pushing certain medications/treatments).
0.560000	"i have a difficult time in general trusting only one person with something serious, so i don't have ""complete"" trust in the doctors i see. i value their opinions and typically do what they think is best unless there's a good reason not to, but i wouldn't call it complete trust"
0.440000	I believe doctors often do not want to admit when they do not know something so they will bs and beat around the bush. This leads me to not trust them and be skeptical of future advice.
0.440000	I have migraines. My former pain management doctor gave me botox injections. I also got occipital nerve blocks for a different headache. My new doctor (moved to a new state) told me nobody is trained to do that. He didn't offer any type of option. He doesn't care. I don't trust him with my care for that reason.
0.720000	I generally trust doctors in general. However, they get caught in a huge bureaucracy and regulations and fear of law suits when it comes to healthcare in general, it limits their options.
0.920000	He will actually open up studies and show me where the information is coming from. He does not beat around the bushes. He gives me pros and cons for everything when it comes to symptoms or medications
0.640000	I do not know my primary care doctor that well. I see him 1-2 times per year. He is very smart and knows what he is talking about, but that's not how I build trust with people.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he is a professional. He always treats me with care and respect. I never feel like I'm getting bogus or insufficient information. He's also pretty good at remembering things I've told him in the past--personally, I mean. 
0.560000	It is not that I distrust them. I know that they have many patients, and that their attention cannot be 100 percent on me. It is my own responsibility to make sure that I am doing everything I can to keep myself healthy. They have a lot of patients, but I only have me.
0.560000	I trust doctors who take the time to get to know me and my situation, but all too often doctores don't take the time to see you as a person and do not custom,ize their advice to fit your particular circumstance.
0.760000	Generally, I tend to trust my doctors' treat and their recommendations.  Since I have not been in severe health condition in the past, I didn't think seriously about doctors' advice because I mostly respect their treatment and recommendation.  I think most doctors should be reliable and trustworthy in giving best treatment and recommendation for their patients.
0.600000	I generally trust my doctor, but I feel like I see them only occasionally and not for that long, so although I trust their diagnoses and treatment recommendations, I also think I would seek out further information about it so that I could consider how much I think it is good.
0.840000	I guess I have only had one issue that involved a pap smear test going to the wrong lab and me being charged way too much (like $10 vs $500). Considering that was just human error, I have no real reason to distrust my doctor. But mistakes can happen, so I don't fully trust anything. 
0.840000	He has always been open and honest about everything and fully explains what is going on or what he is doing.  He will give me all my options and let me make a decision or give his opinion as to what is best but still let me decide. 
0.440000	I've only seen this doctor twice in the past couple of years.  Once for my general physical and he was very careful and checked out when I needed my next tests, etc. I have now not had any blood test for over 2 years, and he just keeps refilling my Rx.  I went in for a skin problem and saw him for 1 minute after waiting 2 hours - I was upset of course.
0.440000	I believe my doctor is fallible, just like any other humans. All doctors have difficult and stressful jobs, and will sometimes take the easy route of simply prescribing unnecessary medications with both short-term and long-term side effects instead of providing other options.
0.760000	The reason I trust or distrust doctors is because I believe they have a protocol to follow. They might order an xray when it could of been more beneficial to order an MRI. I understand they also have to perform what is approved if the patient has limited insurance.  
0.440000	He doesn't even remember my name or say hello to me if I walk by in the halls.  Like he's emotionally detached from everything and is just there to do his job, nothing more.  I can't trust someone who share little care for their patients.
0.280000	I don't trust doctors in general because they are not there to truly help you but rather to sell you medicine and procedures which simply hide the problem and not fully address it which ultimately results in the worsening of my health. 
0.560000	as a person that knows a fair amount about medicine and practices i know that at times there are doctors that look out for themselves or the drug companies over your well being
0.800000	I have been going to my PCP for over 20 years now exactly for the reasons above. He takes his time with me, asks questions, and is honest about how he feels. That's why I still go to him.
0.840000	I have always had no issues or concerns with my doctor and believe that they have my best interest in mind and are honest with me.
0.560000	It always seems that doctors are rushed. I don't think that they always have patients best interest in mind. Paying more attention to the bottom line than well being of patients. 
0.840000	I don't believe a poor doctor would remain in business for very long.  I regularly check reviews on doctors before I use them.
0.560000	I distrust my doctor because they have to google the answers to my questions when I come in to see them with questions. I currently have Medi-Cal and the selection of doctors that accept Medi-Cal are limited. After I finish school and have health insurance, I would definitely do research to switch my primary care physician to someone I trust more. The doctors at the office have a cosmetic focus as well as primary care, so when I had asked for a referral to see a dermatologist, I was not given one. Though the doctor did not push me to get cosmetic treatment, I feel like referrals to dermatologists would hurt their business.
0.760000	I don't have any reason not to trust my doctor. I will continue to trust her until she does something to earn my distrust. I would apply the same standard to any doctor.
0.760000	I've been seeing this PCP for the majority of my life so i trust her judgement on most medical decisions. Sometimes i feel as if though she has a lot on her plate and can't spend more than a few moments reviewing certain pieces of information about my medical history, but overall she touches base on all of my medical concerns. 
0.680000	A couple of times she had misdiagnose my illness. I went to a specialist after talking to my Primary care practician
0.800000	I generally am in good health, but that's partly due to having some knowledge of nutrition as well as a working understanding of well-being. Accordingly, I can tell when a doctor is bullshitting me but I find that they generally don't.
0.800000	our doctor is well known in my community and he is our family doctor. my mom trust him, so i trust him too. but talking to other doctors, i test them first by asking a lot of questions before i can trust them
0.280000	I have pcos and I feel like the doctor is always trying to give me false hope with something new that I haven't tried that will help me have another baby. Sometimes I feel like they look at me as a money person who will pay. 
0.520000	I trust doctors mainly because I don't really have a reason not to. I have never been mislead by a doctor or have received any bad medical advice in the past. 
0.960000	My doctor is open and willing to have conversation about my concerns. She listens and then refers me for further study or specialist if she is not certain of the status or route to take.
0.320000	I recently started with a new primary doctor and I don't trust her.  She has not been very helpful and just wants to send me off to other specialists.  She's not really helping me.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he's been with me for quite a while and he's never brushed off any of my concerns.  While he talks to me like I'm a friend, when he needs to be, he's serious and blunt and makes sure that I understand what's going to happen.  The one time I needed surgery, his recommendation was wonderful.  He regularly checked up on me and made sure I was recovering nicely which definitely made me feel more like a friend rather than just a patient.  Considering that and the way he thoroughly explains things to me, I have complete trust in him.
1.000000	My primary care Doctor is great. She spends a lot of time with me and monitors my health very closely! She is really caring and gets really excited if I eat healthy and drop weight and get my BP down and my cholestral down. She is a nice person and if she is late she will apologise when she comes in unlike most Doctors!
0.920000	He is trained to do his job and to do it well. He took an oath and doctors are supposed to keep up with the latest research and developments in health care. If he makes a mistake he risks his job and reputation not to mention his ability to practice medicine. I have no reason to doubt he would do everything he can to help me as my doctor.
0.720000	My doctor wants what is best for me and will prescribe the best course of action. He has a lot of experience doing what he does, so I trust his decision and authority over anything that I might think.
0.800000	Because if they lie to me they would be in big trouble. Doctors should always be truthful to their patients at all times no matter what.
0.840000	I have no reason not to trust my primary care physician.  She has always been straight forward with me.  She listens, investigates the problems, provides a solution, and if the solution is not working, then we work together to find another solution.  I wouldn't say i have complete faith in her, but i trust her and her ability very much.
0.520000	"I think that doctors do care about their patients, but I think that the degree of sympathy strongly correlates to what time you show up in their day. I have found that many doctors don't like to seem wrong, so they will always go to the quickest solution first, and don't tend to really even consider other conditions unless you pry them with questions about relevant symptoms. My problem is mostly with treatment options. Doctors offices are often sponsored by various name brand drugs and that often sways the decision on which drugs to give as treatment. I also don't agree with the trend to do different screening procedures for different insurance plans. It seems that the better your insurance is, the more expensive and more prevalent the testing that is ""required"" becomes. "
0.720000	I think my doctor has my best interests at heart, even if she is very busy.  She always has a lot of patients but she has shown genuine care for me.  She takes the time to give me all the options for treatment and explains them.
0.640000	I feel neutral about them because sometimes I feel like they are just telling me the most common solution to my problem instead of thinking outside the box.  Sometimes I feel like they make excuses so they don't have to really think in depth about what could be wrong with me.  
0.200000	The doctors office i go to is always so busy. I normally have to wait a very long time for appointment. Then when the doctor sees me now it does not last for more than 20 minutes. They are always telling me to leave and that there is nothing I can do.
0.720000	I've known him forever and he's pretty kind.  We have a generally good relationship we've maintained throughout the years and he helped me get back on track with managing a condition I had neglected due to a doctor that made me feel poorly about myself.
0.440000	I think it is probably inefficient for a doctor to be thorough, especially if the best course of action for me might be unconventional. 
1.000000	My doctor is an excellent communicator, a good listener and expresses his opinions with confidence.  He is well-trained, experienced and view him as a trusted friend. I trust him and confide in him.
0.600000	I think that overall I trust my doctor, but will verify for myself if there is anything that she says that I am suspicious of.
0.800000	Had my doc for ten years now.  In a small town with limited healthcare I was nervous, but first time I met the guy, I knew he was ok. Has all the latest do dads to measure the blood pressure and all.  Always knows whats best.
0.640000	I trust that most doctors have the patient's best interest in mind. I don't have a general distrust for doctors, but I also don't blindly accept their opinion. I always research.
0.360000	I never completely trust anyone.  I think that all doctors are purely in it for the money first and patient well being a distant second.  
0.720000	My doctor has been a family friend for years and is aware of my needs. My doctor treats me like a member of family and makes sure that someone has the information I need before I leave in case I forget what needs to be done at a later date or later on in the day. 
1.000000	My doctor is very open and honest. She just not speak down to me or just give me orders. She communicates with me in a dialogue, listening to my concerns and opinions. She shows real interest, offers advice, and listens. She does not lecture but works with me as a teammate to take care of my health.
0.800000	He seems to know what he is talking about and explains things quite well, so i trust what he tells me.  So far I have no reason not to.
0.920000	Though I think my doctor may make some choices that are easier for him, I know he is a well respected and good doctor. He is published many times so I generally trust what he has to say and am confident in his choices and actions.
1.000000	My primary care physician really listens to what I say. She remembers things about me from appointment to appointment. I really feel she wants me to be healthy and happy. 
0.880000	My primary physician has always taken good care of me. There has never been a moment where I even questioned him because he does his job diligently. I always leave his presence feeling better whether its because I've got medicine or a greater state of mind about my current situation. He has never given me a chance to doubt his capabilities. 
0.680000	Many doctors seem to rush through appointments and take the easy solutions when a more thorough visit might be appropriate along with discussion of all treatment options.
0.560000	I don't currently have a PCP, but have had two children in under 2 years, so I am answering in regard to my OB/GYN. Unfortunately, the Banner office I go to does not allow me to see my regular doctor all of the time and forces you to rotate through doctors. There are 3 that I really like and trust and the rest I do not know so well. Also, during my latest labor (Sept 2017), the doctor told me we needed to use the vacuum because my son's heart rate was dipping. I pushed him out on the next try, after she had already attached he vacuum. Even though it wasn't used to extract him, he now has a calcified bump on his head from the vacuum suction. I do not feel like I was given other choices in the moment. 
0.280000	The reasons why I do not trust my primary care physician is that I have the impression that they mostly care about safeguarding their liability instead of being concerned about the patient's medical needs
0.800000	I have been seeing my doctor for 15 years. He sends me to specialist when my care is outside of his realm of primary care and so far he has sent me to doctors that have been pretty good with my specialties. There was a time that I did not have insurance and my doctor did his best to do what he could that would help without insurance.
0.800000	We have a family doctor that I started going to at an early age and now this doctor sees my daughter. Myself and my family members have been seeing this doctor for many of years. There has been a lot of trust built between us We do believe he has our best interests in mind..
0.760000	My primary care doctor is a psychiatrist, and she does a good job of talking about both medical and non-medical treatments. She's good about explaining side effects and talking about realistic outcomes of treatment, and she knows it's important for me to feel like I'm not being pushed into making decisions.
0.520000	I suffered from migraines for years, my doctors always said to just stay away from my triggers. They never worked with me to reduce or relieve them. 
0.760000	My PCP is open and I believe honest. She also takes time to listen carefully to me, and I believe she respects my input. I feel we work together as a team, and her words and actions reinforce my belief.
0.800000	When I go see my primary physician it seem that he is always looking out for me . When I ask question he effectively answers them and provides many solutions to the problem I go in for.  
0.800000	She addresses all my questions in a thoughtful and caring manor. She never seems like she's trying to rush me out of the exam room. Also, I've been seeing her for a few years and have never had a bad interaction or diagnosis that was wrong.
0.480000	In general, I trust my doctor. Sometimes I get disappointed. That happens when I cannot get an appointment when I need it, I do not get phone calls from doctor's office informing me about a problem when I have to wait for a refill of medications.
0.560000	I generally think that doctors are good people who go into medicine to try to help people. I also believe that like any profession, there are nuances that average people do not understand or care to, and I can not completely trust an individual who has personal incentive to provide you care that is not necessarily ideal for you. As long as pharmaceuticals are as big of an industry as they are I cannot completely trust doctors. 
1.000000	I have a really good relationship with my primary care physician.  I've been seeing the same primary care physician for over 7 years now.  He's helped me through issues that I knew I had (anxiety/depression) and also issues I didn't know I had (possible melanoma).  I have gotten to know some about his background as well, and given what I know, I trust him implicitly. 
0.800000	I just had my doctor leave the practice I go to and I've started seeing a new PA.  She is very nice, but we are still getting to know each other and figure out communication.  My PA was very nice and straight forward the last night I met with her and listens to my questions.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel like doctors thinks they know more about what I'm feeling than I do. It sometimes makes it difficult for them to take me seriously and leads to them downplaying my symptoms or ignoring some of them and telling me it's nothing or I'm worrying too much.
0.680000	For the most part I can trust my primary care physician, but I also like to do my own research just to be on the safe side. I trust him because he has helped me when I was sick in the past. 
0.720000	It is her job and she has the training necessary to give me proper information; she also seems to really care about her job rather than just going through the motions and takes time to think about questions I have rather than answering off the cuff, which seems to mean that she is giving some real thought.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician sometimes. This is because I have been seeing him for awhile and he has prescribed me my birth control, iron pills for having low white blood cell counts, and has given me different types of medicine for my anxienty. The only thing is that I have complained about both axienty medicine pills making me extremely sleepy and my doctor has not done anything about it. I took it upon myself to stop taking the pills because I hated being sleepy all day long. Doctors should also not be giving patients all of these opioids and other pills like xanax where people can get extremely addicted. That is why I do not trust doctors.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician. I believe that he cares about his patients and gets them the help they need. He is competent and if he can't help with a specific problem he can recommend a doctor that can.
0.440000	It is my opinion that a lot of doctors are just out for the money and they want to rush you out and get the next patient in.  I do not think all doctors are like that but I do think that when someone is looking for a blocked or to choose they should really make sure they feel comfortable that they're getting treated properly.   Also if you have something majorly wrong with you I believe that a second or even a 3rd opinion is a good idea.   I believe it's called a practice because no doctors perfect and every doctor it continuously learning.  When experience I recently had is I was sent to the emergency room with a stomach related problem the doctors was full and I got sent to the heart floor for an overnight visit.   They gave me an EKG even though I was not there for my heart in charge me anyways even though I disputed it.   I am they're young and have a very healthy heart there was no reason for that.
0.640000	I some times dont trust doctors as they have become commercial now a days and sometimes they are selfish about their own growth financially irrespective of the patient's health. sometimes i do trust my doctor's decision but sometimes m doubtfull but dunno why but no doctor is more careful about my medical needs than his own.
0.840000	I trust my primary care doctor because they seem fairly personable.  They care about me as a person, and I have known them for almost 20 years. 
0.800000	I have gone to the same physician for all of my adult life now; my mom is his nurse, so I'm always able to get in and out quickly, and believe that he strives to offer me the best care possible.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she takes her time in explaining things to me and giving me advice. She is NEVER in a rush, even though there are probably other patients waiting for her. She never hesitates to tell me to call her or her office -- or through the patient portal -- with any questions or concerns that I might have. 
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done anything which has lost my trust. There have been several instances where he knew is capabilities and referred me to a different doctor who have the knowledge and skill necessary to help me in my time of need. When I visit with him his head isn't in a pad or notebook so I do not feel like I am just another checklist in his big book of clients. He is very personal and takes the time to actually talk to me and get to know my family which is nice. I have also been going to him for some time so I have built a good report with him.
0.720000	once again i know how to trust the doctors because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about how to talk to my doctor and stuff.
0.400000	I generally feel mistrustful because I don't think doctors really care that much about people, since they see so many patients and have so little time to spend with each of them. I also don't trust that they know what is best for me half the time, since I know my situation and body better than I can communicate with them or they have time to learn about. I also feel suspicious that they are being paid off, for example, by drug companies to push for certain medications , regardless of the patient. 
0.440000	My primary care physician is not very thorough. He also doesn't take my concerns that serious. It also seems as though he is always rushed when I go in for an appointment. 
0.400000	I suppose there are numerous reasons why I don't trust doctors, but the biggest reason for me is that I feel most get into the profession because they want to make a lot of money. The concern for them isn't treating sickness out of the good of their heart, they simply desire to make a lot of money, even if they sacrifice their time/well being for it. It's about them being well off, not me. For me, this is an icky feeling and I have trouble getting over it. I have met doctors whom I have come to trust, but that takes time and they have to prove exceptional to get over that greed-hurdle I've imposed on them.
0.880000	For me, the default is to trust doctors, and my PCP has given me no reason to distrust him. In addition, he has always been sympathetic and responsive to any problems I bring up. He also does some community events. I believe he cares about and values all of his patients, including me.
0.600000	I feel that doctors are very educated and trained individuals who opinions should be taken into consideration. For serious medical conditions, I believe in obtaining second opinions. I am in general weary of taking prescribed medication.
0.840000	My doctor has treated me well. My only complaint is that he is sometimes in a rush and I can sense he doesn't have more than a few minutes to speak with me.
0.760000	My PCP has always been very kind, thoughtful, and educated. I have never felt like an idiot while being in the office with her. 
0.320000	I just moved to a new city and have only met with one doctor. She doesn't have the personality to work with me. I'm very educated about my disease and she pretty much brushed me off instead of working with me. I wish doctors would listen to their patients instead of putting them on a 5 minute time clock. 
0.240000	I distrust my because we would rather save money and resources. rather than try and help my illness and or bodily dysfunction.
0.600000	Doctors are highly educated but may not have all the information regarding every disease, particularly chronic illnesses and it is always better to do your own research as long as it is done properly and well.
1.000000	My primary care physician has only ever shown me they are thorough.  They do not make me feel rushed and always provide a satisfactory answer and checkup before they move on.
0.720000	I think i trust the physicians to do their job to the best of their ability. Sometimes, i think that there are areas that are too specialized and then i seek out more information. 
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician for the most part because he treats my whole family, but I personally don't get along with his personality that much. I feel like he jokes around and doesn't get to the point fast enough. I trust that he knows of A way to treat something, but he feels very confined in his treatments and doesn't feel comfortable exploring other options outside his comfort zone.
0.400000	I distrust my doctor because of medical advice that he gave me, that turned out to be completely false. This makes me have little trust in doctors in general.
0.680000	I believe physicians or primary care go to school to have the up most education in understanding another human. Sometimes you know your self too much to want to hear what a physician has to say. But its always great to hear the physician out because that its there job to do so. They are there to help the public and anyone in need.
0.600000	My primary care physician tends to present options to me and suggest one of the options based on what he knows about me, such as waiting to have surgery performed for something that is not life threatening but may cause more issues in the future than what it does now. He also listens to my concerns and addresses them in an understanding way.
0.880000	In my family we have the habit of always seeing the same doctor and socializing with him, because of that, the trust we have for him and, apart from that, he has proven to be a reliable person over the years.
0.720000	I usually trust doctors to provide the best care possible for me or my family.  As long as frequent checkups and follow-ups occur, doctors can closely monitor a patient's health and provide the appropriate treatments for any conditions they may have.  As long as a doctor keeps a good relationship with me and makes me feel comfortable I trust in them to have good intentions for my health.
0.640000	I do not have a primary care physician as I rarely need a doctor and if I do, it is for something specialized (kidneys). In general cases, I trust doctors and believe they give me credible, appropriate information but I'm not willing to completely believe everything.
0.640000	In general, I trust what she tells me.  However, she is a general practitioner and I've learned that when I consult with specialists I often get more options and more information.  Therefore, I don't always think what my GP tells me is all I need to know.
0.760000	In general, I will trust what my doctor has to say 90% of the time, and may do more research on my own about their suggested treatments. They have the experience to know the different treatments, surely more than I know doing research. If I ever feel like my doctor doesn't really have my best interest in heart, I will get a second opinion.  The more I've seen one doctor in particular, the more likely I am in trusting what they have to say to me. 
0.720000	Sometimes I feel that my physician has a lot going on and not a lot of attention going toward me. I understand that they are overworked but I do feel that I will need to take charge of my own health if I feel that they do not completely understand me. I will take what they say strongly into consideration but if it does not seem to fit me, I believe that I know myself better than they do.
0.720000	I trust them because they have taken some health issues (depression, anxiety) more seriously than other doctors I have seen. I sometimes feel rushed though, so I am unsure if I always receive the complete truth or all my options. Overall I feel I have a good relationship with them and accept their opinions. 
0.840000	Generally, I feel they have little reason to be dishonest or disingenuous, compared to the large incentive they have to be truthful and helpful.
0.800000	I was taught to trust doctors and those in authority.  Even though I may have questions regarding what they are prescribing or telling me what to do, I still do have some skepticism.  Doctors often work with pharmaceutical companies and I wonder if the drugs they suggest are actually good for me or good for their profession and their bottom line (AKA money).  
0.640000	It's not more of a trust or distrust, it is more of a time thing. I feel like doctors, including my own, need to be able to spend more than 3-5 minutes with a patient. Yes, I know I have a cough and sneezing, so my asthma is acting up. Don't just throw a new inhaler on me. Give me some options and other things I can do at home. I want to know the options I have for medications too. So I feel that adds a little mistrust, but I still feel like he is a good physician. I hope that makes sense. 
0.800000	I think that most doctors try their best to give me the best treatment and offer good advice on what i need to do or what needs to be done.
0.680000	"I had an experience where I thought all possible testing was done on an annual basis, and that I had requested and approved.  I later found that that was not the case and I was positive for something that they don't test for ""unless you have symptoms"", even though it was consistently marked as something I wanted to be tested for annually.  Since then I have had no issues, but that was a serious misstep in communication."
0.600000	I have more trust in doctors than I distrust them but there are always exceptions. Mostly it comes down to the situation because there are times when I can tell that they are hard pressed for time due to having a lot of patients. If it is a serious medical issue I would also want a second or third opinion regardless of the trust I have in my doctor.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she has always listened to my issues and questions.  She always gets back to me with an answer if I happen to email or call her.  I have always felt safe and well taken care of and I never worry about her not getting back to me.  She really cares about me and my well-being and it shows in her interactions with me.
0.680000	I feel doctors are trustworthy in the fact that too many people are sue happy. So if the doctor does something that people can sue and get easy money they will. So in my opinion doctors need to be careful and be trusting all at the same time
0.320000	He would rather talk about himself and laugh at his jokes than pay attention to my needs.  I can get whatever prescription I would like, just by asking. He doesn't remember from one visit to the next anything about me.  When he is not laughing and not paying attention, he has his nose in that stupid computer of it.   
0.480000	I do not completely trust my doctor because it seems as though he really doesn't care anymore. He is close to retiring and just seems as though he wants to get in and get out of the room as quickly as possible. 
0.720000	My physician is very nice and relaxed, he's open to talk and laugh. He is very thorough, even to the point that he wants to schedule so many tests that I'm the one who says no. My only problem is there is only limited time with him, instead there are 4 other assistants or nurses who come before and after him for different purposes and they all come and go quickly
0.560000	I distrust all the doctors because I do not see that they try to help, they just thinking how to sell expensive medicine or expensive treatment. They offered my son a new medicine for treating his allergy for $100 out of pocket, this medicine is extremely new and doesn't tested enough, knowing that allergy problems start from the gut I can't except the doctor who sell skin creme and doesn't think about the gut. This doctor drives Tesla is that possible, no. That is why I am extremely careful I try not to argue but can't accept to work who are thinking about their profit instead of helping patients
0.840000	I trust my primary care doctor very much. I have only had need to see her twice, but she was a good listener and very thorough both times. I can contrast this with doctors past with whom I had trouble getting my needs addressed. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for years. She is a very caring and understanding physician. She listens to your needs and helps you find a solution to your problems that makes you comfortable. She doesnât make you feel pressured nor incompetent when you donât understand the health terminology. She breaks things down so you can understand and she makes sure she available if you have any questions or concerns. My physician takes pride in what she does and itâs transmitted through her having our best interest at heart.
0.840000	I believe my doctor is talented and capable.  I place a large amount of faith in my doctor and I feel that it is rewarded often. 
0.760000	I tend to trust my PCP because my family and I have been with him for a long time. Negative experiences with new, specialized doctors have recently led me to doubt/question all doctors.
0.840000	I trust my physician because they always ask whether I am doing okay or whether a certain medication is working for me. They want to make sure that I am in good health every time that I go to the doctors office for a visit. 
0.440000	I distrust doctors. I have vertigo that is bothering me a lot, so I went to my primary care doctor who did not help me much other than giving me pills to see if they were effective. It was not effective at all. Therefore, He referred me to another specialist doctor in ears, throat and nose. That doctor did not do anything to help me other than trying to deceive me into buying one of the non-prescription medicines which I could get at a lower price at a local Walgreen. I feel so hopeless. All I wanted was to heal my vertigo. I still have it now, but I don't trust any doctors anymore.
0.840000	I have complete trust in my doctor because I have been his patient since I was 19 years old.This doctor has delivered all 3 of my kids and I know if I tell him something that conversation stays between him and myself. He's very professional and he cares about his patients.
0.800000	he is very knowledgeable and always provides different options and talks about possible side effects and is a great listener,not in a rush to get to the next patient.
0.600000	The short reason why I will not blindly trust a doctor is that they aren't infallible, and I've been on the receiving end of a bad doctors misdiagnoses and paid the price for it. So yah, not gonna trust anything blindly. 
0.520000	"I don't completely distrust my primary care physician as much as I think he just doesn't care.  He seems pretty apathetic and uninterested in what's going on with me.  I don't think he realizes that I do take my health seriously most of the time and so I am going to do things that most people won't do to take charge of my health.  Where most people want a magic pill, I am willing to make changes in my lifestyle.  I don't think my doctor necessarily cares.  He just wants to prescribe a pill because it's the quickest easiest way to ""fix"" the problem."
0.440000	I'm not sure I trust him because he's a psychiatrists I've been seeing for 5 years.  I'm going downhill and he doens't seem concerned.  he's told me to look on the internet for advice that he should be giving.
0.320000	The last time I want to my doctor he seemed rushed and had other things to do do. He said he was going to do a tetnas shot that day. He never marked it in his notes so the nurse never gave it. 
0.440000	He is more interested in turnover than quality care. He wants to get you in and out. He presumed you're an idiot.
0.520000	"I feel that they always say ""no, that symptom is not because of _____"" or just send me away with some blow-off treatment for my symptom. I am very aware of changes in my body and sensitive to them. He might know medicine way better than I do, but I know my body way better than he does. "
0.880000	My doctor is a great doctor, but she has so many patients (1800) that it is just hard to trust her 100%. She is a doctor at a VA hospital and they are always so busy that they may sometimes overlook or not notice something. 
1.000000	I trust doctors to help patients make the decisions. I believe that most doctors care about the well being of their patients. I believe that very few doctors are in the profession for themselves. 
0.840000	My doctor takes her time, appears to listen, and seems compassionate. She provides her advise and encourages me to consider additional options that could help me be healthier. 
0.800000	My doctor is amazing.  When I have had a medical condition, everything was done to get me to the correct specialists to make sure it was taken care of.  My doctor even called me after the appointments to follow up.
0.600000	Most of my more recent physicians have told me about treatments that they preferred, and completely neglected to tell me about other types of treatments that would be better, cheaper, and used newer techniques. They were an older doctor, and worked for a free clinic so I suspect they weren't keeping up with newer techniques (in their defense, they do come out at a blistering pace) and instead defaulted to an older, less effective series of treatments. This has happened a fair amount to me, and has led me to doing my own research and getting a second opinion.
0.800000	My primary care physician is the only physician that I've had so far that hasn't made me feel bad about my body or my health decisions. She works with me to come up with the best plan and answers any questions I have about my treatment. 
0.800000	She has been truthful the whole time I have been seeing her. I don't see her being untruthful now. She is a great person who is concerned about my well being.
0.440000	For me personally, I spent several years with an diagnosed problem, despite how often I was going to see my doctor about the problem.  Being that this problem was causing incredible pain, I am a bit distrustful of both my doctor and doctors in general.  I do not blame my doctor for missing it, but I do blame them for not even suggesting that my problem could have even been the cause.
0.800000	I trust him because of the history i have with him, between having a baby and him understanding my health goals, it helps to have someone who knows your body and the required things it needs to feel better or well.
0.520000	I distrust my primary care physician because I have family members who works at hospitals and I can see that the doctor only cares about how many patients they can see and donât care to find out the background of a personâs daily life and see what is affecting the person and trying to solve the problem slowly. They would rather prescribe instant medication to stop the problem from spreading but does nothing to get rid of the problem or be proactive about the problem next time. We basically have to solve our own problems then go to doctors to get the drugs. 
1.000000	Because she is always open and honest with me. She doesnât sugar coat anything for me. And that is exactly the way I like it. She takes her time with me. She never acts like she s in a hurry or look at her watch and clock all the time.
0.840000	Well they are there to help you, no reason to lie or trick people unless they have a horrible agenda under their belt to hurt some one. but I trust them very much because they have helped me. Now I wont go to a doctor the doesn't seem to care how I feel or treat me with respect.
0.800000	I trust doctors because they have the training and education and I do not. They understand what is happening to body and know what the best treatment will be. 
0.600000	You should never trust anyone completely. That is just being lazy, and letting someone else do the thinking for you. You should always put some effort in to evaluating things that other people say/do, regardless of how much you trust them.
0.760000	My doctor has been working for many years. I trust his experience, but sometimes I doubt his knowledge of up to date medical procedures/medications/causes.
0.800000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor.  So far, she has always been thorough and helpful with any problem I am experiencing.
1.000000	I've been to a lot of other Dr's who seem to ignore the issues I'm having and just focus on my weight. My current Dr does not do that, although we are working on getting my weight down it's not her solo focus.
1.000000	Every time I have had a problem and my doctor has given me a solution, the solution has been beneficial to me personally and my health. I have been seeing my doctor for over five years now and have not yet had any experience that would lead me to believe anything different. He will tell me what I can do to improve myself more  such as losing weight or referring me to see a dermatologist if I am having skin problems. He will not tell me something about my health if he is not 100% certain and I appreciate that. 
0.840000	While I was in the Army, I had no trust in my medical professionals. Now that I am a civilian, my doctors seem to actively listen and care about solving any issues that arise. 
0.600000	I don't trust or not trust my doctor, I just feel like they always point my symptoms at something that it's not. And I also worked in a doctor's office, so it made me not trust doctors as much as I would like to.
0.640000	I believe that my doctor is honest and trustworthy, but with all of the resources out there on the internet to research your health symptoms, it is hard for me to put complete trust in my doctor. I have also heard so many stories of people being misdiagnosed and the results were almost catastrophic! I have always been told to trust my instincts if I think that something is not right. That makes me so nervous to just accept what doctors tell me. I also ask for extra testing or information to double, even triple check what my doctor is telling me.
0.640000	Overall i trust that doctors have my best interest but sometimes i don't think they take what i'm saying seriously and that could because they see so many patients that they don't have time to really hone into the problem
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because the few times I have been when I had a problem they were able to diagnose me correctly and do the right thing to get me better again.  
1.000000	I have learned to be very selective in choosing who I work with as a health care provider. If I find myself in a situation where I don't believe the provider is communicating on my level, or if they raise their voice or are clearly not concerned about my quality of life, I will cease to be their patient as soon as possible and find other practitioners. I also, have, on occasion, written letters of complaint to practitioners. The physician I currently am seeing is someone I've had a relationship with all my life, and from her way of communicating, I can see that she has good judgement.
0.480000	I don't have one primary care doctor, and the doctors at the Army hospital are more interested in keeping the patient flow moving than they are in effectively treating their patients, whom they will most likely never see again.
0.680000	Its important to me to have a good relationship and a strong degree of trust with a chosen physician.  I'm relying on the physician to take good care of me and use good judgment.  They do the best they can I'm sure.  The patient too, has an active role in the relationship so try to do my best as well.
0.920000	Same MD I've been seeing for 20 years, I feel she's very open & honest about everything.  She always offers a few different treatment options, and tells me why or why not she would recommend something.
0.480000	My primary care physician over prescribes, he's given me so many steroidal medications for simple viral infection, just because I have very mild asthma. He also gives antivirals, orders chest xrays even when I have no noise in my chest. It's too much and too often. He also isn't informed about mental health, I tried to ask for counseling and he couldn't find a list, then when he found it half the numbers on it were no longer in service or the providers didn't take my insurance.
0.640000	As explained before, my doctor doesn't always have the time or the commitment to explain every single little detail. Perhaps they feel it's unnecessary, and that I should trust their judgment. This is somewhat worrisome for me, as I do not know what potential issues might be going on even if the doctor does. This isn't really to degrade the work that they do, and how they treat me, since I don't believe it is done on purpose. Nevertheless, it reduces my confidence in my treatment, or any medication provided. 
0.560000	I take everything with a grain of salt. In most situations, I will follow the recommendations of my primary care physician as they typically know what is best, however I also do my own research. Occasionally, if I don't feel my questions have been answered satisfactorily then I will seek a second opinion. 
0.720000	I have a good amount of trust in my doctor- he seems to have my best interests at heart. He doesnât rush when he sees or examines me and takes copious notes that are added to my electronic file. He has his staff do follow- ups if he canât do them himself. 
0.880000	I have been seeing my primary doctor for seven years.  She is through, and takes the time to listen to all of my concerns.  Although I have many health conditions, they are all controlled by twenty prescriptions.  I feel my main concern is RLS, which I research at RLS.ORG.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because I have family members the use the same one and have had good experiences. He follows up on my health with phone calls and long conversations.
0.480000	I generally distrust doctors because they seem prone to prescribing drugs to put a Band-Aid on a problem rather than fix the problem itself.  I would be far more trusting if I found a doctor that was willing to help me fix the issue.
0.480000	I would like to say I trust doctors but I seldom see one.  I do have medical appointments but I seldom see a full-fledged doctor.  I dislike having my rare times in medical offices be with a nurse practitioner, etc.
0.600000	My doctor does not seem to give as much effort into examination of me.  They mainly just ask a few questions and then take a quick look.  I feel that therapists would be much more helpful.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have no reason not to and she is competent. Again, I have had only routine visits, nothing serious, so I don't have a lot to base it on.
0.560000	I sometimes get the impression from my doctor that they do want to do anything too risky, and often times medical conditions go untreated. For example, when getting colds, the doctor might just suggest that I wash my hands more frequently. That may be effective, but I could find that out by searching the internet, or even by thinking. I dislike paying medical bills for these types of consultations.
0.680000	I feel good about my primary care doctor because I've been seeing her for a while and she's helped me several times when sick or feeling depressed, etc. but I don't have the same good feelings about most doctors in general. 
0.880000	I feel like I get an adequate amount of feedback and explanation for their decision making to understand their thought process leading to the medical decision.
0.560000	I feel like sometimes my physician takes the extreme treatment option first, as in, wanting to do surgery immediately, versus taking a less invasive option first and seeing if it works. I often feel like my physician has one foot out the door because there are too many other patients waiting to be seen. I would rather weigh all of my options and start with the lest invasive option, and move further up the scale if it is needed.
0.680000	I feel that most doctors become doctors in order to do good and help people, however a few can let greed and selfishness get in the way of their original goals. I have been fortunate to have mostly positive interactions with my medical professionals throughout my life. 
0.760000	I actually recently switched physicians to a PA. The town doctor the PA works for I do not trust at all because he is an jerk but on my form I have the PA as my primary and I trust him completely. He is a friend of the family and has been working in my town for decades. He is dedicated to what he does and very kind. Prior to my recent switch I had a pediatrician who was wonderful growing up and always steered me and my parents in the right direction. I wish I could have stayed with him but unfortunately pediatricians obviously only work with kids.  
0.800000	They can get into a lot of trouble if they lie to someone. I also haven't been mislead by a doctor yet in my life. A lot of medical information is easily verifiable on the internet nowadays too, so if your doctor is lying to you it is easy to find out.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because I've known him for many years. It is more of a built up trust that we have.
0.920000	I have known my primary care physician for years. Every time I go there, I walk away positive and confident about my sickness and know that she will do what she can to help me get better. She is very thorough and has a lot of information to give and is patient with me. 
0.640000	I don't actually believe the doctor is actively trying to mislead, but are they getting an incentive to prescribe one drug over another????  and it is almost impossible to keep up on all the different medical studies.  How up to date are they???  are there other options they don't know about. 
0.840000	The practice of doctors is efficient.  They listen to my concerns, address them immediately, and strive to anticipate normal concerns and cover them.  They take an active interest in my overall health, not just in the complaint presented at appointments.  They are holistic in their care, and every doctor in the practice is comfortable with my chart and my needs.  They are all capable of helping and caring.
0.800000	It's just the feeling that I get. With doctors it is all about trust. If I didn't trust a doctor I would shop around until I found one that I did trust. And again it would just be the feeling I got off of them that decided.
0.600000	Most of my interactions with my primary care physician are straight forward. I mainly interact with him for general check ups so as long as nothing is wrong most of what I hear from him is that everything is good.
0.800000	My doctor is around the same age as me. She is very aware that weight loss is important but it's not as simple as just losing some pounds. She has never pushed any shots or drugs on me if I'm not interested.
0.480000	My husband is in the Air Force so I have to see the military doctor on base.  Sometimes I feel rushed when I come in for an appointment and don't really get my needs met.  Sometimes I have a couple of problems but them only want to talk about one and that can be frustrating because I can't keep taking time off work to come in for everything.  There have been a few times where I've come in for a problem, one time in particular for an ear ache, and the treatment my doctor prescribed didn't work at all.  Instead of just referring me to a specialist they made me come in for another visit.  In the end, I'm still dealing with this ear problem that comes and goes.
0.800000	I trust primary care physicians because in general, they have extensive training and tend to see many patients over the course of a short time span. They are typically knowledge and willing to refer me to specialist if a condition is out of their scope of expertise. I would not trust a primary care physician who is overworked or tired because I would think their judgement would be affected. 
0.840000	I feel my Dr. always listens to me and seems very caring. She always takes her time and is not in a hurry to get to the next patent. She explains everything more then once and always ask me if I have any questions and if I do when I get home to call or email her. 
0.200000	I distrust him because he just wants to hand out pills instead of getting to the root cause of the problem. He has been treating me for migraines for years and years and it turns out it wasn't even migraines. It was tension headaches. So he just wanted to switch me to a different medication instead of offering massage with the physical therapist (which is covered by the insurance).  I had to make a huge scene to get him to let me go to physical therapy over just trying to medicate the pain away. He's so focused on getting through his appointments in his allotted 15 minute slots that it keeps him from giving an honest look into the best solution for each patient individually. Some patients may be perfectly content with popping pills, but I'm not. He should have said here are the options available, which do you prefer?  But that doesn't happen with this doctor at all. 
0.640000	I have some trust in my primary care doctor, but don't have 100% faith in him when dealing with other than really basic care issues. On the other hand, he is more than happy to refer his patients to specialists. It is almost like he is aware of his own limitations.
0.560000	I believe they do a good job, are a decent person and a good doctor. However I would still never put my trust completely fully in them, not without them earning my full trust in some way.
0.560000	I don't know where the doctor is coming from or what motivates the doctor. I am young so the doctor would probably overlook serious issues and may misdiagnose me
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a medical doctor. He once brought a medical condition to me that I had ignored for a long time and he persistently asked me if I had certain issues that I was in denial of. He recommended getting some blood work done and I am so glad I did because it turned out I was actually pretty sick on the inside. Once I started a treatment for this medical condition I improved so much. I trust him for reasons like this. 
0.800000	I have used the same PCP for  the last 5 years. In that time ihave got to trust his decisions on my health care.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they have gone to school for a very long time to study medicine. I feel they would not have been given a license if they were not competent enough to provide medical services. I believe most doctors generally want to help people. Even though some doctors are just in their field to make a lot of money. I trust my doctors if they have been practicing for a very long time because this would mean that they have experience. I also go by my gut feelings or intuition about people's character and trustworthiness in general.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I believe in their expertise, years of training, and experience in the field. I do not consider myself a medical expert so believe it is in my best interest to defer recommendations to a professional who can offer informed guidance. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because of the relationship I have built over the years. Also my doctor has a stable client base and they have never misdiagnosed or prescribed anything I would refer to as unecessary.
0.400000	My Doctor is first off human and fallible. Second, he has repeatedly failed to listen to me and my symptoms when I have described conditions, only to discover that I indeed had the condition which I claimed. He also has a tendency to talk over me and has no real regard for my health, only placating my symptoms and referring me to specialists.
0.880000	Same doctor for 7 years so good rapport. Doctor keeps up on the latest studies and medications for my health concerns
0.640000	He usually explains the situation to me, asks my opinion when choosing a treatment. This way, he earned my trust
0.520000	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust regular doctors in general. Honestly, it depends on the person. If I have a gut instinct that the doctor doesn't really care then I will not trust them and if my gut tells me that the doctor is compassionate and really cares about the job I will trust them. 
0.680000	I do not hesitate to ask questions and make sure they know what i want and what i expect. i do my homework so i am familiar with my options ahead of time. i make sure i let them know what options i am interest in and give them the opportunity to discuss those options with me.
0.440000	physicians tend to look out for themselves and only provide medical advice/prescriptions based on what pharmaceutical company is paying them the most. They are overworked and don't spend enough time with their patients. 
0.920000	My doctor is very knowledgeable and helpful. She explains everything that i need to know about my lab work and my exams. I feel that I can talk to her and she listens.
0.800000	She is straight forward with me and lets me know about the options that I have. She doesn't sugar coat things and doesn't pressure me in to decisions that are unnecessary. I feel that she actually cares about my health. 
0.800000	Doctors are highly trained professionals. They know what the best course of action for your conditions are better than you do. I think you should just trust and be honest with them if they have not given you a reason to do otherwise.
0.560000	I do trust my physician with my medical treatment. I do feel as if he rushes me through my appointments and doesn't necessarily treat my issues with the severity I feel they may be. I have found that any issues with mental health are taken more seriously though.
0.800000	She spends an ample amount of time with me during my visits and makes sure to answer all of my questions. She also goes over every part of my visit and blood work in detail. She also follows up with any questions over the phone. 
0.720000	I haven't been with my primary care doctor for very long, so while I don't have a reason to distrust him, I haven't built up enough of a strong relationship yet.
0.720000	I just switched my primary care doc after over 20 years so I really don't know her all that well.  It isn't that I don't trust her; she's just new to me.  Being a nurse, I do have doctors that I work with that I trust and will ask their opinion on something from time to time.
0.800000	I mainly trust him because he is a smart person who is detail oriented and when he explains something to me it makes sense to me. I have had doctors who tried to shoot me a line of bull to manipulate me which may seem good to them but if it does not make sense I can't believe anything they say.
0.720000	I have a good endocrinologist that I trust with medical issues; however, when it comes to diet recommendations he does not have accurate info.  I listen to my body and know that I must eat a ketogenic diet which my doctor does not agree with.
0.480000	he is under a lot of pressure to see a lot of patients. he is always in a hurry and the medical record he refers to doesn't always seem complete for me, like what was covered in the last appointment. 
0.800000	My PCP was recommended to me and I felt comfortable around her from the first time we met.  We have similar views about certain issues and that leads me to believe that she will definitely have my best interest in mind.
0.800000	I trust him because in the years that I have gone to him he doesn't seem to push anything on me as far as medication and most times gives me a practical way to work with illnesses I might have.
0.840000	My primary care person is an advanced practice nurse practitioner. She has demonstrated a high level of active care for me, and is extremely thorough in her work when examining me. She is an exceptional listener, and has even detected health issues of which I was not aware. She communicates very well, and takes all the time I need to address my health concerns.
0.520000	I dont feel like I trust my primary care physician because she seems to force me to take shots that I dont really need and forces unnecessary tests onto me just to make a few couple bucks. But she seems knowledgeable and thats the only reason i am sticking with her for now.
0.600000	I HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A DISTRUST IN DOCTORS.  HAVING CARED FOR AGING PARENTS AND A DAUGHTER WITH HEALTH ISSUES I FOUND MANY TIMES DOCTORS WERE NOT THOROUGH ENOUGH AND AT TIMES I FELT WERE GUESSING AT BEST.  DOCTORS ARE NOW TECHNICIANS AND NO LONGER HEALERS.
1.000000	I trust my PCP because he is thoughtful and caring. He always asks about my health and if I have questions. He remembers my name and information we have discussed during prior appointments. He is thorough with examinations. He takes his time.
1.000000	primary care physicians are there to help us, people may have different outlooks on treatment but none of them have a medical degree to back up there beliefs. We have doctors for a reason, they are trying to help us get well. Even a physical can make an error in treatment, I recently has a visit do the dermatologist and he prescribed me medication that did not help.There was no reason of me to be concerned, I called him back and got a different drug that helped. The amount of knowledge and understanding of science that the MD have is incredible. I'm very grateful for there service. Trusting your physician is important part of anybodies life, they will not harm you or judge you , they are there to help.
0.480000	My PCP is part of a group.  They need to see as many patients as possible.  They rarely have time to deliver quality health care and be able to think through all options.
0.800000	I have never been given a reason to not trust my doctor and he always seems to take precautions even when he believes everything is ok.  This makes me feel better because he is not just going off of book knowledge and things he's seen in other cases.
0.800000	 do not currently have a PC. in general i trust doctors because they are more knowledgeable than i am. this does not mean i do not see the value in second opinions, however, i recognize these are trained professionals who have a better understanding of any health issue i might have.
0.960000	Because he is a good guy and I have known him a while now.  He often tells it like it is and doesnt sugarcoat things, but he is always honest.  He has often told me things that other doctors would tell me one way and he would say that was just a waste of money and it was.
0.720000	I think my primary care physician is really good at his job and I trust his recommendation most of the time.
0.240000	because she tells me nothing. she invites other doctors in that also say things like it doesn't look good but when you ask them what it is they say i can't tell you here is a referral to another doctor who then says the same things and prescribes drugs without an explanation at all of what it is and what its for
0.360000	I am in control of my health and I like to do research on what the doctor is saying rather than blindly trusting them. 
0.800000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Over the years she has been correct many times, when it comes to my health. She has given me the best healthcare service. She has tried to improve my health time after time.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician cause they always lay it down straight forward in front of me about my conditions and the treatment options I have.
0.840000	My pcp is thorough and listens to my opinions about my medical issues. She frequently informs me of my options and lets me decide what I think is best for myself, since I know more about my problems than her.
0.200000	I don't have a primary care. In the past all they have done is make my problem worse, not better. American medicine for the most part is just another way to make money.
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I truly think they are looking out for me. I have friends who are nurses and they have all told me they've never seen anything to have them question a physician's judgement.
0.960000	My current primary care physician is incredibly thorough in her evaluation of my health issues and in her explanation of the options available. Whenever she makes a recommendation she goes into a lot of detail about her logic behind the recommendation and explains why others might have a different opinion. I usually do some research after my appointments with all physicians in order to make sure that I understand all aspects of my illness or treatment and have never found the information my current doctor gives me to be lacking in any way.
0.760000	For the most part I trust his knowledge.  I think the problem lies in our approaches to medical conditions. I am more interested in natural drug free options.  He may not always agree but he will allow me to make my own decisions.  
0.560000	My last primary care was a DO not an MD, and would not treat menopause as a medical condition.  I had to request a referral to an OB/GYN to treat my menopause symptoms.
0.800000	I am lucky to live in an area where I have access to qualified medical care. My medical conditions are complex; I need to be able to trust my doctors. If I have any doubt, I move on. Otherwise, I am just wasting my time and theirs.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they're very helpful. They always answer any questions I may have, no matter how silly they might seem
0.760000	"Doctors are generally good, but they only work with what you give them.  They make mistakes as well.  They ""practice"" medicine.  I know my body best, and many times have successfully diagnosed my own problems.  Doctors go on evidence and when they don't find any, they can sometimes dismiss you.  But I feel deep down, we as patients know when something is not right within us.  "
0.520000	My physician is condescending. Usually when I have questions they're met with a 'duh' attitude or as if it's something I don't need to know. I struggle with making regular visits because I end up feeling angry and marginalized. 
0.640000	I trust the medical expertise of the doctor. I do not, however, trust that they are doing the right thing all the time. My doctor's office, like others, is clearly there for insurance money, making us get lots of tests.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to examine and talk to me.  My physician cares to know me as a person and takes a lot of time to ask me questions and gives me time to ask questions to make sure I understand everything.  
0.560000	Once you reach 60 and all the doctors are 30, you lose a lot of trust.  Then many doctors are treating statistically, instead of treating personally.  I take what I can get.  It could be a lot better.
0.640000	My primary physician has been a physician in my family for a long time. I completely trust that the reason he has been was because my family trusts him. 
0.760000	I have one medical condition that is rare and doctors have no effective treatment. They generally pretend to have some awareness of the condition and offer me treatment I know if not effective.  Once in a while I will get a doctor who is honest and their lack of expertise with my disease.
0.720000	I generally trust most doctors, while I don't have a primary care physician if I ever need professional medical help or advice I usually just go to the urgent care center and they have always been able to help me with my problems. So my trust level for them is average I would say, I don't necessarily believe everything a doctor says, but I also don't think everything is a lie they are telling me either. 
0.800000	I trust most doctors simply on the fact that I know nothing about it and they are train and educated to know about it. Also, some doctors just seem more genuine in the bedside manner than others.
1.000000	I have been going to him for years. He listens to what I say and tries to help me. If I am having a problem he will send me for test to see if anything is wrong. he sent me to have an echo cardiogram when someone said I had a heart mur mur. 
0.800000	I trust my physician because I have checked his credentials before I have signed up with him. Also I have learned to trust him even more because my brother who is a doctor too in another country agrees to everything that my primary doctor says.
0.520000	I don't trust the American healthcare system in general, not necessarily the doctor. Nowadays, patients are just numbers to doctors. The medical care system is deeply flawed and needs reform. People aren't being treated properly for their illnesses because of astronomically high medical costs. Everything is about profit, so that's why I don't trust any doctors.
0.840000	My primary care doctor goes over all of my options and I have asked about options that she has not presented and she will explain why she thinks that option would not fit my lifestyle.  She also genuinely listens to my concerns and answers my questions.  
0.880000	He is courteous and attentive. He is very informative and talks about every option available to me in regards to my health. I always feel as if he is treating me like I am his only patient, as he devotes all his time and attention to me in that moment.
0.800000	I have been going to him for a long time.  He listens to me and knows me and my history.  He values my input, as he says no one knows my body better than me.  When I had some financial problems, he understood and started with the most conservative course of action, while still giving me good care.
0.440000	I have been misdiagnosed with mental illnesses twice. He is quick to prescribe medication and get me out of the office and on my way. One of the medications I took had negative side effects and he was unconcerned. It seemed he just recommended it for the commission cash. That medication has since been recalled. Both the doctor and his medical assistant rush through questions during check-ups. I feel like I'm inconveniencing everyone by being there.
0.680000	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice that they are aware of. I do not think of doctors as gods or in fallible, because of which I do not trust them without question. I also do my own research and seek second opinions when I feel I should. I do know that my doctors want to give the best care they can provide, that just might not be the actual best care availible
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for such a long time now that I trust them. They have never done me wrong and always help me out when I have a problem. 
0.600000	I feel like most Dr's are good and want to serve their patients in the best manner possible. However, there are some that are self serving and will recommend care for what is convienent or will generate the most monetary reward.
0.800000	I facebook stalked my current doctor. I was in search of a black female doctor who was not overly religious to be my primary physician. I truly trust her and know that she has my best interests in mind because she is like me. I don't get the same feeling of controlled condescension that other doctors have and none of the fanaticism some black women are wont to have. It 's just pleasant, and I feel like big pharma cant buy her either. 
0.800000	The took an oath that I respect.  They would have no reason to not have my best interests in mind.  I do have an obligation to myself to double check their recommendations.
0.400000	I use a Patient First and although they are my primary care, I do not have one physician that I see.  I often see a Physician's Assistant or a different doctor every time.  It is hard to trust this situation.
0.600000	I feel like my doctor takes the time to talk to me and truly understand what I need. If he didnt, I would switch doctors
0.640000	I have never been in one place long enough to establish a primary care physician. I think it depends on how connected I feel to them, if I feel rushed and that they don't care then I am less willing to talk to them honestly or feel confidence in their opinion.
0.720000	I feel like my doctor is very capable and knows what he is doing.  However, I think he tries to schedule too many patients in one day, leaving very little time to tend to each patient.  Each time I go in, I feel like he hasn't even read my chart and I have to explain my situation to him each time like I am a new patient.
0.360000	I have had some recent negative experiences with my doctor perscribing certain medications that have extreme negative side effects and my assumption as to why this medication was prescribed to me was because of the comission the doctor receives from the pharmaceutical company.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I know of their certifications and background. I have known them for a long time as well with no issues. Every time they helped me their advice has worked well.
0.600000	I mostly trust but I also know that doctors do not know everything and they make mistakes too. I also have heard many stories of people having doctors who push their own agendas or make decisions based on what is easiest and safest for them and I worry about that happening to me. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor, because she is very thourough, and very careful. She is ver concervative in prescribing any and all medications. Sometimes I wish she wasn't so concervative, but I'm grateful she is. Most Drs. just throw medication at you, she does not. She looks for other alternatives first, if that doesn't work, they she'll try meds, but very concervatively.
0.680000	I know my doctor knows more about me than I know about myself health wise. Some things I really dont feel comfortable speaking about with anyone. This is usually the case with the doctor, as I do trust what he/she will tell me but comfort isnt always there. Sometimes I get angry with my doctor as well when I hear things I dont want to hear. Especially when telling me to change certain habits I have had for years. I do also use the internet to self diagnose myself and certain sicknesses I get. Sometimes its really just a tossup on if I want to ask or not about something. 
0.880000	I've been seeing my primary care physicians for over 5 years now.  He has never failed me in letting me know what my problems are.  I completely trust him when it comes to my health.
0.560000	I mostly trust my primary care physician. However, there have been a few times where I go to this person over something and the doctor gave me bad/unhelpful advice.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician. He always address my problems. At times I feel I have to remind him of something and than he agree to look at the problem.But always addresses my issues and look further to be sure things are OK&gt;
0.680000	The nurse practitioners have started to slowly replace primary physicians. I have had negative experiences being touched inappropriately by a physicians. I distrust their motives.
0.560000	Just started going somewhere new and haven't really been that impressed.  They seem to rush through and don't explain things in as much detail as i would prefer. 
0.800000	She seems to have my best care in mind. Also she has taken care of all my questions with care.  Andshe consults with the other professionals in her network. So she has earned my trust and I hope to continue in her care.
0.360000	He has made mistakes and has misdiagnosed both my wife and I. He can be very arrogant and moody too. At times, he can be downright dismissive. He got fired from MedExpress. At other times he is helpful and more thorough thinking outside of the box to find the source of an ailment.
0.800000	I trust my doctor for the most part because he has never given me any reason not to. Everytime i do go to my doctor, he usually is very helpful in figuring out whats wrong and solving it. He also never tries to get me to take any medications  that will have bad side effects, and is really compromising in all aspects. 
0.600000	I mostly trust doctors, but complete trust has to be built up over time.  And doctors are people too and make mistakes.  I believe they try to do their best, but sometimes they are working with limited information - I don't always remember to tell them everything.
0.440000	She acts as if she cares more about her world than mine. Sometimes she seems closed which discourages me in wanting to contact her about my issues 
0.840000	Doctors train for a huge part of their life. They are incredibly knowledgeable and determined to provide the best care for their patients. I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
0.880000	I've thankfully had good experiences with doctors. I don't need to see doctors often, but when I do I have received care that I had been satisfied with. I feel that the doctors I have seen care about me, they care about making sure I understand my issues and they explain to me the importance of my options and the results of any decisions I make. I have not felt at all that doctors don't care for me or that I am wasting their time.
1.000000	"My new doctor is quite friendly in every interaction I've had with them be it in person, over the phone, or through online messaging. He makes eye contact and generally has a smile on his face. You can just ""feel"" that he genuinely cares about his job and helping his patients. He actively listens to everything I have to say, and I get the impression he hears my hesitation or what I don't say just as much as my words. I don't just feel like a patient with him, but a member of a team. We work together to come up with the best plan of action in treating my health needs."
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because he has helped me find treatment for things when I have gone to me and given me advise on how to treat things in a helpful way.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because I am able to discuss about my health and receive appropriate care.  My doctor appointments have been good and I am able to understand and learn about my health during my check-ups.  I am able to ask questions regarding my physical and mental health and receive a professional answer from my doctor.  I trust my doctor and the services being offered at clinics, health centers, and hospitals.  During my visits to clinics, health centers, and hospitals, I was cared for, treated, and given appropriate care from staff.  I love the work that nurses and doctors do and will continue to check-up on my health.  
0.800000	my primary doctor has been working with me for a few years and he is one of the best doctors i've ever had.  he is soft spoken, tells the truth but in a polite way, is an excellent listener, and has a pleasant attitude.  i have no reason not to distrust him; he hasn't lead me in the wrong direction yet.
0.520000	I feel that I have complained about the same symptoms for several years and only recently has the dr started to listen to my valid complaints. I understand that people have a magnitude of problems, but getting answers is very important
0.800000	I have a personal connection with my doctor. It is just something that occurs, chemistry, that I feel about some people. Once that connection is made it is just easy to trust what he is telling me. I can think of no reason why he would tell me things that weren't true and would not be in my interest.
0.760000	My doctor has only ever been helpful and kind when I've visited her. So far, her recommendations have been positive and yielded good results.
0.680000	I often feel like the doctors are overworked and they have to rush between patients, so they only spend a few minutes with you. This isn't really enough time to be thorough and careful despite how good their intentions might be. I don't have a problem with communicating to the nurses, but I sometimes wonder if all of the information is actually being conveyed to the doctor or not.
0.240000	In the past when I have had medical issues, my current primary care physician has brushed me off and not listened to my concerns. Through my own research and self advocacy, I was able to get the resources I needed, but definitely not with much assistance from my own physician. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physicians to do what they believe is best and affordable for me given the knowledge they have. That said, one can not be an expert in every specialty and sub-specialty so I do expect to be referred to a specialist if necessary.
0.880000	I trust my Primary care doctor because he respects me and the knowledge I have about my health and body. I have some different health issues and he lets me somewhat control my treatment. He listens well to what I tell him about my body and asks thoughtful questions. He helps me plan my treatment, and defers to my preferences. He's not a pushover, but he is aware that I'm the one living in my body, so i know my body best of anyone. And i really appreciate that!
1.000000	I have certain things in common with my primary care physician. He routinely vacations in an area I am familiar with. My doctor speaks English, and there are no cultural barriers between us. He has a good sense of humor and is, generally speaking, a very nice man. I like him as a person, and I trust his judgment. 
0.400000	i often have to seek a second opinion because i don't think my doctor really understands my problem. she is good for easy things, like a flu shot or antibiotics prescription, but i would not trust her to correctly diagnose and treat a more complicated issue.  
1.000000	I have been with my current primary care physician for over a decade now. We have developed an excellent rapport. I have no doubt that when I come to him with an issue, that he will be thorough and thoughtful.
0.600000	I trust them as much a I distrust them. I  am not a paranoid person but I would like to understand what medical procedures are being done on me and what the effects will be.
0.480000	I have change doctors in the last 6 months and am just starting to get to know them and what what type of caring person and how they work with me and the staff they have in the office. I do know they the few time I have been in the office I was not to draw in to this doctor, but mt dealing with the staff has been great they call back within a good time frame and have been very helpful with what I may need at that time
0.480000	The physician i see most often is my pain clinic nurse practitioner. I see two different guys and they contradict each other at least once every two months. It is hard for me to trust what either of them say because neither seems to be interested in healing my problem, only covering up or masking the problem. We have reached a wall and the only other option that could be recommended would be surgery but one physician feels I am too young and not in enough pain. Nothing either of them have done has worked to help my pain so it is hard for me to feel confident in any of their suggestions.
0.560000	My doctor himself is trustworthy, however, as he works for a for-profit hospital I know sometimes his decisions are based on money and he has to follow certain rules based on how his bosses see to make money. In order to have complete trust in him he would need to work for a non-profit
0.720000	the doctor profession is a divine profession, I have great respect towards them, they know our body situation better so I trust the doctors verymuch
0.520000	I just can't trust doctors any more.  I think they are like mechanics and just trying to upsell me on every little thing that they do.  Every stupid appointment is two hundred bucks.  just stupid
0.760000	"I see no reason why my pcp would not be honest with me.  I go to a practice where I am seen by residents and interns overseen by attending physicians.  There are plenty of ""checks and balances"" in place to ensure I am getting quality care."
0.560000	I feel that the business side of things makes it really hard for doctor and care give to give the best service as possible. I think they are push to see you longer then they need to and add on service that you really don't need. I think that they are good people but I think that management get to involved in health care.
1.000000	I trust my PCP because I have been going to see her for a long time and I know she values me as an individual.
0.800000	My doctor is very personable, friendly, and honest.   She does thorough tests yearly, gives me all the details and takes a much time as needed.
0.680000	My primary care physician has led me astray before, and a substitute doctor almost killed me. I had issues with my gall bladder and my doctor did not catch the signs of that happening, even though I was making appointments for a knee issue. Also, my knee issue was misdiagnosed as well. She did do a good job telling me all the treatments available for my knee issue, and she did diagnose the arthritis in my foot accurately.
0.800000	I think my dr takes the time to listen to me and give me good feed back when needed.  He is also good at referring me to the correct ppl.
0.680000	Overall I feel that doctors are honest and trustworthy. For the most part I believe that doctors want to help their patients and will do what is best.
0.720000	I haven't had that much medically wrong with me through my life. I had my tonsils and adnoids taken out, we thought I had a hernia when I was in junior high and one bout of skin cancer a few years ago but other than that, it's pretty much been colds, flus and bee stings. I've never had a problem with a doctor. I've never had a doctor lie to me, or at least, I've never found out about it. I generally trust people and that holds true for doctors as well. 
0.800000	I believe my primary care physician is trustworthy.  He came up as a PA from the previous doctor that was there at the practice and the retired doctor was very much a people person.  The current doctor has learned a lot from him but is now more of people person as well.  I trust him because he will follow up with questions and answers to treatment options.
0.400000	At this current time in my life I do not have a primary care doctor so I would be discussing doctors in general as a whole. I feel the training they received from medical schools is geared towards treating symptoms and prescribing medications and not curing the issue. This would be due to Pharmaceutical industry having such a firm holm on lobbying the medical education system. Doctors need funding and will do what is needed or asked in order to get said funding. It is a business and that means the end user/patient is not always going to be the focus of concern.
0.640000	She is personable and competent, but like most doctors, she prefers treatment over prevention. She is not always interested in the root cause of something.
0.960000	My primary care physician makes decisions where we both have input in and both discuss what is best for me; he doesn't make a decision for me, we both work together. 
1.000000	"My doctor has spent time during my visits to listen to everything I say. He listens to me like a therapist. He will even call me from his cell phone after business hours to discuss test results as he gets them. He's always been very thorough in explaining medical conditions and terms and treatments. He always ""fixes"" me quickly."
0.840000	I feel like my doctor would never lead me in the wrong direction when it comes to making decisions just based off past experience. Sometimes I don't always agree with his decisions and he knows that but we always do what we both think is best for me.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he genuinely shows concern for my health. He explains all of my options along with short and long term effects. He is attentive to my concerns and offer effective plans  and he is there when i need him
0.680000	I trust my doctor.He has always come through for me.He has never steeredme wrong. He has always helped me with my health and known the right things to do.
0.560000	I trust and do not trust my doctor. I believe that they will do their best to help me. Although, I also think that they might add in unneeded tests just so that they can get more money.
0.400000	I have had the same issues for years the the Doctors never can find anything wrong.  It is extremely frustrating!
0.720000	I think that the doctor has my best health and happiness in mind when making decisions. I ultimately think that the doctor makes a lot of money, but that this also motivates him to give me the best available care.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I trust my doctor because he has a degree and went through a lot of tests to ensure he knows what he is doing and is good at it. He see's a bunch of other patients who also think highly of him which is what in return I trust and believe the same about him. He has a lot of education and does a lot of good things in his profession.
0.640000	I want to trust my doctor, or any doctor. I sometimes have a hard time doing so though because all-in-all, it is just a profession and if these doctors fixed all sick people and issues happened less and less, doctors jobs would become more and more scarce so some things are not treated properly or correctly so that it can keep people in the healthcare system to make money and keep doctor's jobs.
0.480000	My doctor is intelligent and easy to open up to for the most part.  But sometimes I feel rushed.  Sometimes I feel she is a bit condescending or quick to jump to conclusions.  I generally feel she is not as thorough as I would like.  I supplement the visit with a lot of internet research.  I mainly go to her for basic checkups.  It's very hard to find a doctor who you really like, who listens to you, who doesn't rush you, who you trust, who you feel comfortable talking openly with, who is non judgemental, who takes your insurance and continues to take your insurance, who gives you good answers to your medical problems, who has a competent and caring staff.  In the end I think most people settle for someone who meets some of those characteristics.  Or maybe they just stay with a doctor they are unhappy with.  Sometimes you can't always find what you want.  But I do think the medical professionals and the insurance industry should do a lot better.
0.760000	i trust my doctor because he treats well and gives all the information i need. whether its good or bad. there is an app where all the lab reports are uploaded directly and he has asked me to log in to it so that i dont feel anything is hidden from me
0.760000	He/She has a full record of all my medical history at there fingertips.  They can order new tests and/or labs easily which can often be done in the same facility.  I have had one doctor before moving for over ten years which enabled him to get to know me a bit personally which I think helped the overall care.  This facilitated discussion on lifestyle and care out side the clinic. Often, they new colleagues in the same medical plan that would be a good fit for me in other areas of care such as back doctors or physical therapy.
0.880000	She takes time to concentrate on my problems and my needs. She always offers me the best advices and guidelines
0.560000	I am neutral in trusting my primary care physician due to having a negative experience during my childhood where I was misdiagnosed multiple times and given wrong advice/information regarding my health. It got to the point where it was almost too late for me to survive because my parents were being told that their child only had a cold/fever. Outside of that experience, I normally do not put that much trust in a person regardless of it being their profession because some people only have their own interests in mind.
1.000000	My doctor has always been very well educated on any problems that i've had. He is very intuitive and understanding and will always give me an honest answer regardless of the situation. His dedication to his patients has been simply amazing.
0.880000	"I mostly trust my primary care physician because he is usually right when deciding what is wrong with me. But I do have doubt's wondering if he is always right when deciding what is wrong with me because he has said in the past, ""Try this medicine to see if it goes away and if it's still the same come back."" It makes me wonder if the physician knows what they are doing and if he will be able to help the next time I am sick and know what is wrong with me."
0.560000	I trust that my doctor can provide basic care and advice but I do not believe they keep up-to-date on new treatments.  I'm also not confident in their knowledge of things outside their specific scope of practice.  As with all professions, some doctors are very good and knowledge an a majority land somewhere in the middle of competence.
0.720000	Usually my appointments are so quick I feel like they just want to get me in and out of the office as quickly as possible and are annoyed if I ask too many questions
0.720000	I go to a medical professional for their knowledge and expertise. If I don't feel comfortable with the information or advice, I feel confident in my own ability to seek a second opinion or read up on treatment options.
0.560000	As to doctors in general, I don't trust them completely because they will often do what is best for them rather than what is best for the patient. For instance, they may not prescribe a patient with chronic pain the right medication because they don't want to prescribe certain drugs.
0.800000	I feel comfortable with her.  I believe she has the same philosophy as me as to healing holistically vs. medically. 
0.760000	I trust them most of the time but I tend to not rely too much on their answers when it comes to what medicines to prescribe. I was told by another physician that many doctors have contracts with certain pharmaceutical companies, and because of this they are persuaded to recommend that company's medications, even though they know it won't fix their pain or conditions. Since they have a contract, they are forced to push the company they have a contract with's products over others. 
0.760000	So the surgery went incredibly well with only one nurse having poor bedside manner. The issue was the follow-up procedures. Radiation was all set up and ready to go before a sudden visit to the oncologist was scheduled. And we were informed that we were a month behind schedule. After that, suddenly radiation had to be pushed back over two months so four sessions of chemo could be forced through. We don't go to the first surgeon/general practitioner anymore. Apparently that's common with most surgeons: once they're done with you, you yourself don't need help anymore, even if you clearly do.
0.400000	I think that the doctors I have used are traditional thinkers and that they refuse to think about alternatives other than traditional treatments. I do not think they take into account other options, especially holistic treatments.
0.560000	I have neutral trust of my doctor. While I do believe he primarily acts with integrity, he will spend 20 minutes lecturing me on healthcare issues that I'm not there to address, leaving the real needs unattended. Namely, he spends the entire explaining to me that I shouldn't drink at all, ever. In return, I lie and say I don't drink. 
0.480000	I haven't gone to see my doctor for a while because I haven't had any new, pressing issues, but I do believe that, in general, doctors have an expert opinion that cannot be gained from internet sources such as WebMD. However, with the fairly broken medical system we have in America, I also understand that many doctors may have profit motives outside of simply providing the best care possible, and so I question choices and opinions when possible. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I know a lot of other people who see her too.  Others in the medical field have told me how good she is too. 
0.800000	My doctor is fairly new to me.  I have only seen her a couple of times.  So far, I feel that she is trustworthy and has explained why the need for certain tests and paths of treatment.  She is educated, warm and very friendly
0.960000	I trust my neurologist because she is very knowledgeable and informed regarding all of my medical conditions. I have complete trust in her
0.680000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years. I have gone to him for my ongoing health issues. I trust his treatment options and decisions. If I don't agree with something or a medication prescribed, he is open to listening to what I have to say. He does not rush me through an appointment like some of my previous doctors. For this reason, I have complete trust in my primary care physician.
0.520000	I have had good and bad doctors before. The good ones really seem to care and take the time to listen. They are able to help me thoroughly. Very few doctors have been bad. They seem to not listen and want to prescribe something that I don't agree with.
0.680000	I do trust my physician, but only when we engage in a discussion and come up with a mutual plan for my treatment. If I do not advocate for myself, I feel like he may not put forth as much effort in my treatment
0.640000	I distrust most doctors because I believe they are mostly concerned about money.  Most of them don't care how your health really is.
0.800000	I have been seeing my pcp for the last 20 years.  he is kind, thoughtful, and smart.  He sees his patients as people, and has a full understanding of their needs.  He is an amazing doctor who has actual conversations with his patients.
0.760000	They take the time to listen to me and explain what they are doing and thinking. Sometimes they are rushed, but overall, I think they are doing well.  
1.000000	She spends lots of time answering my questions and discussing all facets of every situation.  She answers questions thoroughly and never seems like she's in a rush.  
0.800000	I trust my doctor to an extent. I am aware that no one doctor has all of the answers so i try to take her advice with a grain of salt
0.760000	My primary care physician has seen me a few times and has always thoroughly explained information about my health with me.  These discussions are backed up by data, and the correlations between what I am being told by my physician and the data I am being shown align.
0.640000	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN MY DOCTOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND HE KNOWS MY CHART. 
0.800000	I completely trust my doctor and his judgment. Thus far, he has always been professional, yet caring and compassionate. He fully explains his decisions and why they are the best for me. All of the risks and benefits or each option are given to me, as well as what he thinks is best and why. My doctor will also explain other options and why he would or would not choose them. 
0.680000	my doctor is very friendly with me and i relate to him as a person of similar age, race, and gender. we seem to get along almost as friends
0.640000	I often feel that doctors have their own agenda when it comes to diagnosing patients. After all the medical field is for profit. To that effect, I am cautious about completely trusting doctors. 
0.800000	My doctor has over thirty years of experience practicing medicine. This gives me a lot of confidence in his ability to care for me. He is very caring and through when treating any medical condition that I may have. I trust him greatly.
0.600000	I belong to a family care practice. I only go once a year for monitoring of my condition. Each time I go there is a new doctor right out of medical school assigned to me. The old doctor has moved on. It is hard to generate trust if the old face has gone somewhere else. 
1.000000	I have a lot of trust in my doctors. Case and point was last year when I wanted to change my birth control. I was on the pill and wanted to have the implant in my arm. My doctor came in before and went over all the other types of birth control and all the benefits and side effects to all of them. Once we got through that and I still wanted the implant she proceeded. While she was putting the implant in I asked her why she asked all those questions even though I scheduled the implant. She said she felt people didn't look at all the information that is out there and sometimes people don't know all the different options they have. She wanted me to know and understand all my options before going forward so I made the best decision for myself. 
0.640000	Sometimes I feel they are only in it for the money. I feel they might order something that I do not need done or some other added expense for no reason. Usually this is not the case and they are usually out for my best interest but I feel they sneak a few things in there. I can usually trust my provider to get me the help that I need and that they are being honest with me and careful to treat me right. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor implicitly. He is more internal medicine, so I have been able to see the same doctor since I was a child. My parents saw him, I even have a couple friends who were delivered by him. He has been practicing medicine in the community for decades longer than I've been alive, and he's always had excellent bedside manner. Everyone loves him. 
0.520000	I appreciate everything that physicians do for their patients, although I sometimes feel as though certain doctors are motivated to perform a particular action because of personal financial gain. That, or sometimes certain doctors do not show a great sense of genuine interest towards their patients.
0.720000	I trust my doctor with my medical health care needs. I don't have any reason not to trust her with my questions and concerns about my medical health care. 
0.920000	My doctor has been with me through all of my children, he has helped deliver them and he knows what i am interested in and what I am not interested in. He finds ways to bring other options on the table when I do not agree with what he or another doctor has said.
0.720000	I feel like we almost have no choice but to have a general trust in our doctors, right? Otherwise, what else is there? I am not naive enough to believe that there aren't plenty with special interests and motivations beyond doing their jobs well and with care, but a certain trust has to exist.
0.560000	I don't like spending money to see a doctor when I am not sick. I avoid hospitals at all costs because of the associated costs. I won't see a doctor unless I'm really sick/in immense pain.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she has never been wrong in diagnosing me. She has a caring and concerned bedside manner.
0.800000	I feel like if they have been through so much schooling, I should trust them as long as they keep up with new medical findings.
0.520000	I feel like most doctors just write prescriptions for whatever condition you may have and things like diet, exercise and more holistic options are not given to the patient. I would trust my doctor more if it seemed like they knew more about things other than drugs. 
1.000000	My doctor has always been very upfront and honest with me about my physical condition and what treatments I need to take even if they might not be what I want.  He always asks about my well being as about my family and will even recommend me to seek other consolation if it is beyond his expertise. I consider him a friend as well as a doctor.
0.440000	The way the laws are setup in this country I feel doctors have to tiptoe around certain issues. For example, If I am in severe pain I feel they would try as many remedies as possible before offering me pain medication due to the stigma the FDA puts on doctors who prescribe them. I feel like a criminal just asking for help with severe pain. If this is how they treat me with that one issue, what other issues are they making worse to protect their own license?
0.800000	I feel that my doctor is typically very attentive and does a thorough job. However, there are times where it feels like they might be rushing a bit. If I ever had something serious going on, I would definitely seek a second opinion so I do not blindly trust my doctor. 
0.920000	I have a PCP but I answered these questions regarding my OBGYN because that is the doctor I see most frequently as I have had 2 rough pregnancies over the past few years. I do trust her to take the best care of me. Last spring / summer, she made the decision that I should take progesterone shots beginning at 16 weeks and that I needed to be hospitalized during the second trimester of my pregnancy because of complications. I spent about 2 months there and because of the choices she made regarding my care, I was able to have a healthy baby boy at 35 weeks. She erred on the side of caution because she knew my previous baby had been born suddenly 7 weeks early. Moving forward, if I have any more children I will definitely want to continue under her care because I trust her.
0.360000	Alot of doctors care about making more money not about peoples actual needs. As in they make money off of giving prescriptions. You see so many people taking medicine. People dieing faster off taking medications prescribed by the doctor.
0.720000	i trust my primary care physician because i have been going to him for the longest time and i have not had any reason to believe otherwise
0.720000	They do have more schooling then I do and they continue to learn about different diseases and treatments. The one's I have seen pretty much put everything straight out there for you, they don't dance around the subjects and the sometimes admit they don't know what's wrong instead of just trying to label you and move you along. 
0.920000	I'm not a big doctor person. If I can solve it, fix it and feel better on my own then I'm going to. I like my primary care physician though because he understands my nerves and does his best to calm me down. He's been practicing for over 30 years so I feel confident that he has expansive knowledge. His office is modern and high tech, so I feel he keeps up with the times and is up to date with the latest procedures, drugs and treatments. He's always available on call and has no issues coming to the hospital to check on his patients all hours of the night. He's a family man and very trusting. I'm 100% happy and secure with my care in his hands.
0.720000	I just got a new Doctor and he is very good and explains everything to me very well which makes me feel like he is concerned and wants to make sure I understand.
0.960000	I have never had a problem with any medical advice he has given me.He has always listened to what I have to say and answers any questions I have.
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary physician for over 20 years. He takes care of my physical health as well as mental health. He is always honest about treatment options and I feel he cares deeply about being thorough and careful.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because that is what she went to school for. She has been trained in a way that people that are not doctor arent. 
0.560000	He always seems busy and I have had him misdiagnose something to where I had to return for a follow up and  different treatment due to him not spending the time initially.  I am currently searching for a new DR. 
0.600000	I sometimes don't trust my doctor because of her negative reviews that are public on Google. However she is usually kind to me and tries to suggest what her opinions are rather than making it sound like that's absolutely the problem. She tends to prescribe me something to see if it helps and tells me to come back at a later date if the problem still persists. 
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because he also took care of my mother while she battled a terminal illness. We became close with him during that time and he did a lot for my mom. His care went above and beyond and that has made me trust him very much.
1.000000	I like my doctor and I can relate to him. He's a very funny guy, uses humor to relax his patients and to communicate.  It works!  He gets to the heart of the matter quickly.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician in that I believe that he will have my best interests in mind while not trying to rush me out of the door to see the next patient.
0.640000	I trust my Primary care physician for the most part, however, if he were to put me on a drug of some sort, I'm not sure he would be open to exploring all drugs used to treat a condition, or if he would choose the drug that he is comfortable with, or the drug of the sales rep that brought in lunch that day.  Overall, though, I do think he has my best interests at heart and wouldn't do anything to harm me.
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because he also has experience in alternative medicine. He takes in consideration that you are a whole person(body,mind,and spirit). He is honest about what your options are when he tells you the symptoms. .  
0.800000	I generally trust my doctor since he doesn't speak condescendingly or brush aside questions/concerns. He answers them patiently and thoroughly. I've been researching and trying different medications and each time I suggest one, he makes sure I know the side effects, the neurotransmitters involved, and its off-label uses before filling the prescription.
0.920000	I trust that my doctors are following the oath they made to do no harm. Additionally, I believe in science and believe that the doctors who have years more training than I do are far more capable than I am in this regard. However, I do think that it's important to tell them when you are experiencing side effects etc. so you can get a treatment that works for you. 
0.760000	I could only say that I can't agree totally on number one because I have personally seen that my doctor's waiting room was empty without patients being seen at the time and have still been made to wait excessive amounts of time for my own appointments on numerous occasions.
0.720000	Because as much as they are trained to remove personal opinions it is near impossible for slight bias' not to be within a doctors recommendation. Also what they are more familiar with they will feel more comfortable recommending. For example a surgeon will always be more comfortable with a surgical approach, while an internist with a medicinal approach. All advice in life should always be taken with a grain of salt. 
0.480000	I do not feel like my doctor is committed to getting me the best treatment. I like my doctor but I don't think that she views me as much else than an insurance claim.
0.800000	I feel like she takes times with me and really tries to understand what is going on with me. She asks me a lot of questions. She never rushes me. She runs a lot of tests if necessary. If she can't find answers she refers me to someone else. 
0.800000	In the past, I have not trusted my physicians. I felt they did not take the time to follow through with care.  My current doctor is thorough and seems to care to exhaust all possible ways to figure out to make me feel better and also seems to notice how a patient feels at the time of the visit
0.800000	I feel comfortable talking to my doctor(s), and if I have questions or concerns I don't have a problem asking. Also, if there are side effects I ask about those, or potentially alternative treatments. I have always felt that my doctor was able to explain things in a straightforward way that I understood. 
1.000000	He's a trained professional and has always been open and honest with me and always lays out the options for treatment when I have any issues.  He's polite courteous and very intelligent.  
0.800000	I would rather select slightly agree but that's not an option. I've only been seeng this doctor for over a year. About 4 visits because the doctors sometimes rotate or finish their residency. I have to be my own advocate and never completely trust someone with your life in their hands without doing a little of your own research first.
0.840000	MY PULMONARY DOCTOR IS THE ONE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF MY LUNG FIBROSIS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP MY GOING SINCE 2008. I HAVE GONE TO MAYO CLINIC WITH HIS SUGGESTION TO GET SECOND OPINIONS TWICE AND MAYO AND MY PULMONARY DOCTOR COME TOGETHER WITH A PLAN TO EFFECTIVELY KEEP ME GOING.
0.480000	I honestly don't have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I say that mainly because I haven't had a lot of interaction with him. In addition to that my interactions that I've had with him have not been really positive. I've felt rushed in those interactions and I don't get a sense of him really caring about well being of his patients.
0.560000	I trust my doctor because he fully listens to me. I never have a problem with my doctor listening to my worries or health concerns.
0.440000	My primary care doctor is part of a large company. That company has huge turnaround, a huge patient base and relies heavily on billing. My primary care doctor probably wouldn't recognize me on the street.
0.920000	 My primary care doctor had shown diligence in researching ways to help me personally. She knows my conditions and is careful to address all of my concerns. I trust her because she's earned that trust over time. 
0.880000	My primary care physician has become a friend and is concerned about my health beyond medical appointments.  She acknowledges when she doesn't know a detail, researches and follows up with an answer.  She's active in her professional community, speaking and writing.  
0.680000	I think that your doctor should be one of the most important people in your life. If you do not trust your doctor or if you do not have that bond with your doctor, then I think that you need to find one with which you can form that bond with. I think trust is the number one thing between doctor and patient. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they always take the time that they need in order to help me, even if they are backed up.   They never rush me.  They make sure that all of my questions are answered.
0.600000	I trust him because he is a good doctor that has always been able to treat what I am to see him for.  He is been in the same place for many years and has many patients so he must know what he is doing to stay in the same place for so long retaining so many patients.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is thorough, kind and takes ample time to explain everything that I need to know. 
1.000000	I like and trust my PC physcian because we actually discuss my issues, treatments and options, I can bring up ideas she has not brought up and we can discuss them, she is open,  I can make my decision based on my needs and she is supportive.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because I know they put in the time to learn the skill. I also trust them because they keep up on everything.
0.720000	For the most part, I think doctors are trustworthy. However, they are very busy and see a lot of patients, so they could make mistakes, just like everyone else.
0.640000	My doctor told me to stop asking questions about medications and just trust her. I did not think that was a good answer.
0.720000	I feel like I can trust my primary care physician because I do not sense that he would provide bad advice.  I do sometimes have concerns because while his intentions are good he might not be aware of every condition or treatment option.  Sometimes I feel like seeing a specialist is the best alternative.
0.800000	I generally trust my primary care physician because outside of the fact that he's gone to school for a long time to be a medical professional and knows a heck of a lot more than me, he also seems like a good person, who actually cares about his patients. The only reason I don't have complete trust of him, is he's still human, and humans make mistakes. Even Doctors.That being said, even though I trust him, and the diagnoses he may make, or the medication he may put me on. I'm still going to do my own research on the topics at home.
0.800000	There are a few people in my life that I have to give complete trust to and my doctor is one of those people. He just comes across to me as being knowledgeable and sincere and I have the real impression that he is doing the best he can with the situation that presents itself. 
0.600000	I have collaborated professionally with doctors and know that they often do not know how to interpret the results of a drug or the results of a scientific paper. So I am a little hesitant to trust their knowledge as the perfect gospel. I trust doctors that are upfront, direct, and friendly.
0.920000	After numerous doctors that could not diagnose my conditions, I began seeing my current internist 5 years ago. After our first meeting she called me numerous times at home, sometimes in the evening to discuss past medical she found in my records. She always made time for me and what she could not do for me, she referred me to specialists where she monitors my care with each. My life and health are better as a result.
0.600000	In general I do think that doctors act in the patient's interest and would at least put a good amount of stock in what they tell me.  But at the same time I have my reservations about total trust.  Especially the more serious the medical situation is, the more likely I would want other opinions.  But for routine things, I figure the doctor knows how to handle the situation.
0.480000	Doctors do what the hiarchy tells them what to do. In this day and age, our health condition is a push-pull battle between our insurance plans, and how much influence the drug companies have over the doctor's profit potentual for prescribing what is best in their best income, not what is best for the patient. For that reason, I really don't trust anyone unless I can verify their recommendations without a shadow of a doubt that they are not selling me out.
0.920000	My primary care doctor has been in the medical profession for many years and is very well-respected in our local community.  He is direct and honest, and open to ideas about my and my family's treatment options. 
0.960000	I love my doctor. Any concerns I've ever had, he has listened to me carefully and has given advice when he can as appropriate. He is genuinely concerned about my well being. He likes to laugh and makes jokes when I see him. He seems happy when I come in for my check ups. He has never steered me in the wrong direction. He looks me in the eyes when we are speaking. He can gauge if I'm having not a great day just by the responses I give him. He's a great doctor and I completely trust him!
0.960000	I have been using the same doctor for over 20 years and have experienced a range of issues in which he has guided me well and with great empathy and no judgment. I have had no reason to question his judgment as he has been very wise and when he has insufficient knowledge, has directed me to people who have uniformly been knowledgable. We know each other well and have a great history.
0.920000	I try to have any issues I want to discuss written down and keep to a max of three things, if possible.  He always makes sure I am up to date with any shots I am suppose to have.  He tells me things for my own good health care.
0.520000	i know that doctors are experts, but they are often wrong about things. sometimes they dont listen to what the patient is really telling them.
0.560000	In general I almost never just trust one opinion from one physician. Specially if they are older as there is a chance that they are not up to date with the information (speaking from personal experience). I prefer always getting a second opinion and do my own research to learn as much as possible.
0.800000	I trust them as I have had them since I was about 7 years old and know them very very well. They are more like family at this point, for me. .I am grateful for this as they are a good person and very helpful to me. 
0.320000	I do not always have trust in my doctor because they always try to prescribe me medications for every problem that I have. I think that if they took the time to listen to me and understand my symptoms then I would achieve more of my therapeutic goals rather than having to try new medications every few weeks. 
0.760000	He has a lot of medical knowledge, and he cares a lot about his patients.  Most recently I went into see him to get a small internal bump in my inner thigh examined.  After he gave me a physical examination, he determined that it was not cancerous and posed little risk as he thought it was a cyst.  He gave me multiple options:  do nothing, an ultrasound, or surgical removal.  The fact that he gave me multiple treatment options shows me that he cares about my needs, and I am grateful that he puts a lot of the care decisions in the patients' hands while taking to explain the pros/cons of different treatment options.
1.000000	I've been going to the same GP for over 11 years now, so he knows all of my medical history and suggests what I should do to better improve my health. Usually he knows right away and can diagnose what is wrong with me when we talk and i get treated in a quick office visit.
0.720000	My doctor is a good and caring doctor, and I do feel he has my best interests at heart. However, I can tell he is busy and overscheduled.
0.640000	I think most doctors have the best intentions and do truly want to help but I feel like they are put in the position where they are not allowed to give their patients the time they need to in order to do their job thoroughly.
0.720000	For the most part doctors seem to want to help but they don't all have the time to spend with you to really figure out what is wrong. They usually go with the easiest course of action, which I understand is commonly the correct one. But, I cant tell you how many times people have had to go back multiple times just because the treatment they were given was for something they didn't have.
1.000000	I generally don't have any complex conditions and usually only receive preventative screenings. However, when I was pregnant and seeing a doctor on a regular basis, I do believe she had the depth of experience regarding my condition and trusted that she would provide great care for me. I followed her advice and believe my pregnancy had no issues because of her care.
0.480000	I believe for the most part my doctor sees hundreds of patients and is on a time restraint.  I feel that the rush to get people in and out makes looking for the most convenient option the first response. That the doctor does not know me or the other patients well enough to have a relationship beyond our charts that he barely looks over as he is coming in the room and that the nurse has actually more details and stake in personal care.
0.440000	It's not that I think my primary care physician is particularly untrustworthy. I just think people in general can at times be lazy, malicious, or in some way disincentivezed to help you. And it's not always easy to tell when that's the case. So I take what my doctor tells me as being probably true but potentially not the whole story, as I do with most people. For instance, I happen to know that doctors are under a lot of pressure right now to not prescribe opioids, so if my doctor tells me the best route for me is lots of ibuprofen, I'm going to be skeptical. But what other thinks am I not aware of, that might be relevant to my health? It's just best to get second opinions and take things with a grain of salt. 
0.760000	I have visited a lot of Primary Care Physicians and finally have one I trust. He is extremely knowledgeable and great at answering any question no matter how small. She gives me multiple treatment and medication options and lets me decide what path I would like to take.
0.840000	If I go to a mechanic, i assume he knows more about cars than me.  If i go to a physician I expect the same.  I am in no place to tell the doctor how I should be treated medically.
0.840000	Doctors seeing lower income people don't get reimbursed well. Medi-Cal reimbusement rates are dismal and doctors aren't getting paid to see these patients. This means less doctors come to the area and we don't have a wide enough incentive to bring in high quality doctors or even keep them well paid or keep their buildings looking nice. Their surroundings seem lower tier and they often have too many patients since there aren't enough doctors. The doctors I've seen required travel. If a doctor gets recommended by someone else, I'm more trusting of the doctor. While there are some red flags to some people, I've never had an issue with an doctor at a clinic or a big hospital. They've always been able to guide me to a solution.
0.720000	Why I trust my my primary care physician is because they are trained to help me feel better from the illnesses that I have. Also the physician would not be in this field if they did not want to help those around them. 
0.560000	I don't trust some doctors because they are on a higher pay grade and tend to have an eminence of superiority.  Don't get me wrong, some doctors are great, they seem to want to help.  To others I may feel like another cattle being strung along and they don't care if I end up in a dazzling meadow or at a slaughterhouse as long as they get their payment. In my situation (chronic rhinitis) I often have to asking prodding questions to really get any help on my issue.  Everything they have recommended hasn't helped at all, they say the cyst in my sinus doesn't matter, my jaw being realigned with palatal expander/braces doesn't matter, both these things seem like something worth investigating more, but they don't.  Sure I think they probably know better, but I don't count 100% on it.
0.640000	There might be lots of factors why a primary care physician make certain decisions. There could be influence from the practice to meet a certain quota when invoicing. Drug companies often have 'agreements' with practices so their products are preferred in the treatment of certain conditions. Sometimes practitioners are under time constraints so may opt to try a treatment for something non-life threatening and recheck later to assess response
0.640000	I generally trust my current doctor, and I think she's a lot more trustworthy than the ones I've seen before, and she always takes extra time to explain things to me and walk me through my health plan. However, I've only seen her a few times over the past couple of years, and I don't completely trust her yet. I guess I just have an ingrained distrust of doctors when it comes to prescribing medications due to previous negative experiences with them disregarding the side effects I was having and pushing medications on me that were not essential (such as birth control pills and certain sleeping pills).
0.520000	I don't feel like my doctor understands what I'm trying to communicate sometimes. He wants to do some test instead of actually listening to me, or he ships me off to another doctor who only knows part of the story. I would trust my doctor more if I thought he was actually hearing what I'm saying and if he would not be so dismissive of my insights into my own health.
0.800000	I generally trust them when there is no incentive to skew the truth. Even in that case they aren't lying they just aren't giving the best solution. 
0.720000	I have no reason not to trust these people. I would also expect someone to trust me in my profession just the same.
0.480000	"At the moment my primary care physician is a nurses assistant, not an actual DR. thanks to my insurance.  She is kind of knowledgeable but at my last visit she had to ""Ask Dr. Google""  to answer one of my questions which not only worries me but is something I could do myself for free."
0.480000	I do not have a primary care doctor. I rarely see a doctor. In my experience doctors always have bad news so I really don't have much trust in them. When my husband was sick there were a few doctors that were honest and thoughtful but the majority of them seemed disinterested and made the wrong decisions because they did not take the time to get updated on his condition.
0.680000	I have a great general physician, but I typically like to research my conditions and then review options with my doctor before making a decision. If I disagree, I seek a second opinion. 
0.560000	My doctor seems pretty neutral. The last time I went in, I had a question regarding this rough itchy spot on my skin. He didn't look at it and asked me if I've tried any over the counter steroid creams on it.
0.520000	I feel that my primary care physician has a very heavy work load and sometimes may be in such a rush that she misses something. She missed by back pain that was actually a kidney stone, for example.
0.640000	I trust him because he has given me good direction with my health. He is a little blunt so at times he has hurt my feelings. However, he is a good doctor and has given me good medical care for years. I just thinj he needs to work on his bedside manners. He has been my family doctor for years. I trust his judgement on medicines and whats best for my overall health. 
0.560000	I trust that my doctor would provide me with the best care that they thought was possible if there was a real serious concern about my health. I also feel that my doctor does not always listen to every symptom and she is only trying to get through her day. I think my doctor prescribes medication to easily and doesn't always look to see if the benefits out-weight the side effects.
0.640000	She sometimes will not listen to me and its my body. I once had to fix my ear infection because she would not help me. Now she listens to me.
0.840000	Well, I've only gone to my new PCP once but she really took her time to get to know me and my history.
0.720000	I trust him because he looks out for my well being, and if he prescribes something that I am not comfortable with after reading the side effects of reviews then he recommends or prescribes an alternative form of treatment
0.680000	My PCP has never steered me wrong. She doesn't take chances. She sends me for testing when she thinks there is something that does not look normal. She is very honest and doesn't sugar-coat anything for me. I appreciate her honesty very much.
0.920000	I have had nothing but positive experiences with doctors. They are highly trained and knowledgeable in their subject, I have no reason to doubt them.
0.800000	I trust my PCP because she has far more education than I do. She would never intentionally do anything that would cause me harm. I know that if something is wrong with me, she will figure out the best way to treat it.
0.560000	I am on the fence with doctors because I think to many of them have a god complex and have very little information on how diet can actually affect your health.
0.640000	My doctor spends more time with me during check-ups than any doctor ever has. She continues to ask questions, give me tips and pieces of information I wouldn't normally expect, and will even bring up questions regarding other possible issues I have to ensure there is nothing being missed. She truly listens to everything I say and never seems like she's rushing to get to the next patient. I feel she really does care about my health.
0.680000	I donât go to the doctor often. I see doctors as well educated people, and their decisions and diagnoses are more times correct than not. If I have a feeling theyâre wrong, I would let them know. As for prescribing medicine, as far as I know and what I have seen, doctors prefer prescribing the more expensive medicines so they themselves profit off of it. In that regard, although they arenât being dishonest, they arenât disclosing all options either. 
0.760000	"If the doctor is bad, it's likely that it would have been revealed by now to someone else. It's extremely unlikely that a doctor would be ""out to get me"" specifically. Furthermore, since I lack the necessary scientific knowledge to verify everything the doctor says, I have no real way to check what they say. Since it's unlikely that they're misleading me and attempting to verify them is impractical, there's little point in worrying about it. Of course, if someone does mislead me, I wouldn't hesitate to distrust them in particular."
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because his demeanor is very calm, friendly and because he is a good listener. He tends to be very patient, answers all of my questions and speaks with authority. When he has not been confident, he has sent me to a specialist rather than commit to a potentially inaccurate diagnosis.
0.720000	For the most part I trust him.  I don't think by any means he would want ill for me but occasionally when nothing seems urgent it feels like his patient overload becomes more important then my concerns.  Also sometimes I wish he would give more thought into different treatment when I may not be comfortable with what he was suggesting. Seems like first idea and his idea is the only idea.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear versus what I may want to hear. Hearing those true facts allow me to make sure I am aware of the decisions that I choose to make. I believe it is important to gain the trust in the doctor, so they know what your background story may be. Most times it is best if they share their own story to make myself or the patient feel more comfortable. this allows me to open up more to them and tell them whats writing frequently. 
0.800000	My doctor does not have any hesitation in telling me how it is with my health.  If I balk at doing something he is suggesting he will be very blunt on why it has to be done.  He has never steered me wrong, I trust what he says.
0.760000	I mostly trust my physician because they are a close family friend. They are usually pretty straightforward and honest with me.
0.720000	My doctor is a little impersonal so I dont distrust him but I dont trust him fully either, sometimes he very attentive and other times he is apathetic and doesnt give a care about me so its hard to decipher which day he is which.
0.800000	Generally the doctors I've had give the impression of compassion and empathy, and at the very least, they seem knowledgeable and confident.
0.840000	I have been going to my doctor for a very long time now. When ever I have a pain or any other problem with my health I head over to his office. With my major back pain issues he has always been stright forward with me. Always telling me the truth straight to my face even when I might not like it. He has always been correct about the cause of the pains or illnesses. His procedures and getting better plans have had a one hundred percent rate of effectiveness and I have always gotten better when I follow his instructions. I trust him because he gets things done correctly.
1.000000	My primary is part of a medical group that is responsive and communicative. I find throughout my health needs they explain all tests, procedures and issues. If I have questions I can call any time. Plus they have an excellent online presence for appointments, access to records, payments etc. 
0.480000	I do not fully trust my primary care physician because they have such a busy and hectic job.  How could they possibly always be able to perform well under their stressful work conditions?  They see patients for such a short time and it's hard to think they could always be right about what condition a person has, and what drug will make them better.
0.640000	I feel that my primary care physician is concerned with my best interest.  However, it is difficult to totally trust them knowing the lobbying they receive from pharma companies.  I often wonder if I really need the medicine they prescribe or if they are receiving a kickback for it.  On the other hand, my PCP spends a lot of time answering my questions and explaining treatment options.  I do not feel pushed to take medicine I am uncomfortable with.  All in all, I trust my doctor and am not considering switching. I just wish the healthcare system overall was more transparent!
0.360000	My doctor seems rushed just to get me out the door so they can move on to the next person. When I need things explained to me they bring in a nurse or someone else to speak with me. When I call with questions it sometimes takes days to get back to me.
0.640000	I think that my doctor is a good and genuinely knowledgeable person, but sometimes thinks he needs to dumb down explanations or ease my worries instead of giving me all the facts.
0.640000	If I don't understand something, I ask my doctor to explain it to me.   Afterwards, I usually follow up and research the issue more.   Rarely is my doctor incorrect in their explanations. In addition, they are able to provide referrals to good doctors (those respected in the community). My doctor also surrounds himself with competent staff.
0.800000	In all of my recent doctor visits, the doctors have suggested minor preventative things I could perform to better my health, that were completely unrelated to the original visit's intention. It wasn't necessary, but they care in general to see less patients.
0.880000	I come from a small community and there have been several times that myself or a family member has been in for one thing or another and it would not be uncommon for our Dr. to call the home phone or cell on his time off to see how we were doing and if something was not right he would meet you at hospital or even your home, all on his own time.
0.560000	My doctor seems to be on a timer. I don't feel he wants to spend any extra time because he has so many patients or whatever. The last time I saw him in November 2017, he more or less lectured me that I need to lose weight. My A1C was 7 so he appeared upset. I had a short visit and I'm scheduled to see him again in March of 2018. I may cancel the appointment.
0.680000	"Along with the strong development trend of the market economy, many social values have been changed: social relations, morals and morality are also reversed. For the medical industry, besides a number of achievements are very proud, a small part of the doctor insensitive to the pain of the patient, against the moral, contrary to conscience, doctrine, do ""stained ""The image of the noble profession of medicine has traditioned for many generations. So what is morality? What is yoga? What is the content of ethics? What are the causes of medical ethics? How to improve ethical issues in the health sector? These are urgent issues of the society today."
0.800000	My primary care physician seems genuine and thoughtful. She listens to all  my questions and never seems to be in a rush. She seems thorough in her examination and is kind.
0.880000	My doctor took the time to answer all my questions. My doctor followed up with me and sat down with me one on one for as long as it took for every concern. She is very kind and did not make me feel like I was burdening her. She called me and made sure I was okay after a procedure and made sure I did not have any other questions she could help answer. all in all she made me feel very comfortable. Even the nurses were very prompt in returning calls and making me feel like I was the only patient they had. I hope everyone has the same experiences I did during that difficult time. 
0.800000	I have known my primary care physician for a long time and he has always been honest with me. I have never had an incident where my doctor lead me wrong or caused something negative
0.600000	"Normally, I would say that I trust my primary care physician, however, there are times where they've ""dropped the ball"" on important physical issues/experiences that I've encountered, elongating the amount of time it takes to receive treatment."
0.800000	After a few problems with doctors ignoring my concerns (I spent years with a vitamin deficiency b/c the doc would order bloodwork and insisted it was all in my head) I found an extremely thorough doctor that listens to me. 
0.840000	My doctor has been very helpful by working in conjunction with me to address any health issues that I have had. She listens to my concerns and understands that I am an involved patient. Because she listens to my input, I trust her to work with me toward responsible health goals.
1.000000	They are passionate about what they do and took an oath to uphold a certain code to protect people in every way that they can.
0.720000	I trust doctors but only as far as I can throw them. There is still a line of distraction in them, and that they do not exist inside of you. You still need to be informed and ask questions 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing this doctor for twenty-plus years. He always takes the time to explain things and ask questions to understand what is going on with me. I always get the proper treatment for whatever ails me.
0.800000	I trust the doctor I have now because he listens to me and is willing to do a large number of tests if necessary to find out what is going on. He doesn't regard my symptoms as something unimportant. If he can't figure out what's going on he refers me to a specialist in that area. In the past my doctors would act as though they didn't need to listen to me because they already knew what was happening. They wouldn't order tests, so it took me much longer to be properly diagnosed. 
0.880000	the most doctors are very skilled and human, so in this way, all of them are very trustworthy and helpful to their patients, and i have complete and total trust on what they say
0.760000	I trust her because she trusts me. I feel that I can talk to her honestly, and I expect her to be blunt in return. Most recently, she was worried about my cholesterol level but I was reluctant to go on new meds. She agreed that I could try to bring it down with lifestyle changes, so she gave me some diet tips instead of a prescription. With changes in diet and exercise, I brought it down 53 points. 
0.520000	I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because they are very professional, experienced, and knowledgeable. They have never done anything detrimental to my health.  
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a very competent and experienced medically trained physician who is familiar with various illnesses and treatment options who seems to care for his patients..
0.600000	I think doctors get rushed by office managers. I also think insurance reimbursements to doctors are diminishing so the doctors are having to see more people in the same amount of time and this results in subpar focus and attention. I also think doctors get into a 'groove' and tend to prescribe the same things and give the same diagnoses without giving extra thought to if there is more going on than it seems at first. 
0.880000	I trust my physician because he is generally caring and I see him over do himself daily for his patients. He gives patients his work and personal phone number so he can be reached at anytime day or night. He's also really good about what tests he orders or doesnt order to find out the cause of whatever is going on. He also listens to each and every patient for as long as is needed. He doesn't stick to the every fifteen minute schedule he's set to.
0.760000	He seems to know what it right for me. I do not have any trouble understanding what advice he gives me.
0.640000	"I mostly trust my doctor but sometimes I believe that doctors are only taught one way of thinking and therefore do not consider alternative treatments in all cases but rather use only drugs to ""fix"" issues."
0.760000	"I do not have a primary care physician, however, I did have to go to a doctor recently (possible kidney stones). He was a good doctor who, although busy, took the time to listen to my concerns and symptoms while keeping a ""playful/positive"" attitude. He treated me as though I was perfectly competent in my descriptions/concerns and, while listening to me describe my symptoms, stated what possible things could be causing my symptoms, and finally what he thought it was most likely to be. He was genuinely concerned about my comfort (I was in extreme pain...but I was a champ) and wanted to make sure the pain levels would be decreased before I left the office. He sent me to another doctor for a CT scan and, after I explained I don't have health insurance, made sure that he found the best payment options/route for what I needed done as opposed to just charging me one set rate. I trusted his opinion and appreciated his compassion and humor. In general, this has been my experience with most doctors...busy, but compassionate."
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician is because I've been with him a very long time. He is very thorough and honest with me every time I go to see him.Therefore I trust him completely.
0.960000	I guess when a primary care physician attempts to connect with me even though I know it is standard, it makes me feel like I can trust them. 
0.920000	I have had my Doctor as my Primary Care for over 10 years and he is very open an honest with me and  very straight forward, he doesn't pretend just tells me straight and that what I like.
1.000000	"I work for a world-renowned health system with some of the best doctors in the US. I always look to see where they attended school, I have access to their ""heath scores"", and if I have to I'll ask my boss, who is the CEO.  They were able to diagnose that I had an autoimmune disease that usually takes 12 years to diagnose."
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he tells me the whole truth about my health.  there's no sugar coating anything and he gives me all of the best available options for helping to continue to be in great shape.  All of the advice he's given me has worked, so I will continue to trust in his advice and recommendations.    
0.400000	It's rare I visit with a doctor that seems genuinely concerned or one that assumes his first diagnosis isn't correct. All seem to be THE expert. Some seem tired of the repetitiveness of their practice. And most seem to prescribe a specific, expensive drug, when there are other options available.
0.600000	Mostly I feel like I am just a number to them. They seem to always choose the most expensive procedures and treatments. A lot of medical professionals are arrogant and selfish.
0.320000	I can never get a straight answer out of him. Every time that i go to the doctor feeling bad he tells me i have a virus or just tells me that he isnt sure what i have, but he will still prescribe steroids or antibiotics. Sometimes i worry that i may have a serious problem that wont get fixed because he doesnt put the proper care into figuring out what is wrong with me.
0.840000	My Primary care doctor has always been there for me when I have questions. I can communicate with her via email and she will see me if I really need to come in with almost no advance notice.  She explains things well and cares if I  am OK.
0.800000	The methods implemented by my doctor to help me have always worked in the past. I have asked my doctor questions about why they wanted to be a doctor and what kind of education they have. Therefore, I know my doctor is passionate about their profession and wanting to help people. My doctor communicates with me promptly when I have a question or concern about my health. My doctor also has a good bedside manner, is always respectful, and does not make inappropriate comments. I know my doctor will be up front with me when I ask them difficult questions.
0.800000	I didn't have a primary doctor for quite a while because I didn't think I really needed one.  I had to get a referral to see a neurologist, so I saw one recently for that.  She was so nice and made me feel very comfortable.  She compared some digestive issues that I'm having to problems that her daughter is having and gave me good advice on solving the problem. She seemed very down to earth and trustworthy.
1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician, they genuinely care about my well being. If I have an issue, regardless if it seems minor to me, my doctor always insists for me to make an appointment. My doctor possesses the proper credentials and has board certification.  
0.840000	I trust that my doctor is looking out for my best interest as I could give him a bad review otherwise.
0.840000	Before I choose a physician or hospital that I would go to ER visit I always check the reviews and I always do my research and up to now I've had great confidence with all the positions are hospitals that I have chosen
1.000000	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY PCP. HE IS YOUNG, TRUSTWORTHY, FRIENDLY, PROFESSIONAL AND HAS A GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER. I RECOMMEND HIM HIGHLY AND HAVE NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM AND WILL NOT CHANGE PCP'S. 
0.920000	My Primary care doctor spends time with me and answers all my questions, tells me if I need to be concerned about something and doesn't waste my time if I don't. I have asked for him on the phone and he answers my calls and emails promptly if I have concerns.
0.560000	I believe my doctor does the best he can under the time constraints he has because he does see so many patients. He will suggest a treatment that has worked for most of his patients. If that fails to help, he is open to trying other treatment plans. My lack of complete trust is due to my doctor's limited time to spend with each patient. 
0.880000	I generally trust my doctor as they have gone to medical school and see many things that make it so they learn a great deal. At the same time I do like to look into things myself. I'm not one that likes to take medications that have side effects and care a great deal about knowing what I'm dealing with medically.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he is caring and concern about my health throughout the years. He also does an exceptional job taking care of his patients and very loyal to them.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician. She is empathetic, thorough, and a great communicator. She always takes the time to thoroughly explain things. I never feel like she is in a rush.
0.520000	I don't trust doctors because I think they put a band-aid on the problem instead of solution trying to fix the problem. For example, doctors over-prescribing opioids to relieve pain.  
0.800000	I have rarely had a bad experience with a doctor.  Also, I don't have much choice.  What else would i do?
0.680000	I trust my primary care doctor as he is a quite a bit honest person, and very direct on any health topics, and provides different options and explains everything very clearly and answers thoroughly any questions I might have, and even he listens to me and try to understand my feelings on some sensitive topics. He is also one of the highest rated doctor in my area as a trustworthy doctor. So so net net my experience with him is very good that is why I trust him.
0.720000	I am generally trusting of doctors but I do like to do some research on my own as well -- forewarned is forearmed.
0.520000	Haven't had all that many interactions with primary care doctors but they're usually rushed and seem more about getting through the interaction than anything else. Jaded, too.
0.760000	I dont really have much of an option to not trust my doctor. If i didn't trust my doctor, then i need to find one that i can. Besides that, i feel that they are the expert in their field just as i am an expert in my field. They should know what they are talking about and if they dont, they should either tell me they dont, or find someone that does.
0.720000	I haven't seen my primary care doctor all that often and usually when I do it's for pretty straight for things such as a broken arm or a physical. In other words, it's hard for me to quantify my trust in my doctor because I've never been put in a situation where trust can be questioned.
0.280000	"I do not trust my doctors because I have asked them simple questions sometimes and they give me the most basic answer so they don't have to waste their time answering me properly. Example, I asked what type of blood I am and the response I got was: ""Oh, now the type of blood is no longer as easy as a letter. It's complicated. It's a number of letters and numbers. Don't worry about that."" Also, my doctor put me on the wrong treatment once and it lasted for months. "
0.680000	I think that most doctors are very trustworthy and careful about there jobs and recommendations.  There are always people that might not care about their jobs as much in any area of business.
0.560000	Nobody knows me or my body better than me. No degree or amount of years in school can make anybody the person who knows me better.
0.600000	i don't trust anyone fully but that doesn't mean i automatically distrust them either..........................
0.600000	I trust some doctors, but I also think that it's more about making money.

1.000000	I trust my doctor because they have my best interests at heart because they know what is best for me.  The doctor tells me what I need to do because they care about me and my needs.  My doctor is very caring and they treat me correctly and very professionally.

0.600000	Because I been hearing a lot of stuff about doctors nowadays and I really don't like doctors and they make me nervous 
0.680000	Doctors are in the business of making money like everyone else. Sometimes, you'll get one that is more interested in the bottom line than in actually treating a patient. 
0.680000	I trust my health care provider to keep me looking and feeling healthy and give me great advice on my body and what I can do to improve

0.600000	My relationship with my doctor has really changed over the 15 years I have been going to him.  When I started seeing him he was a family practitioner and I trusted him a lot more.  Now he wants to specialize in geriatric medicine and he doesn't really seem interested in my primary care needs.  I am in the process of finding a new doctor but I haven't found one yet.
0.720000	They are always looking out for my health and making sure everything is good and I don't have any problems at all
0.600000	In trust my physician for the most part, and I say that because although he is a doctor or what not, he does not have all of the answers I may be seeking about a certain condition of how I am feeling.
1.000000	My doctor is from The Republic of Moldova.  She went to medical school in Russia.  Now she is in America and has a Natureopath license.  She restored my hearing in my right ear using lasers and ozonated tea tree oil/olive oil.  Now she is helping me to clear my lymphathic system.

0.760000	He often has a lot of patients to care for so they overlook things they may be a big deal to us. One time I went to the doctor because I had a runny nose all the time and he gave me one look and told me that it was a sinus infection. I think it was something else 
0.800000	most doctors for the most part tell you up front what your health is like but it is up to the induvial to listen to the doctor and door what is needed to improve there health
1.000000	My nephrologist gives me 1000% because she knows that I am not afraid to take my illness head on. She has been my doctor for 20 years now.

0.520000	I distrust in in part because I feel that he is looking out for the facility rather than for the patient. It takes longer to get the real test that you need, because they want the doctors to try other things first.
0.640000	I am not the type of person that ever completely trust someone. Doctors are humans as well. They view things with the common eye and have to give prognosis. There are a lot of conditions that exist so I will always second guess what I'm being told.

0.720000	I've been with my PCP since I was a teenager and she is my mother's doctor. Sometimes I feel like not all the right questions are asked by the PA, but the actual doctor in the office is usually pretty thorough
0.560000	I trust my doctor but then I don't because I don't feel like they are giving me all the help I need at times but then again they do help at least keep me going in life with all my medical problems that I have right now but I feel like there is more they could do to help me so that's why I don't kinda trust them it's like they are just rushing through  patients at time to get over work and not actually looking to really help

0.480000	I find in hard to trust doctors because a lot of people become doctors for the wrong reason instead of becoming one to help people they become doctors because it's a high paying job.
0.960000	Whenever I've gone to see him for an issue he is able to help me. He prescribes medicine that works for me and if I need to follow up with him he tells me so.  He's thorough and I feel confident that he cares.
0.600000	I'm very middle of the road on this because of my own personal experiences. Ive never been mislead by a doctor but I do know people who believe they have, including close family members. So as with anything involving humans I don't completely put my faith in it.

Having me wait when he is doing absolutely nothing and conversing with nurses about nonsense when everyone besides him has a schedule.
0.680000	I have been with her for years she allows me to feel comfortable discussing my problems and tries to give solutions by referring me to specialists

0.200000	My doctor has sent me home with prescriptions for a cold when I was bent over in stomach pain.

0.640000	Doctors see so many patients they forget the experience is new for you, even though it may be their hundredth experience. Even though a lot of them may mean well, I would not put too much trust in their decisions because they have to answer to insurance companies as well.

I do believe there are a few that actually care though but they are scarce.
0.720000	I haven't had any reason not to trust my doctor. I have been traveling with the same physician for a number of years and he has been open and honest do fat
1.000000	My doctor talks to me more than he examines me and looks at test results.  He explains absolutely everything; even with pictures when I don't understand.  He insists that any problems I experience are related to my lifestyle.  He keeps  me on a low fat diet, limited alcohol, and a regular sleep schedule.  The only medication he gives me is for my eczema and sleeping pills that I should only take occasionally.  I'm instructed to return to him if I need to take the sleeping pills more than occasionally.  He gave me a nighttime routine that should help me get to sleep.  Long conversations and reviewing my blood pressure history, he discovered that my blood pressure is up only when I don't get enough sleep; so rather than blood pressure medication he wants me to get enough sleep.  
0.880000	My doctor takes the time to listen intently to my concerns and isn't afraid to say that she needs to do more research. She's very detailed and knows a lots about medical researches 
0.800000	she makes sure I take care of my self by making sure I see my specialist andd double checking what they say

0.560000	Although I may respect and trust my doctor's opinion, I also have into account the limited amount of time he has with me, and the fact that I am an individual and not everything will work the same for everyone.

0.760000	Overall I do trust what the medical provider says is true and reflects the best course of treatment needed.  \Than on the other hand I do think that because of insurance cost that some treatment options are delayed or not mentioned at all to cut cost.

0.680000	I don't she would tell you just anything for money. Alot of Dr's have had problems for just giving any information. She was highly recommended , so I think she gives good information. She explains everything . Her assistant is very thorough too. They are up to-date on new medications and procedures. She hasn't given a reason for distrust.
0.800000	I have been knowing him for awhile. He has a very great understanding of everything medical, and he has a great bedside manner.

0.240000	It seems that doctors rarely truly listen. They think they know everything and they should never be second guessed even though the field of medicine is still growing and learning and the physician didn't seem like they listened in the first place (but they know). Usually whenever I have a question they never answer it satisfactorily and without taking any tests and/or additional tests (for questions about my health that would require additional tests that no physician would know otherwise).
0.680000	I trust my doctor because my doctor hasn't given me reason not to. She answers any and all questions that I have.

0.600000	I feel that my doctor does all that he can with my health care, I just don't completely trust any of them.
0.400000	I have had a personal, plus three familial situations in which--two if the times, two different family members almost died because if a lack if thoroughness and misdiagnoses. I myself was mid handled during a very high risk pregnancy. Each of these times, I mystery of, was forced to tell the doctors what I felt should be considered it done. I must add, that all three if these instances did not take place at my preferred hospital, UVA, where I wish all three of us would have been treated.
0.680000	I feel that yes my doctor may be giving me the best knowledge about my health to the best of her ability, but she is not God who is the ultimate physician. So therefore I can't trust her word.
1.000000	He is takes time to explain my care plan and why certain test are necessary  he he is attentive a compassionate

0.480000	Doctors only care about paying off their student loans and when that is done getting as much money as they can to justify suffering through all that crap in their twenties. Nowadays all of the caring, bedside manner, and respect I have gotten comes from nurses. You barely see your doctor when you are hospitalized and when my mom was dying, it was the nurses who called to tell me, who sat with me after she died and helped me. The only thing the doctor on call did was pronounce her dead and run out of the door.

The first OB/GYN was trying to force me to have a c-section for no reason, the second didn't support unmedicated birth and my chiropractor implored me to change to a midwife because she specializes in pregnancy and found that her patients had more success with midwives for unmedicated birth. I also had a doula and the birth was still tense due to the overbearing OBs in the practice, who almost forced me to have a c-section as well. Thankfully my doula was there to fight for me to get the birth I wanted.

I was trying to decide what my best option is for birth control and at the end of the day I ended up not making a decision. I was so upset with my whole visit with the doctor in general that I have to choose another OBGYN. I was actually referred to the former OB.

0.560000	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples.

1.000000	MY DOCTOR IS HIGHLY EDUCATED WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE D AND HIS ADVICE HAS ALWAYS PROVEN TO BE RIGHT
0.480000	Sometimes doctors are all about what they think is best and not caring much about what the patient things. I say this from experience as with taking a medication I knew that was making me rather sick and the doctor not listening and not taking me off of the medication because he didn't feel the need to look into other options.
0.800000	She has been pretty accurate and her assessments of my health.  She gives me advice that is reasonable and feasible.

0.560000	I could create sentences. No need to. And since I'm gonna be forced to I'm going to probably get an attitude with this question. Pointless things like long waits and attitudes when patients ask for simple things ,- food, water, soda, etc. Those are the things people consume at home and could possibly help in the decision making process of healing. 
0.680000	He has many years of education and experience. But he is also most likely getting kickbacks from drug companies which may influence his prescribing of medicine.
0.720000	sometimes I think doctors deliberately hide information to keep you coming back to the doctor so they can earn more money off of people
0.320000	my doctor is knowledgeable but good gracious they do not have time for you. They are always in a hurry, are as impersonal as possible and that creates a perfect distrust for me.
0.800000	I trust my doctor and all doctors cause they go to school for a long long time and are very friendly and know it all when it comes to my health.

0.640000	all doctors are just after the money, and they are all in bed with the pharmaceutical companies vying for free trips an such. write prescriptions like its going out of style
0.520000	In most circumstances I put my faith in my doctor's opinion, though I am aware that physicians are often bribed by pharmaceutical companies in effort to increase prescriptions written for their given product.  As such I always like to do my own research or get a 2nd opinion on said issues.
0.760000	yes i trust primary care physician as they provide good services in hospital so that in future i dont get any trouble
0.920000	She always takes into considerations all my concerns and answers my questions thoroughly. Has a lot of patience with me, and never makes me feel judged or that she's basing her judgment on a stereotype or character judgment.

0.760000	I have a physician that takes the time to explain all of his decisions, I also look up his decisions on line at different sites
0.840000	My trust in my doctor depends on which doctor I go to. For instance, I trust my general physician and gynocologist but not my dermotologist because he doesn't give me a lot of attention and seems to be in it only for the money.
0.800000	Choosing the right doctor is often put in terms of trust. Can you trust the doctor to do the right thing? Start off with the idea that even very good doctors do the wrong things sometimes. There is so much to know. They may not know as much as someone elseâbut the good doctors will go out of their way to learn what they may not know.  And they will ask for help from other doctors. I would trust some doctors to treat some conditions out of their area of specialization more than I would trust a specialist in that field whom I knew was careless. They can be relied on to approach a medical problem carefully. I cannot describe what goes into having good clinical judgment, but it is a real thing. I am not sure exactly what quality of mind and character it involves. It is a kind of being sensible.
0.720000	I sometimes feel they're a bit rushed to get to the next patient, but I do feel they are listening to what I'm saying about the state of my health.
0.680000	Inboxd I am not a problem, I have been a long way. the only one that won't happen to know that you have a lot of people who are you a lot of people. the first to know about it, and the 
0.800000	I typically trust that doctors know how to treat and care for whatever health condition I'm dealing with if they can pinpoint it.
1.000000	Because I routinely ask probing questions about their opinions, medications, and treatment options. I rarely make up my mind about a Physician until I seen then on multiple occasions. Occasionally, I research their background and consult other physicians about their reputations.
0.720000	I trust them to do the right thing whenever possible. Listening to a patient explain their problems is utmost in doctors minds to assist them in recovery.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician. Although I might not always agree with his or her diagnosis, I have their trust and mine theirs. I would not go to a physician who I wouldn't trust. I need to feel comfortable talking about anything with my doctor. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor to give me the right advice concerning my health and give me information on how to take better care of myself. 
0.880000	He is a very caring person, who takes the time to really talk to and bond with his patients.  I am lucky to have found him.  We are short on physicians here in Hawaii.
0.800000	First of all its I do not trust to many people, do the doctors and nurses, police and everybody else falls into this category.
0.920000	My doctor takes time to listen to my questions and explains things in simple terms. He is very kind, compassionate and patient.
0.960000	My doctor is genuine and very caring.  She knows me and what my needs are.  She goes above the call of duty and asks me to call her if anything comes up or I have any questions.  She is a great listener and allows me to make suggestions.  She also takes the time to explain things and doesn't treat me a just another patient.  She asks the right questions and gives great advice.  
0.520000	Sometimes i know my body more and know how to react to things. I dont necessarily believe fully in pharmaceuticals. 
0.680000	For the most part, he seems to care. He seems to be very smart and thorough. He has made good judgement when it comes to my health care. He seems to be knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. He has a calming effect on me. I like his personality. 
0.560000	I take what any doctor says with a grain of salt.  I do not see them as gods or absolute authorities.  I do respect their knowledge, however I blend it with my own knowledge as well.  I'm the only one who has lived in my body all my life, therefore I am the authority of my body.
0.840000	They show that they care I never have trust issues they explain everything to me that I need to know and answer all questions
0.600000	Doctors do not all have the same opinion. Best to always have a second opinion, or third. At least I would do this.
0.440000	I don't trust doctors because they are only doctors so they can make big bucks, not because they care about helping people. They do not listen to what you tell them, they are in a hurry to get you in and out so they can charge you the money and get on to the next person.
0.520000	It's difficult for my PCP to find the time to see me, and when she does, I almost always feel rushed and unable to get through my appointment in a timely manner.
0.360000	"My doctor doesn't take the time to listen. She makes it a priority to only spend so much time with you. She even said to me last time ""I don't think I'll have time for that today"" Didn't offer another appointment either. It was an issue I was really concerned about. I told her I was worried and she did give me an extra 3 minutes and a referral. I'm glad I'm being assigned a new doctor in a month "
0.480000	The majority of doctors I've seen dismiss what I say and treat me like a number. They're always in a rush and want to just get in and out, instead of taking the time to listen to what my concerns are. They just want to shove pills at you and get you out the door, instead of exploring underlying issues.
0.840000	They know me pretty well and have my best interest at heart however they are busy so if I really need something I will remind them
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for many years and has always done the correct thing pertaining to any sickness I've had. He has never treated me wrong or diagnosed me with the wrong illness. 
1.000000	My doctor has never treated me without respect and has worked with me in the past years to help me stay healthy. Since I don't have any physical or mental conditions to deal with my annual checkup is normally without incident or problems.
0.880000	I just began seeing a new physician since my previous one retired. She is extremely intelligent and is totally aware of my medical history and how to treat and prevent any issues that I may have.
0.760000	He seems to be open, honest and checks everything out!!  Takes the time to explain everything and gives me more than one option
0.800000	My doctor is upbeat and personable.  She is younger than my previous doctor who was wonderful.  I trust her because she looks out for my best interests and does not insist I take drugs that I deem unsafe.  She is very knowlageable and competent.
0.560000	I don't necessarily trust doctors. Some are very trustworthy, others are not trustworthy at all. Doctors are often more caught up in imposing their ideas on their patients and don't actually listen to their patients. Too often they tell women that losing weight will fix all their problems or that they can't have a hysterectomy, even when it is medically called for, because they might want to have children later. Too many of them have relationships with drug companies that make it hard for them to be fair-minded about which treatments are best. Some of them haven't kept up with the latest in medical science news. 
0.720000	mostly trust but no one is perfect and dont hold them to 100.  If they do get something wrong or if they cant do what I expect then I can flex to what they are thinking or doing at the time
0.600000	The doctors these days seem not to care about the patient. They are only interested in how many patients they can see per day and how much money they can make. They don't seem to care about the patient and how they feel.
0.960000	Because he has always told the truth and he always gives me a solution to my discomforts or diseases
0.800000	They define the position for the organization, for potential applicants, and legally. If there's any question about whether a staff member is actually doing her job, or being asked to perform duties that have nothing to do with her position, the job description should clarify the situation. It should also make it clear who's ultimately responsible for specific tasks or areas.
0.840000	My doctor is thorough and caring. I know he keeps up with the latest research, because he mentions that. I am sure that he is doing the best he can.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I have informed myself of options and treatment prior to my doctors appointments.  that way I can listen to his proposals of treatment and decide in a positive way if I think he is on top of my situation and treatments.
1.000000	I trust my primary doctor because he is very thorough with his examinations.i trust.my doctor. I will continue to see him as my doctor. 
0.720000	I don't trust the government which employs doctors. They put stuff in our medicine that makes us worst or sick and these doctors just follow. 
0.920000	if I did not trust him I would not continue to go to him.  he always explains things well and in words that I can understand
1.000000	I have had my primary care doctor for about 25 years now, so I trust her completely. She is always upfront and honest with me all the time. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he is dealing with someone's health and helping them survive.  Doctors want to help people that's whey they become doctors and why they are committed.
0.800000	I trust my psychiatrist because I've been seeing him for years. This is someone who has seen me at my absolute worst, and has watched me pick myself up and turn my life around. I trust him because he never makes me feel judged or like I'm just another patient that needs to get in and out of his office. 
0.960000	My primary care physician suggests what is best for me.  They have never steered me wrong in the time that I've been seeing them.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he doesn't rush me out of the room and genuinely seems to care. He's gotten to know my family personally. I even have his cell phone number.
0.560000	I do not have a primary care dr. I just moved and havent found a new dr yet,will be finding one soon
0.840000	My doctor is out for my best interest. He will make decisions not based on his hospital's needs, but the patient.
0.840000	I trust her.. cause Ive had other doctors.. and shes now a female which und erstands my needs alittle better... and always gives me her open and honest opinion.. 
0.840000	I have had the same primary physician for almost thirty years.  he has earned my trust. he has always given me good advice and care.
0.800000	because me and my mom have been going to him over 15 years and he has never been wrong for both of us and seems honest and caring and always meets our needs
0.800000	I have a background in the medical field and am able to effectively build a rapport with my physician to ensure a trustworthy relationship 
0.960000	i believe they tell you the truth about everything and they are sincere and most of them are good doctors and treat there paitents very good i have a very good doctor who is always there when i need him
0.600000	For the most part I have complete trust in my doctor and his staff. Sometimes money does play a part though. 
0.680000	I dont trust all doctors but my primary physician is a very nice man. He is very thorough and honest but always uplifting and looks on the bright side.
0.800000	I trust my primary doctor to tell me what I need to know to take care of my health. I am confident she will give it to me straight. I trust what my doctor has to say.
0.560000	Being on Medicaid, I don't see Dr's but students who are still learning and sometimes don't know or make mistakes.
0.600000	Do not go to doctor. If I feel good, there is no reason to waste mine or the doctor's time and money.
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because he knows me well and has bewen my provider since 2002. Sometimes I feel he knows me better than me medically and personally.
0.600000	I do trust my doctor and they do get second opinions about my healthif not more opinionsand more tests 
0.840000	I Have A Caring Primary Physician Who I Have Known Intimately For Several Decades And To Whom I Can Communicate Very Easily.
0.600000	to explain the reasons is moot inane and asinine.  questions like this destroy the survey experience
0.560000	I think sometimes they see only what they want.  They ignore what I tell them in regards to symptoms.  If the symptoms do not match the tests or diagnosis they do not count.  So this is why I only trust doctors part way.
0.720000	I have a terrific pcp and I feel it's so easy to talk to her. I am also very strong about what is right for me, so as much as I trust her I make my own decisions.
0.720000	I have a reasonable amount of trust in my primary care physician, but I am not afraid to ask for and make sure I get a second or sometimes even a third opinion if I dont agree with what my pcp is saying.
0.760000	My Dr. is caring and compassionate. He will try to help people to the best of his ability. He takes time to listen and talk to his patients even when really busy.
0.880000	dr paddord has saved my life twice  once when i was septic and once when i was extremely anemic.transferring me to st. patrick hospital in missoula mt both times saved my life
0.760000	I trust my doctor. I have been giving second opinions from other doctors that have confirmed what my doctor said. 
0.640000	MY primary care is quite good, great bedside manner, willing to try whatever works. I've found she is better than other doctors I have seen, and is open to looking at studies, research, alternative treatments, and works WITH me.
1.000000	I had a really bad bout of panic/anxiety attacks over a year ago and that's when I reached out to my nurse practitioner. He has helped me through this whole process and still to this day. He is always there when I need to contact him and I have had to try a few different medications until I found the one I am on now (Paxil). He has helped me to understand everything I am feeling and has helped me make a complete 180 in my life. I am forever thankful for my nurse practitioner. He pulled me out of a very hard time, and it was something at the time, that I knew nothing about. So that was also scary to deal with at the time. 
0.480000	The doctor I've been seeing is mean and ignort. Can't ask him questions and get scared to say anything at all around him. Even his nurses look like they Dont want to ask anything
0.520000	they always wanting to try new medicines and treat you like a guinea pig, I am not willing to be one
0.640000	I believe people--including medical professionals--operate from their own built-in biases and those biases can result in a doctor's not offering up ALL options, choices and decisions that are out there for consideration. For example, if a doctor believes in saving lives at all costs, he's not likely to suggest hospice care to a patient who has entered or is close to entering the terminal phase of life.
0.760000	He spendsa gooda mount of time with me and makes me keep track of important health information and give it to him on our visits...then he really studies the info i give him.
0.440000	He has his head in his laptop more than he looks at me, he doesn't talk or explain things anymore, I am changing doctors soon.
0.840000	I have a good relationship with my doctor. I knew him for along time and he will always tell me the truth but, will let me decide what I want to do. He is willing to answer any questions I might have and give me the honest answer.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician so it is impossible for me to answer the above questions. For that reason I had to answer neutral.
0.760000	I believe most doctors do settle for medications when there are other alternatives available. Medications are very expensive, some doctors get kickbacks from sales. I believe most harsh medications actually cause worse physical reactions.
1.000000	i have had the same doctor for 22 years he tells me every thing about my health he holds nothing back he is trueful to me about my health and tells me what i need to do for my own good where i like it or not
0.680000	i like my doctor because he listens to me and has a lot of experience with different medical problems. he is personable and is smart about medications, side effects, different conditions, and health insurance
0.760000	My doctor is older and experienced. He is down to earth. He knows the answers to most of my questions. He is encouraging.
0.800000	My doctor does not seem rushed when she is with me. She is calm, takes her time, and explains everything.  If I have questions, she answers them fully. She never makes me feel stupid for asking any questions, and never makes me feel like she needs to get on to the next patient. I feel like I have her full attention. 
0.800000	My doctor has years of training and real live experiences.  He know more about my medical issues than I do
1.000000	I have had him for 25 years. We work together to keep me healthy. He considers the whole person not just the malady.
0.560000	I have a lack of trust with my GP.   She recommends one thing while my gynecologist, neurologist, and allergist recommend other avenues 
0.840000	she is the best out there, i know because we live in a small town and everyone knows everyone so everybody knows my doctor she is thoughtful explanatory and super nice
0.800000	i trust him but im smart enough to research things outside of the office to make sure he is correct in what hes telling
0.760000	She has delivered all 5 of my babies and she didn't miss a single one she takes the time to listen to me and even called my insurance company to help me out
0.800000	Because she has been kind and compassionate with me for many years.  She is easy to talk with and confide in.
0.600000	Feel doctors treat overweight patients a little differently.  Also led some by drug and insurance companies. Too many unnecessary tests.
0.840000	I have know my primary care physician for 15 years and have never had an issue with how she or her staff have treated me. She is also my wife's primary care dotor.
0.600000	I trust my doctor for the most part, but sometimes feel he takes the easy way by throwing medication at me even if it has a warning attach to it. 
0.680000	They sometimes just give pills to cure a situation without getting to the root of the cause.  They don't have time to discuss a plan that would work for me instead of pills.
0.560000	I think most doctor's have the best intentions but are rushed or pressured by external forces (billing, administration, etc) to make decisions that aren't always right.
0.760000	They are sincere and experienced, but would like to make a lot of money with my visits, which I do understand but most of the time the outcome is generated office visits.
0.560000	I sometimes trust and distrust doctor. I have had a bad experience when My mom passed away due to A doctor sugar coating things for my mom many years ago. He did not give her guidance or answer any questions about her illness, thus I have many trust issues with any doctor. Including dentist or a nurse. 
0.760000	HE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT  ME, IS ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND NOT IN A RUSH TO GET IT OVER WITH. NOT AFAID TO TELL ME I SHOULD LOST WEIGHT AND STOP EATING CERTAIN THINGS
0.600000	I trust in doctors in general because they studied during many years their carears and they are well prepared .
0.720000	My primary doctor is an associate professor at a large teaching hospital. He takes the time to listen to me. 
0.720000	Some I trust some I don't. All depends. There's honest to God willingness to help while others just want to milk the coverage plans
0.760000	My first visit was her questioning me about my health in general and if I had all the necessary test up todate?
0.560000	Medical care has declined as insurance provision has decreased.  Fewer people are seeking the education to become a doctor because they don't make enough money - this due to the low quality of insurance and the amount paid by insurance companies; therefore the quality of doctors has gone down and most doctors are foreign and don't speak good English.
1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician since I have been a long time patient of hers and she has kept me healthy all that time even though I have several problems that could make me unhealthy if not treated right.
0.800000	Thus far I haven't had a reason to not trust him, he's done a fine job with my care as far as I can tell.
0.960000	My doctor has been right about diagnoses for myself and my husband and treats us with appropriate medications for our needs with few side effects.  I feel I can rely on our doctors' advise and prognosis.
0.600000	I do not have medical insurance nor a PCP.  Thus, any statements relating to primary care physicians is moot.
0.760000	I don't trust my primary care physician very much. She is nice but doesn't know what to do with me at times when I get sick. There are very few times that she will call my specialists to ask for help or advice on how to treat me in the most effective way.
0.960000	I trust my physician because he is very nice and kind. and I feel that he wants the best for me. He gives me no reasons to not trust him.
0.960000	I am really comfortable talking to my doctor about treatments and medicines.  I have no problem  discussing anything I don't understand or feel that it's  not the right medicine or treatment for me.  My doctor and I have an open dialog
1.000000	I have been seeing my doctor for about 20 years now and have not been steered wrong. We have a close relationship and I can talk to him about anything.
0.600000	I used to not trust my other Doctor, but them I got rid of him and now I have a new doctor. I trust my new doctor a lot more than my old one. I don't put my trust in anyone too much, but I trust this new doctor a little bit more.
0.200000	I am in the process of changing Dr's. I recently have been mis-diagnosed and received wrong meds. Also not given blood tests that where needed in advance of cataract surgeru
1.000000	I will always trust my doctor because he is the best at what he does plus he very honest and open minded I can ask him anything  and hes always honest
0.600000	Doctors tend to just want to prescribe drugs whether or not you actually need them. It's how they're taught to do their job. 
0.880000	Our PC is extraordinarily thorough. If I cad to criticize anything, it would be that all of his concerns share the same high priority.
1.000000	My doctor is the bomb he listens to my and my needs. I trust him with my care. He is firm but kind and ice been seeing him for seven years.
0.640000	They know me better than I know myself and have always given me good advice and care. If I didn't trust them then I would probably switch to a different doctor. Trust is definitely important 
0.720000	easy to talk to have no medical problems that require anything extra than the usual  upkeep of yearly physical and any pre screenings that are for my age
0.960000	I have been with this doctor for almost my whole life and they also treat other friends i know and i just trust them alot
0.720000	Most doctors are trustworthy, their time is so valuable that they tend to cut to the chase and give only a few minutes and rarely find out how you really are doing.
0.240000	He does not listen.  He does not take my opinions into account.  He focuses on his objectives without considering other factors.  He is uncaring and does not follow standard protocols.  He literally blackmailed me into taking a drug I have serious concerns about, disregarding the threat(s) to my health that this drug creates.
0.680000	Sometimes doctors are preoccupied with administrative priorities rather than health care. It appears that the government has changed the meaning of health care
0.880000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. I trust him implicitly to attend to my health and well being.
0.760000	He knows my condition and what is the best form of treatment for me, always answers my questions and addresses my concerns
0.760000	My doctor is very blunt and tells it how it is. He tells me all the options and then tells me what he recommends.
0.360000	I feel my doctor is getting ready to retire and doesn't really care about anything anymore. He just hands out pills to everyone and doesn't reall explain what they are for or what they can do to you. Time to find a new doctor that cares.
0.600000	 When they make a diagnosis without hearing symptoms from me, and I feel rushed out with minimal dialogue. 
1.000000	My doctor always seems to be upfront and honest with me. He provides me with the information i need to be proactive in taking care of my health. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor, because she is the only one I have seen to diagnose me correctly and treat me accordingly. She has improved my day-to-day life, while the others have only done what they find convenient. 
0.720000	my primary care physicians have never given me a reason to distrust them so i trust them until there is a reason to distrust them.
0.560000	i have used the same physician for 20+ years. in the last few years, he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor who i felt was completely incompetent , he has hired a pa that is not  listening to me, is affiliated with a hospital where i spent 3 days in pure hell (incompetence running rampant.), renewed a prescription and then a month later called the pharmacy and cancelled it( it was blood pressure medicine..i can't believe these things are going on in his office without his knowledge..
0.400000	Doctor never listens to concerns and basically acts superior does not explain anything and rarely rechecks if I still have the symptoms
0.800000	The doctor appears to be well informed and caring in regards to the patients that are scene. There are times when they appear to be rushed though.
0.840000	Primary care physicians in general should be trusted by their patients. They are very good at what they do.
0.720000	For the most part, she isn't like most doctors. There have been a few times where we didn't agree on certain treatments, but in the end, we birth found something that was helpful to the both of us 
1.000000	She is blunt, yet caring. Very thorough and answers all questions to make sure I have a good understanding
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician, because I have been her patient for a while. She makes sure she asks me about my current condition. She listened to my concerns, and doesn't only give me one option when it comes to treatments. She also asks about my family and career.

1.000000	First of all, he is a Kaiser doctor and we have 40 years of not good but great experience there. After 10 years how could we not love him!
0.640000	they are giving me the right meds that are gettig my body back to where it needs t help and helpi me to feel better
0.600000	I have to have a cat scan in a few months for my back, and I had already gotten an X-Ray, my doctor says I should have a Cat scan, but I'm very small. I think a cat scan will be too powerful for my back and very harmful to my body, but my doctor didn't think differently. I hope when doctors make these decisions they think realistically with their patients. 
0.680000	Doctors are out for money and income.. They don't care about your welfare. They are not honest and care about your health.
0.320000	They are always in a hurry to be done and move in to the next patient I am not seenas the individual I am

0.600000	I trust my primary care physician a lot. She is always kind and helpful and she goes above and beyond to answer my questions and to help me understand everything. 
0.680000	I think there are always other alternative treatments beyond medication. However, the focus of treatment seems to be a prescribed medication rather than treating a condition with natural options.
0.880000	I have ab excellent relationship with my Doctor and feel she has the background and skills necessary to manage my health and health issues.

0.720000	When boredom strikes in the restrooms and customer service to you with the wedding is coming tomorrow night at family dollar store for a few years and I have to be a little more time to tell you that I get home I'll be there in a bit more of an effort in a bit more than the wedding is coming tomorrow night at the time but if the girl is still interested in a bit more than I was going to go to tell bay area of an effort in a bit more than I can count on the wedding and I get home I'll be back to the house 4th to tell bay friends and 
0.960000	I have chosen my doctor with care. He is kind thoughtful and though. He listens and remembers what I have said to him. 
0.720000	It is hard to trust him when he is rushed and not really answering my questions. I feel that he sees a lot of malingering and assumes that my issues are not as harmful as other people's. I tend to downplay my concerns. I don't want to be a bother to him.
0.800000	I do not know my doctor very well but the contact. Inhave had with her is all positive. She has answered all my questions and has been correct in her diagnosis of my conditions.
0.840000	I have been seeing my doctor for over 20 years, and he knows me very well. He is calm and careful and is able to make better recommendations because he knows about my family, my lifestyle, my history, etc. He stays current with medical literature and developments in healthcare.
0.680000	My doctor talks extensively with me about any feelings I may have regarding my health or treatment. I feel I can say anything to him or her (I have two physicians) about what I'm feeling or worried about, therefore, I feel I can trust them in my care & treatment.
0.640000	I believe mu doctor is too set in her own opinions, and reluctant to support my wishes which are based on my experience with previous doctors.
0.840000	"Although we don't know what is totally wrong with me, he hasn't given up looking for the answers and what might help me in the meantime. Never once did he think that it was ""all in my head"" as many would have. He always takes the time to listen to me even if it goes beyond the alloted time and never makes the appt feel rushed. He addresses all my concerns and conditions @ each visits. "
0.960000	My doctor takes time to talk to me about things going on in life (even politics) and not just my physical condition. Also she follows up with emails about how I'm doing and once when I was sure I had a bladder infection, all I did was email her and she prescribed what I needed. She explains treatments well and asks questions to make sure I understand. 
0.720000	I mostly trust my physician, however, I am concerned that he is not thorough enough.  I feel as though I have to request standard tests that should be routine for my age.

0.600000	I think I can trust my doctor enough to know what is wrong with me but i would get a second opinion if I had something big wrong or thought the answer was not up to par.
1.000000	Doctors are very well trained at what they do and how much they know. They have to keep doing continuing education to keep their skills up to par.
0.920000	I have had the same doctor for at least 10 years.  He has always been completely honest with me and spends a lot of time with me. He will get to the bottom of any discomfort I may have and makes me feel well taken care of.

0.840000	I trust my doctor because she is smart, caring, takes time to hear and listen to my issues. She genuinely cares for me.
0.840000	I feel my doctors have always been honest with me. They have always all options for a treatment and the informaion foe me to make a good decision
0.920000	If she does not know the solution to my problem she will refer me to someone who is an expert in that field.
0.800000	He reviews all my conditions with me, asks questions, and then follows up with personalized suggestions or comments.  
1.000000	my doctor is very upfront with me. she knows when i dont take meds regulary by results of blood screening, and will confront me with results in a compasionate way and in a way i understand.
0.800000	I have been with the same physician for over 20 years and he has never been wrong. He knows my history, takes time make sure I understand. 
0.640000	For the most part I feel the information provided is accurate, I don't believe the doctor would give wrong information intentionally and if I feel unsure a second opinion is ok to get.
0.680000	I have been going to the same dr for over 30 years. He knows me and all my ailments and quirks so I believe that he has my best interest in mind even if I don't aways agree with him. If anything he is a little over protective. I like the when my husband goes to see him, the dr always asks about me and visa versa when I go to see him. There are times I have had to fight with him to get my husband the specialized care I feel he needs but I dont have to fight too hard and when the office refused to see my husband once because he didn't have the co-pay, our Dr threw a fit and told them they are NEVER to do that again. He is more than our doctor, he is our friend.

0.600000	"My primary care physician is ""new"" (at least to me) and a bit young and naÃ¯ve. She knows practically nothing about diabetes, yet tries to micro-manage me and my condition, never understanding why her methods of treatment aren't working well. Thought my Endocrinologist and I had finally gotten my primary care doctor ""out of the picture,"" then she reared her ugly head again. Now I'm again faced with having to satisfy BOTH of them!"
0.840000	she been my doctor for so many years and all the sickness i had she got me through all of them. she alway tell me what is wrong and what i need to take and do to get better
0.840000	I do not thoroughly trust my primary physician I trust my cardiologist the most especially since I had a heart attack last month and a double bypass,I don't feel like my primary physician was doing all he should have prior to my having a heart attack  
0.800000	My doctor is very thorough. She has been since the very first time I met her. Only one time did I think she was extremely busy and didn't have the time to listen to all my aches and pains. But she is quick to refer me to another doctor. I was referred to a dermatologist and thank goodness because what I had turned out to be melanoma.
0.440000	I really have no reason to distrust my PCP.  So far, she has not proposed anything which I felt to be wrong.  Further, I'll ask questions should I feel uncertain.
0.760000	It's not that I don't trust him I just think he has limited information.  No one can be on top of all of the new treatments but I think he does the best he can.

1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician she is very thorough and explains everything to me so I understand it

0.560000	My doctor at times will rush me out the office instead of listening to my questions.  Therefore making me not trust in her as much ah I would like
0.600000	I had a doctor that did all of the things above and I trusted him completely but he left medical practice and went into administration.  I now have a new doctor and have only seen her a couple of times so there hasn't been time to develop the trust you need with a doctor.  So far this doctor seems only interested in making money off of the insurance companies.

1.000000	I have two Primary care physician's so I have the luxury of second opinions. I trust both of them as they have been my doctors for a long time and we have a good relationship that is open in every way.

0.360000	They do not discuss the real reasons for my visits.  They do not listen to my symptoms or how it affects my daily like.  I don't think a 15 min appointment is enough time to asses any condition.
0.720000	I truly trust my doctor. She seems concerned is always pleasant, answers my questions and gives me lots of options.
0.520000	I am on the fence about this one. Not having a specific promo art care doctor, it is a hard question to answer. I broke my ankle in November and was bounced from doctor to doctor to physical therapist to cat scan to everything else under the sun - I never got a straight answer, regardless of how many times I asked, if my ankle was truly broken and if I was doing damage by every single doctor telling me to do something different.

0.600000	I find that while my primary care physician offers thorough screenings, some of the information given at my appointments seems to be standard for everyone, rather than taken my personal medical history into account. I feel like the treatment is not always individualized.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for a long time and have had the opportunity to observe what he says about different aspects of my health compared to my own observations, both of which are quite close.

0.280000	Doctors only alot a certain amount of time for each patient (not long enough) causing them to rush through your visit with very little time to explain what's wrong with you let alone explain different procedures or treatment options.  Doctors also almost always jump to a pill, or a test or a procedure rather than trying a more down to earth, logical approach.

0.640000	i trust my doctor,it is the insurance cos. that i don't.They are in charge and make the rules they want.That is the framework drs. function within.A tratment must be insurance approved or you won't get it.
0.840000	I really like my primary doctor and while I trust that my health is important and he is very easy to talk to, he doesn't explore some things as much as I think he should and I have to insist on him doing so if I think he's not understanding the severity of an issue. He does not truly understand me as well as my previous primary care doctor so can be quick to dismiss something that I know needs more attention.
0.760000	My physician is very thorough and takes considerable time with me when I see him for an appointment.  He takes extra time to research the proper course of action.
0.840000	It at all will be the same way of furture and it will be the same way the sun will work and ur sun and the best way to come though and it was the same way to become true and it way   
0.560000	My doctor doesn't care too much about me he just tells me a few things and hands me a perscription to go to the pharmacy to get pills
0.960000	He knows more about medical conditions than I do. He has years of education in the medical field and I would only know what I can find in books, searching on medical websites for information and from asking other people about medical conditions.
0.600000	I don't have a primary Doctor. After recent experience with my Mom being hospitalized for and extended period of time, and fighting hard for her life, the doctors kept misdiagnosing her until it was too late. She passed away because of this, so I don't have much trust in doctors right now.

0.760000	My former physician has made the best decisions about my medical care based on the tests and my answers to his questions.
0.840000	"For my primary care physician I reserve time to meet with the doctor to discuss my health care plan to see if we can have a honest and open relationship in managing my health. I would not continue to see a physician that did not have time to discuss my health, ensure all my questions and concerns are addressed, and ever said to me ""you wouldn't understand or just do as I say"". Health care is a team effort between the patient, family members, and care Providers."
0.400000	She is too stuck in the allopathic medicine.  I'm about to fire my long term physician. She sometimes does not listen, and has to be forced to listen.

1.000000	I trust my doctor because they never give me a reason not to. They show me everything I need to know. They have a website where I can see all my medical records, what test they ran and how they I did on it. My doctor is the best!
1.000000	I have been seeing my doctor for about 15 years and continue to be impressed with his empathy and competence. He has been voted one of the top Internists in our city year after year and he is very well respected in the medical community.
0.640000	I think the vast majority of doctors have the patient's best interests at heart, but occasionally they may push for a certain treatment or medication for political reasons.

0.560000	I have a personal care physician that generally is interested in the problem and is willing to offer suggestions or solutions,  For the most part I simply go to the doctor about every 3 months for her opinion if I need to do anything in particular.

0.840000	In 2013 I moved and got a new primary care doctor.  Within a three month period I broke 4 bones in my foot and had to be hospitalized for a severe intestinal problem.  My doctor took the time to explain all options to me and followed up with me to make sure I was doing well.

0.600000	I have a very good connection with my healthcare provider. I trust him very much. i am not worried at all.
0.680000	I trust my doctor for the most part, however I don't think doctors know everything and they should really listen to their patients views and opinions when it comes to their health and what their body is telling them. 
0.600000	Well I do not have a specific primary care physician, so as far as having a level of trust or distrust for one, it is not possible.
0.800000	I know my doctor well, and have considerable experience with him and his methods.I trust him to keep me informed about my health issues.
0.680000	I generally trust my doctor. He, unlike many doctors, is actually interested in what he does. He is still human, and I challenge him when I feel the need. He doesn't mind, it makes him think.
0.760000	I have a genuine trust in doctors for the simple fact a doctor's isn't afforded mistakes. If a health care provider makes an occupational they could possibly be subjected to legal ramifications.
0.600000	I trust my doctor mostly but sometimes she can seem a little cocky. That concerns me because she doesn't think she is capable of mistakes.
0.720000	He has been my physician for several years.  I have never had a problem with his treatment plans.  He is willing to bring in a specialist when it is warranted.  I am confident in his care.
0.600000	I  prefer to research on my own but you in general need to trust primary care physician and believe that he is doing good for you
0.600000	I have only seen my current physicians once or twice.  All of my long time physicians have retired from practice and I now have no physician that I've known, or been treated by, for a length of time.  
0.480000	I don't know her well yet, and I've only seen her three times. Also, I prefer natural medicine when possible, which medical doctors tend to stay away from. 
0.680000	I trust that my primary care physician will provide me with the accurate info regarding my well being in regards with what's diagnosed.
0.720000	My doctor comes to my home for our visits because i can talk with her in a more friendly atmosphere then an office visit Which i feel i get to know her better and able to trust her more 
0.840000	he has always let me to kake right choices I have never had a reason to not trust him I have had him for a doctor for over thirty years still in about as good a shape as any year old man

0.720000	I trust my doctor because I know she has done this for many years. She's a professional and cares about each patient. 
0.880000	I trust the physicans i currently have because i have had positive experiences through the many years that i've been a loyal patient. And when issues arise they are always handled quickly and efficiently. 
0.440000	They are in and out seeing in real quick, prescribe a medicine that costs an arm and a leg and come back in 4-6 weeks. And rumor has it, the doctors get a kick back from drug companies for drugs they prescribe. And they also schedule 8-12 patients at once so all patients wait and wait some more, frustrating yes
0.680000	I believe we are all humans and humans make mistakes. So, although I trust my doctor they are not perfect.
0.640000	he is very free and open to talk to me about just anything I may ask, has my best interests at heart
0.720000	It's never occurred to me not to trust her. She seems to explain things well. I don't know how to expand on this answer - it's never something I've thought about before. 
1.000000	shes friendly an nice to me an all her patients she does what is best for me  an i trust her a lot  we get along great 
0.920000	The main reason I trust my doctor is that I have been going to him for many years for yearly check ups and other medical attention and over time I have discovered that his diagnosis is generally correct and that he has my best interests at heart. 
1.000000	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because he really looks out for my well being he understands that I have a 6 year old and he wants me to be around until she is grown.
0.800000	My Doctor is from our community and goes to our local church. She has a daughter also that is one of our best EMTs locally. She also doesn't care about if you can pay her right away. 
0.520000	Too many doctors who practice western style medicine are not willing to accept the benefits traditional Chinese medicine, like acupuncture and herbs. 
0.920000	My primary care physician has been very good for me and too me. I have been going to her since my last doctor retired. The doctors that she refer me to are the one's that she trust with the care of her family members and herself. She is also an affiliate in one of the best hospitals in my area.
0.600000	I don't go to the doctor often and have no medical condition. I don't have a doctor I see regularly for anything so I don't really have anything to base an answer off of.
0.600000	I do not have a primary physician, however I rely on my sister, who is a physician, for all things medical. I don't always follow her advice, but I do listen and ask the appropriate questions before making my own decisions. However, I know many, many doctors and don't trust a great deal of them to have the patient's best interest at heart. Sometimes they are lazy. Sometimes they are condescending. Sometimes the amount of money they'll receive from the patient's insurance/pockets matters the most.
0.520000	Sometimes I feel like my primary care physician only wants to hurry up and move onto the next patient.
0.800000	"I do believe in being informed, myself, but at the end of the day, for some things, one has to trust an ""expert"" - I feel that picking a doctor is hard. But once you have picked a doctor you feel you can trust, then you should trust them."
0.920000	i trust them because I have known them for a long time and they have done very well by me, he listens to me and lets me talk and give my opinions
0.600000	He seems like  a  good  person  hope  I can  keep  this one longer then a year  I hope  all goes  well  with  this  doctor  
0.440000	because they just  care about how much money they can get from I have had to make the decision for like chorlesterol meds
1.000000	If I didn't have trust in my physician I'd find one I do trust.  This is somewhat of an absurd question.  My physician ALWAYS explains things, is upfront, takes necessary time and explains everything 
0.520000	i know how doctors get kick backs for prescribing certain medications and although I do like my doctor, I still don't trust that they always have my best interests in mind. 
0.600000	I do trust my doctor but not doctors in general. Many are only looking after themselves and do not have the patient's best interest at heart. I will not stay with a doctor I think is doing that.
0.720000	They are there to do a job and I think doctors want to help so they always try to do their best and sometimes they are wrong you have to look to yourself to help too
0.800000	i have known him for a long time and he is honest and dependable to a fault.  he is always clear and concise in his diagnoses and instructions for treatment.
0.680000	I have not seen my PCP very often as I switched about 1 1/2 years ago and mainly have the need to see specialists.  When I have seen my PCP I feel he cared and did what he felt best and was honest with me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. I have never had a problem. They have always been nice and made me feel comfortable. 
0.600000	I trust the knowledge that doctors have to identify a problem and provide solutions, but I distrust the use/prescription of medications when they aren't necessary to solve the issue.
0.520000	My Father was killed by is Dr.  My Mother was killed by a Hospital.  Dr's in America are trained to prescribe Pills, not cure the ill.  I have a primary care physician, but I take charge of my health.  I am 70 years old and take no prescription drugs.
0.960000	My doctor is very conscientious.  He asks me a lot of questions to get to why I feel the way I do.  He is very empathetic.  
0.920000	He takes the time to listen to me.  I am comfortable talking to him and he answers any questions in a senseable way. He also suggests more economical a alternative options instead of just drugs. 
0.360000	They are always rushing and not receptive to questions.  They seem to be overbooking for the money.  I think ultimately it's my responsibility to take care of myself so I don't blame them in my mind.
0.600000	I am neutral on how I feel about trusting my Doctor. I will listen and use my common sense or go with my gut feeling and/or research more on my own.
1.000000	I have been going to him for many years and he has always been right about his diagnosis. If he does not know the answer to something then he will recommend I go to a specialist.
0.920000	my doctor is up on everything as he goes to conference. He also knows pharmacolical answersMy daughter who is the hospital CFO recommended him.
0.680000	My doctor is great he listens to me and my needs.  Along with his nurses and communicated very well with my concerns.
0.920000	i have faith in my dr.i've been seeing her for a long time & believe she has done a good job at keeping me well and healthy. she is up on all of the latest medical problems and treatments. i feel safe in her hands
1.000000	i do trust my doctor to tell me about my health an what better I can do to help myself an the things I should do
0.760000	My doctor doesnt seem to be quick to prescribe medication, answers all my questions, is calm, doesnt seem to be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. Makes me feel confident in his ability.  
0.880000	I have went to the same doctor for a number of years and he has always listens to the questions I have. For example, if I need additional blood work or tests, he explains why this is necessary and what he is looking for. I trust his judgment and am appreciative of his care and concern.
1.000000	I like my doctor and trust him, he is caring and thoughtful of me and my needs I would not change doctors, I will continue seeing him
0.680000	Have only seen him 2x but he seems nice and  seemed to know what he he doing, more than willing to,set up appointments for me with other hwpealthcare specialists
1.000000	Been with my doctor for many years. When he thought something on my leg looked like could be skin cancer, he didn't wait, he called a dermatologist right away and sent me right over to have it checked.  Sure enough it was skin cancer.
0.960000	I have had many Drs over the years, I have 3 right now, and I trust them all very much. They talk to me about what is being done or what I should do to do better. 
0.520000	My Dr. really cares for her patients. She is wonderful. If you have an issue, she will give you a list of specialists and tell you, which one you should go. he is very professional.
0.920000	He is the professional with access to studies regarding medications and illnesses.  If I didn't trust in him, then do not know where I would turn.
0.720000	"First, I want to say that it's very hard to rate the sentence ""all in all you have complete trust in your doctor"" on a sliding scale. The sentence contains an absolute, so it's not clear. Next, to sum up how much I trust my doctor, I'd say I generally trust her, and I think that she's a competent person with good intentions, but that she also has a reasonable amount of self-interest and might not be above soft-selling me something I don't really need, like botox. I don't think that she would lie to me about it, though. She has a fairly conservative point of view about prescribing medications and I appreciate that."
0.840000	we have built a relationship, he knows what we desire and expect and all live up to the exceptions we have set
0.960000	I trust my doctor with my healthcare needs because of his knowledge, compassion and care for my well being.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because I've been with him for years, and through those years, I've become healthier and happier by following his advice. I was overweight and unhealthy just a couple years back, and because of a healthy routine prescribed by my doctor, I've shed pounds and am much healthier today.
1.000000	She has been my doctor for years. She is older and has been a doctor for years. I basically like how she conducts an examination. 
0.760000	my doctors always explain all the side effects of all the different medications that are planned to be taken by me and they will answer all questions i have to the best of there nowledge
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician's knowledge, in that has been able to direct me in the right path of medical care for several years. She has directed me to specialists whom I have found to be great doctors. She is very knowledgeable--a specialist, in fact--in the area of breast cancer, which is of special concern to me because of my family history. She takes plenty of time to ask and answer questions at each visit.
0.960000	He is a kind, compassionate man who always takes time to explain in detail what should be done and how it will be done. He always takes time to explain everything in detail.
0.560000	I do not have complete trust  or distrust for doctors but I feel most are more about making a buck than they are about caring for their patients.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor - overwise I would have change my doctor immediately. No reason to visit doctor I cannot trust.
0.480000	Doctors have operated on me and have messed their operations,therefore,I do not have much trust in doctors !!!
0.520000	too busy and they can't be bothered to sit actually listen to what you have to say. your just a number to them
1.000000	He has been my doctor through cancer and other maladies for 20 years. He is very modest and gentle. He has found problems with my health that I was not aware of, such as pneumonia.
0.640000	I trust my primary care doctor. I have been with the same person for 4years and she is very knowledgeable and always on point with treatment and what to do
0.600000	i like my doctor but sometimes i just do not know what to think about things they have help out a lot over the years
0.560000	I have general trust as he has been working for many years and has usually fixed my ailments. However, I do feel that he is getting lazier as he nears retirement and sometimes wonder if he suggests medications due to relationships he has with pharmaceutical companies.
0.640000	sometimes I think they take things out of control because everyone body is different and sometimes the things they said we should be taking it ends up making us worst or bad 
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for 28 years he has never steered mee wrong  I haav aalwa trusted him to do what is right for me and he has never let me down.  Always  on my side not his.
0.640000	Sometimes physicians give unnecessary treatment and sometimes they are on point with treatment with my personal experience I always recommend a second opinion 
0.480000	My primary care doctor works for the Dept Of Veterans Affairs, I truly believe he has the best interest of the VA not me.
0.800000	I trust him because he has been one of my doctor's for 15 years and knows my medical history. He bases decisions on my history.
0.880000	I have some very negative experiences with doctors trying to treat beyond their personal capabilities. My current doctor is great at discussing the problem, and if he does not feel totally confident in a procedure or treatment, I get a referral to a specialist. I love it.
0.760000	I trust my Dr because she is very honest with me. She tells me what she thinks is the best situation for me regarding my diabetes. We also talk about family. I know she is married to another Dr, and they have 2 boys. I broke my fibula last year, and she was very honest with me regarding the healing process with my leg. I took about 10 months to heal, and I sometimes still have pain. She told me I will probably have pain on and off for the rest of my life. diabetes and my age are factors in the slow healing.
0.680000	I trust him enough to provide me with the information I need to make a decision - as to agreeing with what he thinks is best for me, I am neutral.  I make my own decision after speaking with those that are close to me.
0.600000	I trust him but there is always that doubt that they are just guessing your diagnosed things because they are doctor
0.480000	Most doctors are either trying to make money or don't take the time to fix the problem. They rely on medications to make the patient feel comfortable while making him or her more sick. 
0.520000	Doctors tell you what is good for them financially. They may have stock in a certain type of medicine so they prescribe that medicine more often. It's always best to get a second or third opinion.
0.800000	Well let's see. So far my Doctor hasn't led me astray yet. He has told me to lose some weight, but I think he knows that isn't going to happen anytime soon. When we have a problem, he is willing to work on it to figure out what is going on.
0.800000	i have been with my primary care doctor for over 5 years. i trust her and i feel that i have a good means of communication wuith her plus she always takes the time to sit with me and explain any issues i may have
0.600000	I trust my doctor she listens to my feelings & also listens to me regarding my concerns about certain medications 
0.680000	i trust him we are from a small town and see him al the time. he always ask how we are doing and remembers everything
0.600000	I really have no reason not to trust my physican or my doctor in general. They are all comptent medical professionals
0.680000	I believe that my primary care physician has my best health thoughts in mind and would not lead me in a direction that would be bad for me
0.600000	She used to be an excellent doctor. Not so much as her practice has expanded. Now she seems to take longer and longer extended vacations.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician, but sometimes I don't feel like we could do be everything that we should be doing to make me feel better.
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because she is very kind and compassionate and always discusses all treatment options to understand what is best for me.
0.520000	I feel like a couple of health issues that I have had to deal with have been belittled or downplayed when talking to my doctor
0.800000	my  primary care physician always show interest in my concerns and totally honest in telling me about all of the different treatment options available for my condition. All in all, i completely trust my doctor's decisions on which medical treatments are best for me.
0.800000	I think he's looking out for my best interest. Checks thourough an yet d doesn't do excess. Just the right amount
0.760000	I trust the doctors I have seen because they have spent time listening to me and fully answering my questions.
0.760000	My new doctors seem to be very knowledgeable and intent upon learning all about me. I am not too sure if I agree with the judgement that I should stop taking metformin (which I have been taking for over 12 years) because I am over medicating because my A1C is below 7 (6.2) and they seem more worried about my blood pressure than anything else.
0.560000	I think they are more into there own money earning then into really helpping me out with my needs. They do help in the way they tell me but with the other needs I need I have to find out my own information since they dont offer it and I think they should give that information also
0.680000	I trust doctors in general because I believe in the Hippocratic oath and I haven't had a negative experience that would make me distrust them. There are cases (specifically scheduled c-sections) that I think are about convenience, but for the most part, doctors are trustworthy. 
0.240000	Over the years the doctors have done vary little to help with my disease other than take my money, give me medication that does nothing or makes me feel worse, or give me no hope at all. I have been able to do much more for myself than any doctor has
0.840000	I have spent a lot of time over the years finding a woman's doctor oh finally on the third doctor in about six years I found a doctor that I really like. I trust her a lot and I believe that she gives me her honest opinion on things,  she will leave and go out of her way to tell me practices that used to be performed which are as widely practiced anymore. Myother main doctor is for my sleep condition. I've been going to see him for over year and I trust his guidance as well. 
0.800000	I have a god relationship with all of my doctors.  They always take as much time with me as necessary
0.960000	I fully trust my physician, I've been going to him for years! He is thorough during my visits, he tries treating disorders/illnesses/conditions without medication first, then if that doesn't work he will prescribe medication. He is totally honest and informative!
0.840000	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and to listen to me. She asks me questions pertaining to the situation and is thorough in explaining what her opinion is. 
0.800000	There is a high level of mutual respect and regard between my medical team and me.  We all recognize that honest, complete  commucation is essential for them to provide me with the best care.  If I question a particular treatment, they are completely willing to discuss the pros, cons, and options for the optimal outcome.
0.840000	My doctor is kind and very well informed.  He always takes the time to explain things to me carefully and has literature to support his positions.  He takes my opinions into account and doesn't ever denigrate my own research.  It's a great partnering relationship.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he has never done me wrong. My old doctor was and old arrogant man that was not sympathetic to my problems and concerns so I know a good doctor when I get one.
0.840000	Just general anxiety from test results. The people I deal with are all very good and do all they can to make me more relaxed. 
0.760000	He has never given me any bad advice. He has helped me through several situations. I do trust him and do as he recommends.

0.760000	I am somewhat distrustful because of a misdiagnose of one of my children in childhood. It delayed his recovery and caused hospitalization that was not necessary.  I believe you have to be your own advocate.
0.560000	In general most practitioners do a good job, some spend more time with you and some it's different each time you visit. Some make you feel like they are guessing while others give you assurance they know exactly what to do. 
0.360000	I think that I'm just a number and he just wants to me get in and out as soon as possible. I don't think that he really cares about me at all and I'm just a paycheck
0.960000	She maybe be running behind but she never acts like she  is rushing through my appointments.Take the time to answer questions and explain the best treatment for me.  
0.840000	I trust them because they are here to help us all not hurt us and for the better being of our lifes always in a positive way of life always.
0.520000	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I have had a couple of bad experiences with doctors in the past.  Doctors are humans and humans make mistakes.  My last primary care physician didn't listen to my daughters symptoms and the next day, she was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis.  I never went back to him .  (She won't either. )
0.600000	Sometimes I feel that certain doctors are only in it to make the bucks not to look at the person's health as a whole. 
0.720000	My Doctor has a degree and knows what he is doing , When he is doing surgery on me he is in control I am a sleep and give him all my trust. When he orders medication I trust him to do whats right

0.840000	I trust my physician because he or she knows the best in health and will tell their opinion based on knowledge.
1.000000	I've been to many doctors but my current Doctor is very nice and explains everything in a Manor I can understand and is always on time and doesn't keep me waiting
1.000000	I have been with my current primary care physician for over 10 years.  She knows me as well as my family.  She explains things if I don't understand.  She listens when I have concerns.  I trust my physician to provide care that is best for me.
0.800000	They tell me the things that I have to do and not to do to be healthy. They don't beat around the bush, they tell me if something is wrong with me.
0.960000	I haven't had any problems with following instructions from any of them for the last five years,and I've had a few medical procedures done.
0.760000	I think doctors usually try to give the best care possible, although sometimes there may be other options available.
0.560000	My doctor is a good doctor but rather conventional and not always open to some of my suggestions.  I am very chronically ill and in constant pain but he refuses to allow me to use medicinal cannabis although it is legal in my state.
0.600000	I trust my priamary care because I have seen her for many years and has always taken good care of me
0.720000	I believe I bring with me an army of negative people.  It has been this way for over ten years.  Without me these people get nothing.  It is difficult for me to focus on my life when so much of it revolves around other people.  Of course the only evidence to me is going from a grade a student to homeless and unemployed.  Like I set that goal for myself.  I find life gives me the opposite of what I ask for.  However due to current small successes I am beginning to change my opinion and that I believe will also change my homelessness.  That being said people who set out to help me find they now become part of this negative crowd's aggressiveness.  Who to blame but me.  There is no evidence.  It's about a person's attitude and their true intentions.  I trust my helpers to make informed decisions according to their god given abilities and people given authorities.  The second amendment.  The fifth amendment.  To defend the first.
0.880000	I don't have any reason not to. My parents and a couple of my friends go to the same practice and I know they all like it there as well.

1.000000	I like my Dr he's between on this ride with me for8 years,  he was there from day one.  He's had been great he's never in a rush nor in a hurry to leave.  He listens to what I have to say
0.520000	I trust my primary care doctor.  I know enough to keep myself and others safe.  He is somewhat lackluster in touching and doing needed tests.
0.760000	Doctors can be trusted but sometimes I feel they prescribe medications because they get a kickback whenever a patient buys a prescription for a medication they have written a prescription for. I feel that there are alternative solutions for some medical problems that will work just as well.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she went to school for a very  long time and she knows alot more then I know about anything

0.640000	I use tricare on a Air Force Base. The primary Docs rotate. I have really liked and trusted my last 2 Doctors but the one I have now, not so much.
0.560000	I recognize that doctors have bad days or hold onto rigid views.  At the same time, I admire their minds and dedication. I trust my own views more than a doctor's about some things, e.g., nutrition.  But when it comes to serious illness, I would listen to their recommendations and take them under advisement.
0.680000	she's good at most stuff but doesn't believe that certain conditions exist or that treatment not conventional would be helpful.  but she does listen pretty well and has quickly diagnosed some critical problems so she's a keeper.
0.960000	She has been very thorough and asks questions about me personally we have a good relationship she checks me out 
0.800000	I have not seen a doctor in 8 years.I feel stress often but after seeing what kind of stress they go through,I will take on my own issues.
0.760000	The doctor does his best but must be a good listener and read between the words to understand me and be a good judge of what will work a long time.
0.400000	"He is often in a hurry to get to the next patient and does a poor job of explaining my condition/medication and shows no sympathy.  Just because someone is a ""doctor"" does not mean they are any good.  "
0.520000	my doctor does not tell me choices I need to figure out the options that I can choose from.  I have side effects
0.840000	My doctor is pretty thorough in treatment options. She sat with me for 30 minutes discussing different types of medications I could take for a related health problem.
0.880000	I trust this person to provide me with the medications I need to live a long healthy life. Even though they may reccomend a more expensive option for their benefit.
0.840000	My primary physician always explains in great detail all information that I need to take care of any medical condition I might be having
0.560000	my primary care physician will tell me I need to take a drug instead of offering something natural to help me. I really try to avoid drugs. I don't completly trust that taking drugs is always the best answer
0.760000	I go to a DO rather than an MD. I think she looks at my health more holistically than a regular MD who looks for what they can prescribe to fix the problem. She asks about other things that may be impacting the issue rather than just writing an Rx.
1.000000	He seems to be aware of my ailments and is concerned that my treatment is correct. He is listening to me and my individual issues. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor in every way he treats me-with drugs that I need and the confidence I have in him in what we talk about
0.920000	My doctor listens to me, anything I'm concerned about. He helps me adjust basal rates on my pump, goes over test results and explains any I might be concerned about. He understood my resistance to getting an insulin pump at first when he suggested it. I had been battling breast cancer and had spent several months being operated on, reconstructed, poked, probed, had chemo pumped into my system and just needed a break . A year later I was ready to talk to him about it and he got me set up with one.
1.000000	he is a personal FRIEND OF MINE SO I KNOW HE ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTERESTS IN MIND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH HIM OR HIS STAFF
0.600000	I trust my primary doctor to a certain extent sometimes worry that they choose prescriptions thru firms that they get something from so push that companies pills
0.840000	"My doc. is a very caring and compassionate person, he gives my all the time I need to discuss questions and concerns I may have, he has great ""bedside manners"". He always takes an interest in me and my health."
0.960000	My Dr. and I converse quite easily and neither of us is shy nor adverse to talking about my health and habits whether good or bad.
0.640000	"I have little trust in anyone. When I ""trust"" it is because I believe it is possible for there to be a better nature of a situation and person, but I believe for the most part people are liars, or truth benders, or they just don't say everything they should, even if they don't lie. It is complicated. All I know is that I do not fully trust anyone, well... I kinda... it is complicated. Anytime I fully opened up to someone and let my guard down they crushed me. So, I keep my guard up always, and trust so litle I barely trust myself, but I try to trust medical professionals as much as I can, I am getting better at it."
0.600000	"I know multiple cases of healthcare providers that pressure doctors to perform ""low risk"" treatments that have ultimately harmed their patient in the long run until     their insurance ran out. This is an issue with insurance companies, however the medical profession seems to be tied with them on some level."
0.800000	My current physician seems trustworthy and has given me good recommendations to improve my everyday health which have been working. 
0.720000	My doctor gives you options and lets you pick what is best for you. So if he said this is the only option I would most likely believe him. Plus he would probably refer me to a specialist. So I would have a second opinion with the specialist.
0.880000	Doctor is open, honest and explains all situations and answers my questions and concerns. Provides for all necessary tests and labs
0.720000	They have been my primary care doctor for years.  My doctor is careing and usually takes time to listen to me.  She has been able to help me with most problems and trusts me as a patient.  She also has been a doctor to most of my family for years and knows my history.
0.880000	While I am intelligent and know what is best for me and my lifestyle,  I value her education and experience in the health care system. 
0.680000	i trust as i use the primary care physican for years and my family has as well. a stellar reputation in the area . Plus the hospita affilation is strong with good rep there as well
0.880000	I have used the same PCP for many years. He cares about his patients and researches each out of the ordinary problem and comes up with the best answer.
0.840000	My dr sits down and goes into detail answering my question and explaining any new medication she is giving me.
0.960000	Because me and my doctor are able to go over every ingient so I will have a better understanding what each one does
0.680000	"I usually trust certain doctors depending on howe well they listen to me, but doctors who talk over me make me mad. My GP she patronizes me and its sooooo aggrevating. She wil also say, ""Im not your mama, so you should be doing this or thta but Im not your mama.....Im like ..look lady my mama is dead, so can you please stop bringing that up everytime I see you? She is a terrible doctor."
0.760000	My doctor has always taken the necessary time to go over any questions or concerns I may have, even if that meant she was going into her next scheduled appointment late
0.840000	My doctor takes her time when I am there as though I am her only patient.  She asks questions and she makes sure she understand my symptoms and concerns.
0.800000	I have been seeing the same doctor for 15 years.  I find him very trustworthy and have never had a problem with anything he has said.
0.680000	I begin researching and then trusting. I rely on their experience and track record. I consider my visits and then form an opinion.
0.560000	His office is extremely busy, seeing patients every 15 min. or so.  So times I don't feel we've solved a particular issue I'm having.  They are also very lax at getting  paperwork done in a timely manner sometimes...I feel like I need to stay on top of things there.
0.480000	I really don't put a lot of trust in doctors as there are many who will prescribe medications that may not be necessary in order to get the bonuses drug companies offer to promote their drugs.  I prefer doctors that will consider alternative or natural medication
0.760000	When I don't feel the doctor listens or is willing to explain I get another doctor.  My current doctor listens, answers questions and looks into my concerns.  We communicate by email and he is always certain to get back to me quickly.
0.680000	HE LISTENS TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING MY TYPE 2 DIABETES OR OTHER CONDITION I MAY HAVE.  IF I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING HE SAYS HE TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER THEM RATHER THAN PUTTING ME OFF WITH A HALF ASSED ANSWER BUT RATHER GIVES A THOUGHTFUL ANSWER IN TERMS I CAN UNDERSTAND RATHER THEN SAYING THINGS I NEED A MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTAND.  THIS GOES FOR MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MY UROLOGIST AND MY ENDOCRONOLOGIST 
0.720000	I don't distrust my primary physician, he just doesn't completely understand how to handle my current condition. He tends to defer to my other doctors, who I don't trust much at all.

0.520000	My doctor is opened minded, listens, cares about my overall well being and want whats best for my health.
0.520000	i usually don't trust doctors in the hospitals close to me, since i don't have a personal physician. for some reason most doctors that i have interacted with in nyc always seem so distant and not caring of whats going on in your life, especially when it comes to your physical health
0.920000	She has always treated with respect. Explained her answers to questions I had about my health in terms I could understand
0.200000	Because they think they know everything and they dont. We are not at the brink of medical technology. They still dont have a cure for the common cold.
0.840000	In regards to Doctors in general, based on my families experience, they were very reliable.They benefited (my family) On the judgement of the Physicisn

0.840000	He listens to me, takes time to listen to my concerns and I feel like he tries to do the best he possibly can for my health problems.
0.960000	I just changed to a new doctor and she is very caring. She was very patient when I saw her for the first time. She took time to listen to my concerns and started an immediate plan of action. So far, her plan of action is working and I'm starting to feel better.
0.320000	I think he's just motivated by the dollar. Doesn't care if I die, just wants to prescribe me items that he gets a kickback on.
0.800000	I just started to see my new doctor & hadn't been to a doctor in a # of years, but she seems very thorough about testing me for almost everything.
0.640000	I trust my doctor 0n most matters, but I feel sometimes I have to insist on being involved in my own care, and to make sure I get full answers to any concerns I have.  I do not like arrogant doctors.

0.800000	There is no reason to not be honest about any conditions. I see a physician once a year and take no medications, so there's nothing much to tell.
0.560000	Don't have a primary physician at the time. Don't take the time to really know me and what have led to any problems I am now experiencing.
0.880000	Have had the same doctor for 20+ years. Always has been on the ball. Good with reminders and any updates.
0.560000	She seems overburdened, yawns a lot during our visit. I'm just not sure that she's all that engaged. Does spend a good amount of time and is very nice. Just not sure how much she really gets done though
0.640000	Doctors know more than the low class so they are going to organize and make references to medical advice based on the economy and budget.
0.800000	My doctor always takes time with me and ask my feelings towards things. They have never misguided me and always seem to have my best interest in mind.

0.600000	I trust my doctor, but i trust myself more. I know me and what's right for me better than my doctor does. 
0.560000	I have only had my PCP for  a short time so we are still in the trust building stage - more to be determined after further diagnosis and treatments.
0.640000	I hardly ever see a doctor because my health  clinic has mostly nurse practitioners.  I do trust their judgement but they don't have the experience and training that doctor's have.  When I ask to see a specialist it very seldom happens unless I keep asking.  In conclusion I trust my nurse practitioner in general but would like to see a doctor sometimes.

0.800000	I trust my doctor as he has never led me wrong, He listens to me and isn't showing me the door for his next patient..within reason of course...He has been my primary care Doctor for 8 yrs. and he's the best one I have ever had...

1.000000	"Since my first visit, post-diagnosis, my Oncologist has taken the time to thoroughly explain all treatment options, along with the associated benefits and side effects.  He advises which treatment course he recommends and then discusses any questions for concerns I may have.  I am now 8 months past what I like to call my ""expiration date"" of 7 - 14 months life expectancy, on my second treatment option and controlling side effects efficiently with minimal use of additional pharmaceuticals, as my wish s to control my cancer with as few chemicals as absolutely necessary and my Oncologist completely supports that as my choice."

0.760000	I trust my primary care physician. She is very knowledgeable about a lot of conditions.

0.800000	My doctor is very good.  He kind of reminds me of the 'old fashioned' type who would actually take on your health care.  I know that I still must stay tuned to my body and it's needs it's just nice having someone like Dr. Kang who takes it seriously.
0.600000	Doctors really don't spend much time with you then they always send you to the lab for everything when at times a lab report is just another waste of time 
0.960000	My doctor takes a good deal of time to sit with me, answer my questions and advise me about courses of treatment when necessary. She has not steered me wrong in any of my medical issues.
0.600000	I like how my doctor treat me. And when I ask him for something he does it. And I don't have to wait when I need things.

0.560000	He always refers me out to specialists/it seems he is reserved about making some decisions about my health issues
0.960000	My physician is also a family friend. He has proven his trustworthiness by taking extra time when I have a visit to the office. He answers all my questions and concerns.
0.280000	I have worked with doctors for years, they are people with problems and attitudes and unrealistic goals also.  MY OBgyn is useless.

1.000000	my docter is very good at what she does. she knows exactly how to treat me. and what I need to do to stay healthy.

0.800000	My doctors and dentist are honest and trustworthy.  I have been going to them for a long time and find them to be interested in my health and they have always been receptive to answering my questions and concerns.
0.640000	I'm unsure how I feel about my physician because I rarely see her. I trust her to give me good advice because that is her job.
0.200000	The reason I do not have trust in my doctor is because they rush through the appointment becaus ehe more peopla see means more money they make. The quality is poor.
0.480000	"I have had the same primary care physician for over ten years now, and he has slowly been losing my trust over the years. I have seen him often over the years and have grown tired of him telling me he can make me feel better or that I will be back to my ""old self"" soon. It never happens. I don't trust that he knows how to help me. "
0.720000	I've been going to the same health care provider for many years. I am very satisfied with my health care. I will most likely be there for the duration
0.600000	the doctor i last saw is no longer working in the doctor's office I go to so I don't know how I would answer this question.
0.720000	they do not make money of of me not coming back. they need to know i will come back. they took an oath to help people and do what is right
0.840000	the last dr. i had was nice but she left but i'm supposed to have another woman dr. i think that is a plus for me.the former dr. listened and spent time with me and was on time.
0.600000	at times I feel I am not being heard and the appointments are rushed and then other times I feel like I am being referred to other doctors to have tests possibly done, when my prmary care doctor could just order the test
0.760000	He takes the time to listen and then to explain. He asks me questions to understand me and is most often correct.
1.000000	I have been with  my primacy care physician for 14 years.  He has been with me every step of the way during my cancer surgery and treatments and has shown a great depth of interest in my well being.  He was very understanding and compassionate during that time and extremely helpful as always.
0.840000	She hasn't stirred me wrong as yet, I feel confident in her abilities to what is right for me. I trust my Doctor very much.

0.200000	I have been misdiaganosied a few times. I had a stroke and was told go home and rest it was a pinched nerve. My doctor does not listen well and does not trust I know my own body. I have been told many times I dont have something like kidney stones and after tests confirmed that i do.
0.720000	I do not generally trust or distrust people, doctors included.  It depends on the individual doctor, the condition/issue, the degree to which that professional is (or is not) already behind schedule, on overload, in a hurry, worried, etc.  They are human, after all.  My doctor is quite thorough; in part I suspect it is her way of assuring she stays on track and covers everything though it sometimes seems to be at a cost to whatever my particular agenda might be during a given visit.  We have worked it out that she does her routine questions and I bring a list of my issues, so both of us has time.  This seems to be effective, though it would be wasted in a rotating medico situation where one did not see the same physician regularly.
0.640000	I generally trust my primary care physician yet I realize that any final decisions about my health (including treatments, medicines, etc.) are my choice to make.  Doctors are there to help the patients, give them advice, and so forth.  It is up to the patient to also rely on him or herself for health care.
0.400000	I don't trust most doctors. They just see you for like maybe 5 minutes and then get rid of you with meds.
0.680000	I trust my doctor to help me make decisions in regards to my emotional health and physical health. I am comfortable asking questions about things.
1.000000	my doctor always takes the time to explain all  my options to me all what happens with each option  he is very patient with me and my questions
0.520000	My doctor seems to want to help treat patients but applies his personal beliefs too often and wants me to mentally overcome certain aliments or rely on God.
0.600000	I don't have a primary doctor so these don't really apply to me personally. I think a primary care doctor is more reliable than an error doctor because they're less rushed and spend more one on one time with patients
0.800000	When I was recently seriously ill, he figured out what was wrong and gave me several solutions and suggestions. When I follow his orders, I feel great.
1.000000	My pPCPis a good person and I trust her.  She is interested in me personally, I can tell, and takes her time when I am with her.  My gut feeling is always good about her.  I'm glad I found her as my PCP.
0.800000	I trust my physician. He encourages questions and respects my preference for natural alternatives to prescribed services.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he gets very personal and not just all about the work. He actually makes time to have regular conversations to make you comfortable 
0.760000	Doctors have expertise in field of medicine, have completed training, and continue to train when new science is applicable, where I on the other hand do not have any experience in the medical field. 
0.480000	My dr only cares about getting out of your room and on to the next person. I am looking for a new dr. At the moment.
0.760000	this is part of a doctor's education and the Hippocratic oath, the only problem I have in trust is when insurance circumstances limit what's open or if the doctor doesn't seem to be aware of costs (this has not happened for some time)
0.920000	They have the knowledge and understand the best course of treatment for whatever is medically wrong with me.
0.960000	I have know my primary care physician for a long time and have the utmost trust in him in treating all my health issues. 
0.640000	Because they are all about getting as much money as possible. And getting as many patients in and out quick as possible.
0.920000	I have always felt my doctor has been totally open and honest with me.  I have never felt rushed.  I feel like I can tell her anything and will get an truthful answer back.
0.600000	I don't know him very well yet, but I think he will be a good fit to handle my complex medical needs.
0.840000	they dont listen to what you try to tell them, when you try to tell them how you feel and what meds you need they dont wanna try to make you feel better
0.720000	I trust them and they usuallt have my best interest at heart... i love doctors and believe they gerenally are good and have my best interest at heart
0.400000	My PCP only takes 5 minutes with me, asks me a couple of questions, fills out a prescription slip and quickly leaves the room. I do not feel she is acting in my best interests, and she does not listen to me. I react very badly to most manufactured pharmaceuticals, my doctor knows this and keeps trying to insist I try newer meds. Every single time I switch doctors they want to try this. I flatly refuse as I know how ill they will make me. My attitude is... if it's not broken, don't fix it!  I have met very few doctors that actually take the time to listen and really HEAR what I am saying. All I want is a diagnosis and I will treat myself with natural remedies, if possible.  
0.760000	My rheumatologist is the doctor that I trust the most. He is very knowledgeable and it is obvious that he cares about his patients. He actually save my mother's life at one point because he recognized that she had a rare condition that the other doctors had not seen before. He is very honest about treatments, side effects and possible outcomes and works very hard to find the right treatment for the individual patient.
0.200000	kickbacks, bribes, drug deals, side effects, over booking, arrogant about their importance, believe their own lies hate it when others done.  do not care for clients health because when they are healthy doctors and hospitals, insurance companies and drug companies do not make money from them
0.240000	They don't know anything about real health.  They mostly just make decisions based on money and convenience.
0.840000	has always been to the point and forth rite in dealing with me in all of my health concerns even now that I have a rare terminal condition
0.720000	At times I feel I can trust doctors but there have been times that I have been uncertain with a few doctors.
0.440000	There have been times where I left the doctor's office without a diagnosis, without any assistance in dealing with my medical issue.  When I went for a lower back pain, I left with instruction to drink lots of water, but no indication to go for physical therapy, which is what I needed.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because he has be caring for our family for over 30 years. we have had numerous family members goto see him and they all have had great experiences with him.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they discuss every aspect of my health with me. They also answer any questions I may have. 
0.600000	I might trust them if they seem professional enough. But might not if they wind up  telling me or doing something to me that might not help me.
0.760000	All the times I have visited a doctor or had an exam or even surgery I was always treated with respect, I asked many questions, sometimes the same questions multiple times and I always got the same answer and was not steered wrong. Rarely have I had a disagreement with a doctor .
0.600000	been dealing with my doctor for along time trust what she says                                                        
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician, but have no problem with trusting a doctor with my care, as I have in the past.
0.520000	He doesn't really listen to my concerns or questions, only wants to blow it off like it is nothing. i have to repeat my self a lot
0.800000	I feel that with all his training and years of practice he does know what is best for me and tries to help with any problems I may have.  Once in a while we don't agree but can work something out that we can both agree upon.
1.000000	I trust my dry. Because I have had to have treatments of plasma 3 times a week for 4 weeks and 4 treatments of MeMO have been made better by listening to him and the treatments he suggested.
0.600000	I think a doctor will do the best that they can do for someone or the best that a person will let the doctor do
0.600000	I don't really have a relationship with my Primary Care Physician. I probably would mostly trust. I respect their knowledge.
0.520000	They are pressured by time to see the next patient. They have limitations from keeping up with every change in science and medicines. 
1.000000	He knows me, been a patient for years and never had a bad experience. He is kind, a Christian and I trust everything he says.
0.600000	Sometimes she will give quick fixes to a problem instead of finding a long-term answer or resolution.
0.800000	she has been taking care of me for 10 years and I trust her completely.  She always listens and helps me with whatever is going on
1.000000	He has been my Doctor, and my friend, for many years.  He was also my Mother and my husbands doctor.  I also knew him when he was a resident at the hospital that I worked at when he came to my floor as a student
0.680000	He's done well with me.. But as I watch my mom begin Alzheimer's my belief in our doctor is dying. He did a test but she passed. It was picking up a piece of paper off the floor.. hmmmmm I know it might be hard to detect... but Doctors should know more about this problem.  
0.800000	doctors have the education that is why it is not easy to become one. all the classes you have to complete.

0.800000	They're licensed. They know what will be best for you in terms of the medical field. They studied medicine for years compared to you that probably did not hence, why you are consulting a doctor.
0.680000	She listens to my needs and trys to get to the root of the problem and orders tes%s if applicable and she if affiliated with the neareat hospital
0.760000	I do not distrust my primary care physician. I have no reason not to trust her by any means. I trust her completely. 
0.840000	She will spend as much time as necessary with all her patients, so you dont mind the wait, because she listens to all your concerns and will suggest a specialist for anythig out of hr expertise.

0.680000	I don't currently have any health issues so there would be no reason for me to not to trust my doctor.
0.920000	They have always taken great care of me & my family. My doctor has been in the family for several generations. He knows our history very well.
0.520000	I don't have a primary care doctor. Why not? Because I basically don't trust them, they did no good for my mom, told her it was all in her head. She had MS
0.800000	I trust doctor she's very trusting and she's knows what my condition going to be and what medication to take and keep up to date with it
0.760000	This doctor now I have is new; so I don't know very well but my last primary care doctor; who just recently retired, always sat down with me and explained the pros and cons of each action he wanted me to take or not take.
0.320000	They do not listen to me and I feel that they really do not care to try to understand what I am trying to tell them.  It makes me feel like I am not making sense of what is happening to me. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she always gives a lot of choices and me which one is best for me
0.600000	trust because they should know what they are doing in there field. if they don't then they don't need to be in the health field
0.760000	I have been with my doctor for over 13 years.  He has been with me from the worst (near death) to my health as of today.  I do have a complex medical history and he will check on the computer just to see if I was in the ER or Urgent Care and will follow up with me if needed.  I feel that my doctor is going far above his help for me.  And I really agree with that.  It is not always a happy road.  We may argue about some of the treatments, but we always come to an answer to the problem.  To me, that is a very big trust in my doctor.
0.760000	My doctor is real friendly & will answer all of my questions. She seems to really care about her patients.

0.840000	This is hard because my doctor of over twenty odd years recently retired. I have only seen my new doctor a couple of times. But she was recommended by my previous doctor, so my trust is heightened. I guess it is safe to say that in general, I trust all doctors to know what they are doing.
0.760000	he is totally trained and professional, educated about what he does and he does it well. Seems to care about my problems and researches everything  quite well and very thouroughly. Cares about me as a patient.
0.640000	I trust the doctor because she seems sincere.  She has a no waste time approach and although I think she is giving me the bum's rush at times, she has never been wrong in her prognosis.
0.400000	I do not have 100% trust in my doctor because she just sends my blood work in the mail & never explain how I can do better I have to figure it out on my own & when she give me prescriptions she never check my paper work to even see if it has something in it that I will have allergic reaction to it or not.
0.680000	My GP is relatively new to the practice, so I have not had to see her very often, thus cannot rate her as totally trustworthy.  My encounters have been productive and useful.
0.840000	Sometimes I don't think he tells me everything I should know. It seems the doctor knows everything about you but is unwilling to tell you what he knows. The seem to hide your charts from you and sometimes never tell you your blood pressure or really how you are doing.
0.800000	My doctor has always been honest with me and he is very humble. If he doesn't know what's wrong, he will say so and have another doctor come in for a second opinion.

0.720000	I trust my doctors but you always need to have common sense when it is about your heath. I just don't take what they say ad not do any research on my own.
0.520000	Sometimes they are very dismissive of me and my concerns but will only care when it is convenient for them
0.920000	Doctors are generally better educated and up to what's current in health care.  I have trusted my doctor for many years now.  He was the first one to recognize that I needed surgery.

0.800000	My doctor seems to care about me and my conditions. He does not rush through talking to me and actually listens to what I have to say. 
1.000000	"My internist is always honest with me about any tests or diagnoses he provides.  He tells me options with meds, testing, surgeries, etc, then gives me the choice of how to proceed.  He never ""talks down"" to me, and explains thoroughly. He keeps good track of my health, immunizations, mental health, medications and tests.  He follows up with me after most visits to see how I'm doing."

0.760000	My Doctor is so very busy that she has some helpers that see her patients. They are good at what they do I suppose, and it is easy to see them for an appointment. I do wonder if they know my health as well as my Doctor. 
0.760000	I knew that my physician was honest and caring when he called me at home to check on how I was doing. He is a straight talker - doesn't sugar coat anything but is still kind in delivery (even with unpleasant news). He never seems in a hurry to be done with an appointment. 
0.640000	"i think more than the majority of doctors care about their patients but that they are stretched in time needed to actually give the right amount of time to the care of a lot of situations and rushed. i have to trust in the doctors i have. some are better than others but the extent of what is needed to become a doctor entitles the doctor to depend on that trust and my giving it to him. if i knew what was wrong with me, i wouldn't need a doctor but i do know my body and what is going on in it and need to let him know so he knows where to start to ""fix"" me, and also follow his directions. it does make it hard to trust anyone that is in charge of your health and how you feel, live or die when they have not the time to really know their patients and sometimes therefore form clinical decisions that are not necessarily the best answer for them causing the patient to mistrust his doctor. i feel i have no trust but to try to or change doctors."
0.960000	We have known him for over 20 years and two wonderful children and he has never been wrong with us. We trust him with our lives and children
0.720000	I trust my doctor with my medical condition because I hope the know what they are doing and have the knowledge and tools to help me if I have test done or a sickness. If I have doubts or distrust than I will sure to make sure I get a different health provider or doctor
0.720000	They have experience but very alert of some doctors but mostly they are trustful and put their patients first 
0.960000	I have a long relationship with my doctor.  I have every confidence in her ability to research and diagnose conditions.  She is a very respected and knowledgeable phycisian
0.760000	Because if he doesn't come through with being honest, I will own him...I will sue him into oblivion, and I will have his medical license yanked.
0.920000	my primary care physician takes time to talk to me and helps me understand what the medications she prescribes are for and how they can help me. she seems to care about my health.
0.600000	I am neutral in regard to this question, for I at the present time do not possess a primary care physician.
0.720000	Doctors in general are trustworthy.  They spend a lot of time in school and in practice.  They see lots of different things that happen to people and gain knowledge from those experiences which they can draw on to diagnose ailments.
0.480000	I do trust most things she tells me, but feel she does not take the time to be thorough in her assessments. She always seems to be in a great hurry to be done with the exam.
0.640000	healthcare profession is doing the best that it can, the situation at times for them can be limiting and handcuff much of the industry.
0.760000	A primary care physician is something like an immediate or emergency physician. It is to which we go first and these doctors see the seriousness of the health problem
1.000000	I have been going to my doctor for the last 26 years.  He is a fabulous doctor and I trust him in every way!!
0.600000	I rely on my doctor to select what s/he thinks are the three best treatment options for me based on what s/he knows about me.  However, I expect her/him to review the pros and cons of each option, entertain my question/s and then let me pick the treatment that I think is best for me.  If my medical professional can not help me navigate that process then I do not trust him/her and would look for a new PCP.
0.440000	Doctors spend minimal time with their patients and don't devote honest care to them. They always seem really busy. 
0.600000	I do not really have a doctor.  I have a physician's assistant.  There is a doctor there, and he is listed on my card.  However, I do not see him.  I see the physician's assistant.   She is very considerate and helpful.  If I have a need for anything, I can email her which is very helpful because it is hard for me to hear on the phone.  She usually gets back to me in a good amount of time.  She answers my questions the best she can.  
0.720000	I trust my Dr to a certain extent, I don't believe in taking so many different medications just to treat minor issues
0.520000	At the time I wasn't going to my primary doctor but I was pregnant and I guess I was taking off my mom's insurance so I couldn't make an appointment until they fixed it. Well when I finally got back on it and had an apoointment, instead of checking on the baby we just did a pregnancy test and questionnaires.  Second appointment was once I started losing him. They did a ultrasound and said he was fine. Later that day I had a huge headache and threw up the next day I was fine. That following Thursday he came out too early. When I told them my water broke they didn't try to help me. I had to take a picture in order for moves to be made. The nurse wouldn't tell me a gender. They never asked if I wanted to hold him or bury him. He was still attached to his cord and the placenta was somewhat still inside. For about 4 hours my son sat in between my legs with the placenta still inside of me. Once they finally found that type of doctor she took the placenta out and basically dropped him on the floor. I feel more should've been done that first and second appointment and both trips to the er. Then the following month they thought I had a std. Everything came back negative but no further tests on me as to why i had all the symptoms and why my son came out so early.  I had about 4 (I forgot what it's called but you get it often when you're in your 30s) last summer. Soon in August or September I had a follow up and he was a boy and there wasn't anything wrong with him. I knew that when we saw him on the ultrasound. He was alive and active. 
0.560000	I find that doctor rely most on what they are taught in medical school, which are mostly funded, staffed and run by pharmaceutical companies.  They tend to ignore holistic approaches that are not approved by the FDA and yet numerous studies have proven they work.

He orders routine bloodwork and always follows up on any irregularities.  He will call on a Sunday afternoon and say I was just reviewing your chart and I think we should do.....He is board certified and makes me feel confident in his decisions.

1.000000	I formerly disliked, feared, and distrusted doctors. I have recently found a new primary care physician in whom I have complete trust and great respect for. Doctor Hekman at Cleveland Clinic has completely changed my feelings about doctors. He is knowledgeable and compassionate especially regarding my being a transgender woman.
0.720000	INDEED I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN IT PROVIDES ME A GREAT ADVISE IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE MORE 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH HIM WITH NO PROBLEMS NOT RESOLVED

0.600000	I use the v.a hospital for my Drs. I just moved from Michigan to Tennessee & the Dr here is not staying on her job very well
0.720000	My primary care physician wasn't honest in a medical report over a small issue which causes a patient to mistrust!

0.800000	My doctor always takes the time tot talk to me.  I never feel rushed.  She will take all the time necessary.  She will answer any questions that I have very thoroughly.  Over time, she has won my trust by doing right by me.
0.600000	Doctor's are too tied to pharmaceutical companies so that has to be taken into account and I prefer to avoid meds whenever possible.
0.440000	The doctors are just for a paycheck and they really dont care about their patients.  It is sad that they dont have a caring heart.  I rather go to a doctor who really cares and not looking at you as money in their pocket
0.600000	She is helping me with my condition and she has more knowledge in that area than i do, so i trust her that she is doing the right thing.

0.320000	The last time at the physician's office my doctor gave me the same medicine that I was given at the hospital.  I went in for knee pain and unable to walk. I had the results sent to my doctor's office, but she didn't even remember looking at them. She didn't send me to get x-rays, MRI, or anything else.  Still having knee pain and very hard to walk.
0.800000	She actually cares, she listens to resolve instead of listening to respond. She allows me to speak and fully explain myself without cutting me off like most doctors. 
0.520000	I have never had a doctor that I trust 100% because they are human beings and they see a lot of clients in one day and have made plenty of mistakes. It is up to me to stay vigilant and decide on how to proceed based on my doctors suggestions.
0.600000	I like my primary care physician, but I don't really trust the technology that is used.  I don't trust that information entered into computers is always correct and not entered into someone else's account.  I would not trust everything that is done or said if it didn't seem to make sense.
0.760000	Shes nice and kind to me. She makes sure that my needs are taken care of and she listens to what I have to say and what questions I may have for her.
0.320000	Most docs where I live care about money, not their patients. There is very little access to a large health system in South Carolina where I reside and what we have is what we have. If you have to go to the ER it's best to go over the border to North Carolina than to go to Piedmont. 
0.480000	I have a general distrust for those with medical training. This is caused by a negative experience with a doctor that I had as a teenager.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a very long time with no issues ever my routine checkups go well with everything explained to me

0.600000	I had a hard time answering because I have not been to a PCP for 8 years or so because I have not been at all sick.
0.920000	I have been with her for 20 plus years and our relationship has grown to the point that I know she will not bs me on any issue
0.480000	My Doctor seems very lackadaisical to me. Going through the motions while trying to act interested in what I am saying.
0.760000	"I trust my primary care physician because I believe that (while it is a generalization), doctors are overall very dependable. However, I also feel as though many physicians will tell patients they ""need"" certain testing, only for their own financial gain."
0.680000	Not all doctors let patients know all of their options as far as treatments are concerned. I try to trust my doctors because I have to. They are the ones with the MDs in ultimately should know best. I do use my own judgment at the end of the day but put trust in my doctors and what they tell me.
0.640000	Depending on what type of insurance you have, some doctors may give you the cheapest treatment instead of what's best.
0.800000	He is thorough and answers questions also personally calls  with test results Will take time to explain tests ordered and why. Always feel he has time to listen appointments are never rushed
0.600000	i don't trust anyone especality doctors i mean what is the worst that can happen if one of their patients dies i mean after all the have malpractice insurance and the law on their side.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because I would think he knows what he is doing, at least I hope he knows what he is doing. I've only had one doctor in the past that I don't think he knew what he was doing and I found another doctor.
0.560000	feel rushed at the doctors office so i tend to gloss over a lot of problems and hope they just go away
0.800000	She listens to me and we have an excellent report. I think she is  caring and remembers me from previous appointments.
0.720000	some of the doctors are very trusting and some can be not as trusting and they have sometimes they kist think that its okay but i know better and i would get another opinion sometimes .
0.520000	"My Doctor is extremely overbooked and is always trying to get me out of his office as soon as possible. He interrupts me constantly when I am trying to describe why I am there. He does not answer any questions I may have ""telling me to ask the nurse:."
0.480000	My primary care is good enough.I really rely on my heart doctor though.My primary can be dismissive,abrupt and officious.My heart doctor is gentle ,sensitive and caring.
0.800000	I believe my physician has my best interest at heart and tries to offer the best professional help as possible.
0.760000	A primary care physician (PCP), or primary care provider, is a health care professional who practices general medicine. PCPs are our first stop for medical care. Most PCPs are doctors, but nurse practitioners and even physician assistants can sometimes also be PCPs.
1.000000	I very much trust my doctors at the VA,  they have been unreal kind, right on & always right.    Everything I've had done there has been great & right on with what they say.  I'm completely happy..
0.520000	Doctors in the past seemed to care more, and spent more time with you, now everything has a prescription, and they don't tell you about something that will work without prescription.  And it seems as if they're not really listening anymore.
0.600000	i trust my doctor fully...if i didn't i would switch doctors as soon as possible.... i have had my doctor for most of my life
0.680000	Because theybcan totally lie to you but yeah uavent you heard of doctors lying their patients like dude that's why slwmtimes you can't just trust undone like make sure you asked of their degree and look up there history 
0.960000	"Very caring.  His words to me were ""I'm going to treat you like I would treat my Mama.  And I love my Mama.""  He has even called me at home after hours to make sure I am okay."
0.640000	i have know my doctor for many years, trust all his recommendations and scripts.i have referred friends and family to see  also.
0.840000	I trust my doctor by telling them if something is wrong or if a medication isn't working. They are very helpful if i have a question for them
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor, but sometimes I feel as though the doctor may think some of the things that are bothering me are insignificant.
0.800000	Because she looks out for my well being if i have a problem she will recommend treatment or send to a specialist.
0.960000	I feel that they know what they are doing and really listen to my input and take that into consideration.
0.400000	I have seen a few different doctors over the past 10 years who have not taken me seriously and blew me off â that is when I came in with a list of things I wanted to have checked out, that had been bothering me over the several years that I had not been to a doctor, the doctor barely looked at the list and then told me I was normal and healthy without even checking the things and by the time I left the office I realized I haven't totally blown off. He didn't care.
0.360000	I was diagnosed last year with NF 1.. instead of my doctor trying to get me to a genetics doctor who specializes in what is wrong with me all he would do is say I had a patient with that once.. no test, no scans, no mri's, nothing to see what is going on inside.. I would show him the tumors on the outside of my spine and no reaction.. just I use to have a patient with that..
0.800000	My PCP seems to be a thoughtful woman and is very good at listening to me and my concerns.  She is not assertive so might seem hesitant but I feel that is just her way.
0.480000	Doctors are only in business because people are or think they are sick. You go to them for one thing & immediately they want to send you for testing to see if they can find something wrong. I feel if it isn't broke don't try to fix it. There is a lot of truth in the statement what you don't know won't hurt you. Some people make themselves sick because they worry what if.
0.640000	It isn't that I distrust him, but I rarely go to the doctor so I don't have many interactions to reference. 
0.400000	Because I hate people and no one truly cares about u unless they love you. People become doctors mostly for the paycheck 
0.560000	I feel like drs in general go the easy route. Also, I feel they prescribe more medicine than is necessary and it causes harm, and I don't like that feeling. 
0.640000	In the past I have been misdiagnosed three times finally I found a nice doctor who tested me for Lyme disease and it came back positive being misdiagnosed made it worse and very hard to eliminate.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he's been my doctor for many many years and knows me.  My only concern is that he sometimes deems my problems less serious than I do.
0.360000	He took me off a dangerous medication without out weening me off without caring about side effects of quitting cold turkey I.lost weight I can't sleep my anxiety spiked up I'm.jittery
0.840000	my doctor always seems to know how to treat me well I wouldn't go to anyone else unless referred to by my regular doctor
0.440000	too rushed, not enough time for appointment because they are running behind all day. too many patients.
0.520000	Im in the middle.  I trust him because he is a physician and he tries to make my health better.  In a way i dont trust him because he doesnt give me more alternatives to make my health better
0.760000	I often trust what doctors are telling me because most of the time, they are right. I believe that most doctors in America are well trained in medicine, so I would expect them to be very helpful and/or professional.
0.760000	I have a long term history with the medical practice and have had good experiences.  I have trained with several of the medical professionals and have trust in them.
0.760000	I trust my primary care phycician. Since coming into her care she has always been helpful as kind. I believe she helps me to the extent of her abilities. 
0.640000	I think there are high quality people in the healthcare professional and some that are not of average or less as providers. I judge by my interactions with each individual.

0.680000	I believe that most doctors have the patients best interest at heart and they want to help them get better and give them good medical advice
0.600000	At the moment I do not have a doctor.  The one I went to for many years retired a few years ago.  I have not needed one since that time.
0.520000	Do not always feel he is listening, but he does often get back to me after investigating certain things.
0.920000	because i feel we have a great relationship beyond patient and dr. i feel he is my friend looking out for my health and well being
0.840000	she is very through and knows exactly what my needs are and recommends specialist that I need to see for any problems she knows I need. she follow ups with my blood work to see if my meds needs to change. she ask me if i'm having any problems since my last visit and what is going on with my current health issues.
0.840000	though I've only been seeing this dr for a short time, she is thorough and compassionate takes her time with me at my appointments
0.720000	I trust my doctor, but I feel her decisions regarding my care are tied up because my insurance is Medicaid, and a lot of options are not open because they wont pay for it
0.800000	I trust my doctor in every way when he tells me what I need to do and when to do it and I have total trust in him

0.360000	I have been going to my primary care care phycisian for many years. He has helped my husband and I through several problems. I had one problem that he could not solve and he kept sending me to different specialists. After 3 years finally found the one in Dallas that immediately knew what my problem was. After open heart surgery he found a problem my husband had that the heart surgeon and heart doctor had missed. So yes I completely trust my family doctor. 
0.600000	Doctors are practicing physicians and to me that means they are still using us as experiments to see what will work and what will not work.  There are to many side effects for the drugs on the market to be prescribed for anyone there are more side affects than cure and the doctor knows this but yet they prescribe these medication for people what ever happened to using more natural products like the olden days.
0.840000	My doctor is an exception to the rule; she is interested in what I have to say and the questions I ask and is in no hurry to rush me out.  She leaves when I signal that I am satisfied with my visit.
0.800000	what with all the writing questions enough ok, my doctor is the best and has been for a long time but is retiring and that is a bumer
0.400000	My primary care physician didn't thoroughly investigate my son's condition when I brought him in. She just assumed it was the Flu because of the season. My son was later diagnosed  with a Pneumonia.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he always gives me options on treatments. he tells me the pros and cons of each type of treatment offered. He lets me choose what I feel is right for me.
0.800000	My doctor has demonstrated thoroughness for many years, and stays on top of my needs and/or issues. 
0.800000	I trust my provider because they are very good at explaining all the options available to me. She takes time to listen to my concerns, even if it isn't very serious.
1.000000	I have had my oncologist for the last 5-6 years and I trust his opinion and I trust his treatment for me I have cancer my life is in his hands so I trust them
1.000000	My doctor takes the time to explain options to my condition and never tells me what option I have to take.  She recommends what she thinks is the best option, but has no problem if I select another option. 
0.680000	been wit and hah him for 35 years he has helped me with so many health problemsand never steered me wrong
0.760000	my reasoning to why i trust my primary care physician is because she makes feel like i can be open with my doctor. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor as she listens to my concerns and addresses them with testing and the specialist I need. I have became better health wise since being under this doctors care
0.600000	Some doctors I feel rush through the appointment and I leave feeling uncared for which is not the purpose for my visit
0.520000	I dont have a primary care dr because of insurance reason but i do tryst drs however i feel they dont help everyone 
0.680000	My doctor has never done anything to not have my trust. He goes out of his way to make me feel comfortable and is willing to go out of his way for me and my family. To the point of calling me after hours when my oldest was sick and not getting better.
0.800000	Because he never really can tell me what is wrong with me. And I can't understand him clearly which bothers me. And he always blows me off
0.360000	In all honesty, I do not trust my doctor at all. It seems as if most doctors in general mostly just care about their own convenience and making money. Even though the job itself is to help people, to them it's still just a job to them at the end of the day. 
0.840000	of course i trust my doctor i have chosen him  because of his good fame and he always give me the right treatment.
1.000000	I have been seeing the same physicians for over 30 years. I have complete trust in them and am comfortable that they treat my family as well. I would be very disappointed if I had to find another physican(s).
0.880000	I'm lucky that I have not had to go to see my doctor often. I see a nurse practitioner and feel that see is totally competent and I trust her to give me the right diagnosis.   
0.720000	My doctor seems to have a thorough plan for my various ailments and seems open to any questions that I have.  I don't feel rushed by him during the appointments.  He is personable.
0.720000	Mostly I trust my doctor, although she is relatively new for me.  Initially, I did not feel that she listened well enough to what I was saying, but my latest visit with her felt much more complete and comfortable.
0.960000	I have complete trust in my doctor because of how he has treated me in the past with being ill also I've known the doctor for years 
0.240000	when i told her i had a cardiac problem she said i didnt. i ended up in the hospital for a cardiac ablation. she was told by my mental health doctor to check my thyroid, she didnt. when the cardiac ablation was done and bloodwork by the hospital they told me i had a thyroid problem.
0.920000	I trust my Rheumatologist and my Nephrologists because they got me on the right treatments to steady my condition to were I am more balanced mentally and physically.  
0.720000	Doctors are highly trained and know what they are doing. They would never intentionally do something to harm me. They want to make me better
0.960000	stop asking for such long answers to these questions   my doctor never steered me wrong  blah blah blah
0.560000	I do not know my current PCP well.  She is the 3rd PCP I have had in as many years. One doctor retired and the next one moved to an employee health position.Once I get to know a doctor and they get to know me we can work together equally to give me a positive outcome.  I have been on Medicare less than a year.  There are many changes in what a physician is allowed to prescribe for different parameters.  Each stage of life has it's own learning curb.
0.960000	My doctor has a great reputation with his patients.  He's been a great doctor and has treatment effectively when other doctors have not been successful.  He makes sure I understand everything before leaving his office.
0.760000	I have no problems so far. I have been with my doctor for a little over 2 yrs now. I think he does a good job and would recommend him, and have. 
0.600000	I am just a person the Doctor puts my name in the computer.  What happened to the good ole days when the Dr. Looks at me instead of the screen.
0.760000	I do trust doctors. The only thing I disagree with is if you call with a question they say go to the ER or doctor immediately. that is not always the case.
0.720000	I believe that I trust doctors in general because they have more knowledge that pertains to the situation that I might find myself in. They have endured the proper schooling and training required that qualifies them to make diagnoses, and give medical advice. They are professionals for a reason. 
0.800000	I have been with him for many years. I have done just about everything suggested and I am in pretty good health
0.600000	I didn't trust many of my previous Dr's.  I felt they gave me lip service and didn't really retake an interest in me. I now have a new medical person who seems to care.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she has never done me wrong. They have gone above and beyond to help me, and get the proper care I need.
0.560000	All doctors tend to have their own way of doing thing and thinking about issues. I feel like it is safe to say that they do not know everything and can be wrong just like anyone else.
0.560000	I don't think most physicians are as up to date as they should be or as willing to look into the issues that they should always
0.800000	Because they are well trained and experienced in their field, and they know more about my health than I don.
0.520000	To rushed with dealing with too many other clients every day of their lives also tyhey do not really carte since they all drive BMW;s every day..
0.960000	She does not pretend to know everything. She considers my ideas and opinions. When it comes to my health we act as a team.
0.760000	I have been dealing with my doctor for a very long time, over 30 years. We had many different discussions on multiple ailments, concerns, sickness, cures and how I feel. We always discuss how each cure, symptons, sickness and feelings and he has been thorough discussing what he feels that I need to do, actions that need to be done and when I have been sick he comes up with different suggestions that will assist or cure what ailes me. 
0.800000	I relay on the physician to make care of the situation that the doctor can determine to right medical knowledge best suited for me.
0.920000	My doctor is amazing. He has several degrees and is one of a handful of Holistic doctors in Minnesota. He is beyond smart, compassionate and honest. I've seen many doctors over the years, but this doctor is my favorite and only one I will ever see again.
0.760000	my doctor has given me no reasons to doubt his thoroughness and ability to treat me.  I trust he gives me good advice and wants me to be as healthy as possible
0.720000	I have been seeing him for a couple years and he has helped me. When I didn't know what was wrong he did and he also helped point me to someone else who tried to help me.
0.720000	I would not patronize a doctor in whom I didn't have trust.  That's counterintuitive.  Why would I go to a professional, then discount his advice/opinion.
0.800000	All doctor miss things on some patients that they deal wit they can't catch everything so if u smart enough to know something is still wrong even tho ur doctor told u that everything was ok u all ways go to a higher physician that can assist u better
0.760000	I have concerns about certain issues my doctor seems to just not care about or tell me its normal when i know its not normal for me, i dont like the word normal when it comes to health care because nobody is the same.
0.360000	If my doctor would try a little harder and ask the questions this survey has,  he might understand me more.  Instead he will ask two questions prescribe a pill and send me on my way.  
0.400000	I don't have a regular doctor anymore due to no insurance and the clinic we were seeing closed. Most doctors I've experienced blame any and all of my health issues on my being overweight. Unfortunately, this has left many conditions undiagnosed for years, some of which actually contributed to my overweightness.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he is truthful, he is always right in the diagnosis because he does all the necessary checks and he is also the family doctor
0.280000	I have found doctors are more interested in shoving pills down a patients throat than actually addressing issues that are causing the problems in the first place.
0.760000	I have never had a reason not to trust anything my doctor has told me.She's always very thorough and honest
0.560000	Sometimes my doctor doesn't remember my conditions and even though my chart is in front of him automated.  I have to remind him of my medical issues.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because we have worked together for a while and she knows what I need and she is always willing to help in any way she can
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I feel she is very open and he honest with me. I also trust her because she is very relatable. 
0.960000	I have now been with my particular Doctor for over 10 years.  He is the best and most concerned Doctor that I have ever had in my life time.  He watched over my health and concerns with loving kindness.  I trust his decisions for my  health Concerns completely.  
0.600000	i read a lot, so a dr. would really have to explain why i might need more medication or might need a procedure before i decide to go with her advice
0.520000	I trust them, but I also like to form my own opinion based on my knowledge and experience. Sometimes doctors are not familiar with your entire history so I think it is up to patients to advocate for their own best interests as much as they can. 
0.960000	I trust my primary physician based upon the relationship that we have developed since I began seeing him.I can trust him.
0.920000	I have recently acquired a new physician.  He is young and on the cutting edge.  He cares and is very attentive.
0.680000	He does listen to me and give me suggestions to solve a problem (see another doctor, specialist) but never has the answer himself.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician and most that I have visited in the past do not listen as well as they should.
1.000000	I have been with  the same doctor for quite sometime now I have full trust in him and his staff has well has the hospital that he works for , I have never had any doubts with him
0.840000	Well, I trust the doctors for their knowledge and their experience and that is the most important thing for me
0.680000	I trust my doctor as he has good reputation with patients,and i have found him to be quite honest,and straightforward in my treatments.
0.720000	I really love this idea, and I think it's really good, and interesting, this also shows a great variety of many things, and I personally think this is super interesting, and really shows a lot of information, and things.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for more than 10 years & he has helped me allot.  I can tell him I have a weird pain & he figures it out quickly.  
1.000000	Very good eye contact! Explains things carefully and completely, encourages questions. Not afraid to touch me! Takes his time, not in a rush like an assembly line.
1.000000	I think my doctor has a great deal of compassion and caring for all her patients...I know how she interacts with me and other patients and it shows she is a trustworthy doctor to all her patients.
0.600000	I truth my doctors they wont do anything that would hurt me they are there to help me not to do me any harm
0.800000	I have only been to my present PCP once, and have not completely formed opinions making it difficult to answer the questions on this page.  However, I was favorably impressed by him and intend to keep using him for the foreseeable future.
0.760000	My primary care physician spends time with me in my appointments and explains every little detail about the procedures or treatments that I may be going through. She never rushes and she always takes time for my questions. 
0.760000	I have had my primary care doctor for q little over a year now. I am comfortable talking about him with anything at this point.
0.960000	I have been going to the same primary care physician for many years, probably at least 20.  I have always trusted what he has said about my conditions because they correspond with the test results I have received.
0.800000	I definitely trust my physician in the sense that they are well trained  and belief they are competent
0.840000	I am comfortable with her. She answers my questions in a language I understand. I don't like to take medication, so we discuss how to do things in a natural way.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because she is never in a hurry to get to her next patient.  She makes sure you fully understand all of your options 
0.720000	I'm not sure if I trust the Doctor.  Now a days, he checks things off on the computer, while asking me questions.  I can do that!  Is the system good or is the doctor??? I don't know!  ...not sure!!!
0.400000	I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have been dealing with it for years, but I don't believe my primary care physician has helped me control it. They don't always listen to my concerns with taking certain medications.
0.800000	My doctor has been my physician for over 30 years and he has always been very upfront and honest with his medical decisions 
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because when I talk to her she gives me her opinion and with my medical back ground I know that she has my best interest at heart. I know she cares and can tell by the way she responds to me
0.600000	i dont typically go to a doctor something i need to start doing again in the very near future.. i was addicted to drugs and let my health go just began recovery getting back to health is important to me gain
0.960000	Very likeable doctor. Really wants me to be in good health. I am overweight and he wants me to work on that.
0.600000	I think I would distrust a doctor because they aren't involved in their patients health and they aren't prepared. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor, as I have seen him for a while and several of my family members (as well as family friends) go to him too. He is knowledgable and friendly, and is also open to hearing your thoughts and feelings about what's best for your health.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because she is always looking for and telling me about things I can do to improve my health. 
0.760000	I have no reason not to trust my primary care doctor.  If I have a problem, I can ask my doctor anything.
0.800000	He listens to me and we discuss the findings, treatments, and plan options. He is always been right, but I'm also a good historian of symptoms.
0.560000	Don't have a primary care doctor now but when I did I was never sure if he knew what he was doing. He once ruined a trip for me with a bad diagnosis.
0.640000	Overall, I trust my primary physician but I don't think they always want to commit to a detailed answer.
0.560000	i trust my primary physician because they really help the sick and they how to help every one they see
0.480000	Always rushed, pushing pills for things even if you don't need them. For example exercise and weight loss can help many conditions, but once you are on medication, rarely taken off. 
0.440000	I think doctors are more interested in making money through prescriptions than the well being of their patients. They often are too quick to prescribe medication with bad side effects, or are uninformed about what would be best for the patient. Sometimes they prescribe medication that would react badly with other medication that the person is taking. Because of this I have to take what they say with a grain of salt. It's better safe than sorry so I trust myself first. Plus doctors might forget some of what they learned in school.  I saw one of my doctors looking up the answer to their question online
0.840000	My doctor spends 45 minutes every time I go see him. It is much needed. We talk about my medications and if I am on track 
0.800000	he or she spent the time to do the hours for whatever good/bad reason to get the degree and then try to keep up, which maybe nerar imposssible
1.000000	I have been going to the same primary care physician for years.  I've never had a problem or reason to not trust him with my care.
0.760000	I think my doctor cares about what is wrong with me but i feel he is to busy to listen one hundred percent. He is at a clinc for low income people
0.360000	My past experience has demonstrated my confidence in my Doctor and his recommendations. His history of tests, advice and goals have proven correct.
0.600000	my promary doctor is very thoghell when notices the blood test he sends me to a specialist for further testing
0.320000	I don't think doctors are not taught enough about health.  I prefer to trust myself when it comes to my health.  Doctors only like perscriptions for health. 
1.000000	I've been with the same primary physician for 20yrs, I trust her and depend on her. She always has my best interest at heart.
0.800000	She takes times to be thorough ad suggest what I need. Always have confidencein what she does even though sometimes it is not something I want to do.
0.920000	I just found a new PCP, because my old one was grossly overweight and seemed to not treat  patients as individuals; she wasn't always this way; I know she has some personal problems.  She was wrong about some side effects I was having, and wouldn't listen to me.  My new PCP is very thorough, is a good listener, and is helping co-ordinate my care with several specialists, after an unexpected hospitalization.
0.760000	I have been going to him for a long time.He respects and knows what kind of person I am.He always Nswers my questions listens to me and helps in anyway he can
0.680000	If I didn't trust my family physician, I would not continue to visit his office.  I have been blessed with very good health (no major illnesses, never had to take prescription medicines at age 76) so it is difficult to judge my family physician as to trust or not. 
0.840000	I have always had a good long term relationship with my PCP. I see him several times a year even when I feel fine. Health checkups, flu shots a vaccinations ...we are always on good terms. If there's a problem, he won't sugar coat it..he'll be direct and honest...I like that.
0.480000	I think my doctor does not have time for me.  I have to be my own advocate to find out what is wrong.
0.440000	He is always pushing me to have surgery. when my back hurt he said surgery, I said physical therapy and the therapy fixed it. he now says I need knee replacement now, but when I went to the orthopedic surgeon, he agreed with me and put me in physical therapy and I am much better. 
0.800000	Doctors in general, I feel, are usually professional and honest and I would trust them in diagnosing whatever issue I'm having.
0.760000	When it comes to protecting your physical health, being able to communicate with your doctor openly and without reservation is essential. When you have a primary care physician that you trust, you are more likely to discuss any health concerns that you have, ask questions about your treatment options, and comply with your doctorâs medical recommendations
0.960000	My primary care doctor is always ready to be there when I need to talk to him and if he can't be there a nurse is always available to get back with me. He is available by phone 24/7 and that is a comfort to me. I have been going to him for several years now and also my brother has been going to him too. Makes sure appointments are set up so that I don't miss any. Explains things in a layman's language so that you can understand what is going on with you physically and what you need to do to take care of any health problems that could arise and to keep me healthy. Makes sure that all vaccines are up to date and that I get my flu shot every year. Very happy with him. Also my dermatologist I am very happy with..He is very up-to-date.
1.000000	She has always helped me out.  If she doesn't have the answer she sends me to a specialist.  She makes time to listen.
0.560000	I can trust my primary for basic everyday issues like a sinus infection or acne. But she is not a specialist and doesn't habe experience in more unusual issues.
0.880000	My doctor knows my body as much as I do, maybe more. He knows my existing condition, and past history. If we try a cure for something and it dosen t work, then after awhile, we will try something else.
0.600000	She does a good job in keeping up with my care and treatment. I feel comfortable in confiding in her with all my problems and medical needs.
0.800000	My doctor usually tells me everything that they want me to do and why I need to do this and why it will help me.
0.760000	I believe that most doctors sincerely care about their patients. A doctor should care about his/her reputation. I do not think doctors wake wanting a malpractice lawsuit. He/She will do their best unless there is lack of knowledge.
0.760000	My primary care physician is very easy to talk to and have discussions about any particular problem.  He is almost like a family friend.  We can talk about non-medical things, as well.
1.000000	My doctor has always helped me in any medical decisions I may have to make. I trust my doctor and she helps me in anyway she can
0.720000	I respect the intellect of medical advisory of physicians however I have faith greater than any man. I trust that people are in me path of life for a reason whether it's a doctor teacher etc. Subconsciously only believing in faith as my provider of knowledge.
0.960000	My primary care physician always listens to me.  He always answers any questions I have about any of my health issues.
0.440000	I ask about medicines I see advertised on TV if they would help. And he will sometimes say lest try it. Are if another doctor orders medicine for me he acts like it was his idea. I haven't found a doctor I truly trust.
0.680000	He has always been honest with me. He gives the expression that he undetstands and cares about how i feel. 
0.280000	I do not trust any doctor I have seen because all they do is ignore you and always write a prescription just to get you out of there office so they do not have to listen to anything your saying.
0.880000	I trust my physician Because she asks the right questions and helps me out. She just doesn't rush through the appointments
0.800000	I had a near fatal stroke in 2012. After nearly 3 months in various local hospitals, I had to pick a primary care physician since I never really had one.  I picked my current doctor and haven't regretted it one bit.
0.720000	I feel that doctors have a person's best interest at heart. I sense see that in the emergency room,  people seem to have the same diagnosis. 
0.920000	I have known my physician for over thirty seven years as I worked around him at the local hospital where we both worked .He is very informed of each and every health issue I have and if I need a specialist he is very forth coming in recommending one on my behalf
0.920000	I have been with her for years and have never know her to put me off or not listen. She listens to what I have to say and goes with me. Her medications are spot on and she has checked my record before we have an appointment so we do have to play 20 questions.
0.800000	It has taken me several years to develop positive relationships with all my physicians.  If a doctor does not meet my needs I look for someone who is a better fit.
0.600000	Doctors in general have to work to gain my trust-I have had very bad experiences in the past with doctors, so I would say that I am wary anytime I see a doctor.
0.560000	I am neural. I neither trust nor distrust my doctor, however I put the most trust in myself and my family. They know me better.
0.920000	"She is ""new"" since my doctor left  and I had to find another.  She is earnest, thorough and explains what is need to know,"
1.000000	I have been with the same doctor since I was a teenager and I completely trust him. I never   feel uncomfortable around him because, i know that, i can trust him.   I love my doctor and we share a very friendly relationship with each other at all times.
0.560000	I do not trust my primary care physician, but I do trust my specialist.  My PCP seems to be in a hurry and the practice is inflexible, and pushing tests/vaccinations I'm not interested in.  
0.800000	was very close to my last primary care physician who has unfortunately retired but he set me up with his primary care physician who is great and I go to a great hospital with an excellent reputation. I feel like I can articulate any issues and questions necessary
0.920000	He knows me well and even asks me if I have researched something to enable us to better understand a subject
0.760000	I trust my doctor but I always do my own research about my health and medications. I have no problems asking if something is right for me.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he always listens when I express concerns. He takes what I say into consideration and does not dismiss me rudely. He treats me as if he cares about me as a person not just a patient.
1.000000	I believe that the Veterans Hospital has the best Doctors and Nurses and they have been treating me very well for over 30 years
0.960000	Have had same dr for 8 years and has always looked out for my best interest and has made sure the I get the medications that I need
0.720000	i have no response to this question because i feel every dr are sworn to be honest to every patient 
1.000000	my doctor is honest with me. She gives me the advise I need. If I have a problem, I can rely on my doctor to give me the answers I need and require, I have a lot of failh in my doctor.
0.840000	I trust my physician because she genuinely cares about what is best for me and she always advises me to take extra precautions just in case because you can never be too careful.
0.960000	I trust all doctors to a point, and that point is there is a LOT of new information out there, new discoveries, theories and medicines. The average primary care physician cannot possibly learn it all.    When I had diverticulosus, the surgeon was going to remove part of my colon, and told me I may or not need a colonoscopy bag. I daughter and another friend looked up liposcopic surgery, and suggested that to drain the shit that was filling my abdomen. The surgeon agreed to try. It was successful. When he finished, the surgeon declared that if he ever had diverticulosus, he would want this procedure. I think we can trust our doctors, but we need to educate ourselves to make life better for all of us.
1.000000	"My primary care doctor has been part of my life for 26 years! He & I know each other well & have ""grown"" over the years."
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician moderately. I have so many health issues on going it is hard for her to keep up with what is going on. I went to have knee replacement surgery in February. Ended up having my ankle fused instead. Apparently I was walking on a broken foot and ankle for over a year. It was aggravating my knee issues. 
1.000000	my primary doctor has all my my health in good hands and she works to keep me on the right track. she is truly successfully keeping her pentions in good health 
0.680000	I am a retired RN so I know a lot about medicine, I know the kind of questions I need to ask to understand my condition and I realize the physician works for me and I'm not intimidated.
0.720000	I feel like I am going through an express line in the food line. I go in he asks me a few questions, write a prescription and that is it. They do not get to know you personally.
0.720000	My doctor and my health care plan have a very good reputation. Therefore, I am trusting them for my Healthcare needs.
0.720000	I wonder if there might be something she's not telling me to keep me from becoming upset--not diagnosis-wise, but possible non-serious effects of medicine or activity
0.720000	I don't trust doctors because their not trustworthy I always trust my gut instinct. And I don't know why I have to type so much
0.720000	My Doctor is very thorough and I trust his recommendations for treatments or prescriptions. However, I always do my own research and have refused drugs based on public evidence of problems.
0.840000	I have known and used the same primary care physician for over 30 years. I have high confidence in my Dr. based upon many years of interaction.
0.840000	they are nice  and help you when  you   have  diabetes or when you are sick  and they are nice and special and caring
1.000000	My doctor spends the time with me to not only get to know me but II know what my concerns are and delves into things that could be harmful to me and make sure that don't have things negative to my health that can't be seen on the surface
0.600000	I usually feel that doctors are in a rush and not always taking the time to get all the information to make a diagnosis or recommend treatment 
0.760000	He is relaxed, personable and most importantly, approachable.  These attributes make him trustworthy and reliable.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is always honest and trustworthy and helps me in any situation that I need her opinion or advice.
0.800000	My primary physician and I are a team. He knows me well enough to suggest various options for health care with me first before just ordering test or medications. I normally tell him what is wrong and how I think I should be treated and he will either agree or recommend a different course. I trust his opinions and feel very confident in discussing issue with him if I have concerns about what he says to me.
0.760000	I went through 3 PCP's before deciding to stick with my current choice. This one said the right things on my first visit and instilled confidence in his approach from the get go a marked contrast from the previous two.

0.800000	I trust my physician to do what he and I both think are correct in keeping me healthy and protecting my medical records
0.800000	I feel like he has been honest and forthcoming with me.  I went in with questions and I expected him to have answers, because when I chose him, we had a similar outlook about the prescription drug epidemic in America.  That being said, I asked about different vitamins and supplements, since I'd heard a lot of them are unnecessary.  Not only did he tell me which ones I need, but the amounts, which was hugely helpful

0.720000	My Doctor is very caring despite the short time I have with her during check-ups and I trust her judgement. She always answers my questions and does her best to give suggestions.

0.840000	I have been going to my doctor for years and have not had any problems. She tells me exactly what I need to do and why
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. He takes the time to actually sit and listen to my concerns and thoroughly answers every question I have.  He is a doctor, and educator, a mentor and friend.

0.680000	I am a skeptical person about everything really. I know it's not called for a lot of the time but I just can't help it. I often question whether or not the doctor has my best interest at heart.

1.000000	I have been going to my doctor for years & he is honest & straight forward about telling me what is wrong.
0.560000	I have not been with my primary care physician very long. I was with my last doctor for 22 years and trusted her extremely. She was very thorough and took great care of me.

0.720000	I trust doctors to a certain extent. although sometimes I feel as if I need a second opinion depending on the situation. 
0.600000	I do not have a primary doctor and do not trust western medicine.  Drugs that are legal are also harmful to people.
0.800000	The only doctor I see is my dentist.  I HATE going to the dentist, and refused to go for decades.  Pain overrides fear to a point so I went.  I still get a nervous wreck when I go; but I trust him.   So far he has been very nice and careful.  He even gave me a free filling.
1.000000	I was diagnosed with breast cancer 17 years ago.  I followed my doctors suggestions regarding treatment & medication and am cancer free and have been for quite a while.  The doctor discussed and explained every in great detail

0.320000	I had little choice in who s my primary care physician, limited by my insurance.  He has a large caseload and cannot spend the proper time.  Also, he is careless and has often prescribed inappropriate medication that would have harmed me if taken.  Generally shoddy medical practice
0.920000	My doctor understans and is careing about you i trust him to the fullestmy doctor care he stays the same make me want to go back
0.680000	As a patient, you have probably had the experience of meeting a physician for the first time and very quickly becoming comfortable that he or she has your very best interests utmost in mind. The sense comes quickly; you become comfortable, less anxious. Unfortunately you may have had the opposite experience of encountering

0.600000	My doctor tends to think clinically as opposed to holistic. That is, she would rather have take another drug rather than finding a solution that might be more healthy without side effects. 
0.520000	I don't usually trust doctors to treat patients as individuals, but instead use a one size fits all approach, by which I mean over-issuing prescription medications instead of offering alternative solutions for curing and/or managing health conditions.
0.840000	Doctor dont tell u everything they just trying to get paid just want u to take different medications
0.600000	Some of my specialists are excellent doctors, but others take an approach f get the meeting over with as fast as possible

1.000000	My Primary care Physician is a HEALER, NOT A BUSINESSMAN, LIKE THESE YOUNG QUACKS THAT ARE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. Outside of my father, he is the finest man I have ever encountered. 
0.720000	I like my primary care physician, but I don't ever fully trust my healthcare to any one individual. Humans are fallible. I take my physician's advice, but I will separately do my own research and, ultimately, decide for myself and talk it over with my physician. If I disagree with them entirely, I will seek out a doctor that will oversee my care in the best way I see fit. 
0.680000	Sometimes they give you the wrong information . Or may say you have something and not tell you what to do about it.

0.480000	I like him a lot and think he is good and means well, but he is always in a hurry and lookingâat the computer too much. I think he is overbooked.
0.640000	distrust has been established due to a mutual disrespect amongst myself and the non-medical personnel that staff the doctors office. As they seem to believe that they are well aware of how to treat me and better capable of handling it than I. 
0.240000	"She doesnt take the time to figure out my treatment optionsb she just goes with the first thing she knows. If she doesnt know of an alternative, she says its something i ""have to do"" regardless of negative side effects I've already experienced on that course of treatment. In my own personal reaearch i often discover multiple other avenues of treatment thay may work better for me, but she is unwilling to listen to my concerns."

0.720000	My Doctor spends a lot of time listening to me which makes me feel as though she truly wants the best for me. However, now and then she writes referrals or orders tests that I never hear about again and had nothing to do with my complaints.
0.840000	They are the experts in knowing your conditions and how to treat the conditions. Knowledgeable doctors are the best in knowing what is wrong with you they have to keep up to date with all the medical conditions that are coming up in the world today.
0.800000	She has always been open with me about her feelings and suspicions as well as the eventual official diagnosis. She treats me with respect, and, even though she knows more than me, she doesn't talk down to me when she explains things.
0.760000	I had a bad doctor, ended up almost dying because we (doctor and I) ignored my health. After getting out of icu, I changed my doctor and my attitude regarding my health. I an now back on track with a doctor who listens and makes me listen!

0.800000	I feel that my primary care physican has my best interests at heart. He spends a lot of time with me and answers all my questions to my satisfaction.

0.800000	I have been with my PCP for several years and I have grown to have more and more trust for him. Since Doctors are people too they can make mistakes or have errors in judgement. The one that graduates at the bottom of their class still gets the same credentials as one who graduates at the top.

0.640000	I don't know that I actually trust my doctor, but I don't actually distrust her either. I guess I trust her to do what's best until she proves otherwise.
0.480000	"Primary care physicians usually are very straight forward with the facts and available treatments, but most are in and out types. Diagnosing the problem quickly without digging very deep into the situation, giving the usual treatment that has worked well for ""most others"" and not thinking whether or not the treatment would be best for you. "
0.840000	I feel my doctor has my best interest in mind and treats me with dignity and respect at all times. I have no complaints about my treatment.
0.600000	I had galstones in Sept. Of 2015 and my doctor thought it was an ulcer. This made me sicker for longer, and I couldn't get the care I needed. That's why I distrust doctors sometimes.
0.800000	i consider my doctor a friend. he is very open and honest to me even when he knows i might not like his advise.
0.600000	i see my doctor once a year she is very nice and easy to talk to good at having tests down and prescribes the medications i need
0.320000	Doctors only care about shoving pills and expensive treatments at their patients.  They care about money and not how to fix issues with patients.

1.000000	I have 4 very close drs that have been actively in my life one for 15 yrs  another for 14 and the other two i believe now 4 yrs. They know my body better than i do. I completely trust all 4 to any descisions may may conclude
0.640000	I don't trust them as much as I use tro. They do not take the time to learn about you and listen to your concerns it is a joke.
0.760000	I feel that she wants what is best and is honest and has my well being first when it comes to me and my health
0.640000	I trust him, he is very nice and kind and seems to care about his patients and wants what is best for them
0.560000	"The reason I trust and don't trust doctors is because I feel that a large majority of them are financially driven and often give responses to clients/patients based off of biases. I also believe that even some honest doctors tend to sometimes fall victim to having to concede to company policy's and ""unethical"" medical industry standards."
0.920000	Doctors and nurses ppl must have full trust in and clinic and hospitals along with billing and paper work 
0.400000	doctors are paid by number of tests and other billable transactions they can perform on patient.  so they are only interested in increasing the number of tests and unnesessary operations for no health benefit.  need single payer health care
0.640000	I have had great doctors and I have had bad doctors. It takes research and checking them out before you trust a doctor.
0.840000	I have bene going to him since I was 16 and he has always given me good advice and medicane to amek me better when I have been sick
0.400000	They don't give me options for any medications or treatments. They also don't go in depth about explaining all of them to me. They only explain the one thing they want me to try.
0.680000	"My doctor has a few quirks -- she is somewhat superstitious, and seems to believe in some ""old mother's tales"" regarding diagnosis methods.  On the whole, however, she seems to trust modern medical techniques more, although there are times when I worry about her judgement (""you must be a very jealous person -- you're quite ticklish"", said by her with little or not evidence that she is saying it as a joke, for example)."
0.680000	I really like my PCP. He listens and relys on my instincts as to what is going on. He is geniuinely nice and appreciative of my time and efforts.
1.000000	I can depend on my provider. I trust that my provider will steer me in the right direction. My provider has never given me at reason to have trust.
0.480000	I can't really say weather or not I trust my doctor because its usually always different. That's what I think I usually want a 1st 2nd and sometimes 3rd opinion 
0.720000	I like him and have known him for 30 years. Not sure I trust him completely but he's pretty good. Needs to spend more than 10 mins. with each person...
0.680000	He seems to know what he is doing and I rarely see him for anything outside of being sick which I rarely am
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for 15 years.  She is awesome and has made me feel completely comfortable with all of my health care questions and needs.  I travel almost an hour to see her as her practice moved.  I have no qualms about driving that distance because I know I am getting superior health care.
0.720000	I see a nurse practitioner in a clinic and he always takes time with me, never seems in a rush. Willing to get things tested if I wish, if it's not an urgent matter. 
0.880000	In my lifetime of 79 years I have had no reason to distrust my doctors. I have done research into my choice of physicians and am therefore confident that they are trustworthy.
0.600000	I do not even have a primary care physician. I have not seen a doctor in years. I am in good health and do not need to visit a physician for any problems. 
1.000000	I have a new primary care physician who is very cordial, friendly, smiley, smart, and caring. He looks at you and listens carefully to what you say and responds very politely and respectfully. He explains things nicely and with details and examples. He takes his time with you and makes sure he's answered all of your questions before the session is over. He doesn't order unnecessary tests or medications. He is great!
0.440000	Doctors today spend too little time with each patient because they're in a rush to get to the next one. Doctors also hand out prescriptions for medications based on the added income they make for doing so. Its very difficult to rely on and trust the medical community anymore.
0.440000	she is curt, rolls her eyes when i tell her what is going on with my body, she is dismissive. she doesn't tell me stuff like do not  take your thyroid pill before your blood work, so my blood work is screwed up, i know she does not believe things i have had tested or experienced in the past are true facts. they are quite oddities and hard to believe, but yet all of them tested at least 3x before the dr's back then believed what was going on. it is my fault i am still with her, but my file could probably go around the earth once. i am lazy and honestly do not want to fill out new patient info sheets. when i do see a new dr, i have them send me the forms and it usually takes me about 3-5 days to fill them out.  i am content to know what i am dealing with my mean dr.
0.600000	Doctors are in it for the money from the health care industry. Doctors do not listen to their patients.  All they want to do is write scripts and not solve problems holistically.
0.680000	I think that for the most part that doctors do look out for you and want the best for you but I also thing that life gets in the way sometimes and maybe they just want to shuffle you out of the office so they can go home.
1.000000	SHE IS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL RELAXED AND TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER ALL MY CONCERNS. SHE IS ALSO REACHABLE WHEN I CALL.
0.600000	I just feel at times I am more of a # than a patient. In and out quickly without always listening to me. I. The past I have had to go to the doctor 3 or 4 times for the same issue before that issue is actually dealt with. That sucks to me.
0.680000	I trust that he knows what he is doing and that he wants whats best for me and my health. Ive also have never had a problem with my doctor.
0.840000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because I have been seeing him for a few years of my life. It's been enough time for me to gain my trust.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing my doctor since I was 3 and he has never disappointed me 
0.560000	I trust my Primary because we hve been going to him for years as a family and he cares for each of us as if we are his own family. I feel I can talk to him about most anything.
0.760000	She has always been earnest with me about whatever I when to see her about. She has never beat around the bush when it comes to my health.
0.680000	I would generally assume that they are giving honest answers, and given their training and experience it would seem sensible to trust them. They would have little reason to deceive me, although some of it involves guessing.
0.520000	I have learned that it is best to watch out for yourself  with the medical field.   Find out all you can about any treatments they suggest.
0.720000	he takes the time to listen and explore options with me. he listens thoroughly and consults when necessary
0.240000	I don't believe my doctor has read my medical history and pays any attention to me when I try to address it. The doctor is constrained by some CDC guidelines  which have left my issues untreated for years now and now I suffer more issues so I no longer trust my health care office and they also gave me a vaccine that I had refused for years and I decided to not worry about it until the bill came for $375 that insurance will not pay and that I do not have. I no longer trust them and don't feel I have anywhere to turn for medical care at this time.
0.200000	doctors dont seem to care like they used to.  They rush thru the appts just to make that money.  They dont listen nor do they act like they care about what you are saying.  
0.720000	Depends on the expertise of the doctor. If he/she is a specialist then I have a little more faith in the diagnosis. 
0.680000	I trust them because I feel like they know what they are doing and how to approach a certain problem. I also trust them because previous treatment have turned out to be good for my problems 
1.000000	He has always took time to listen to my concerns or questions, makes sure he answers and acknowledges everything I say or ask. He always makes sure I know how to contact him via the offices site and e-mail if I have any further questions or concerns.
0.800000	I believe in my doctor and she very thorough and I have confidence in her.  Whenever I hav had a problem she has always been right.  She is very cautious
0.720000	My doctor is pretty good at being very diligent and listening to me and answering all my questions and exploring all treatment options.
1.000000	She is very smart about what is new .When ever I call emergency, she takes me on . She never knocks me down .Explains every thing an never rushes me out !!! 
0.920000	The reason I trust primary care physician is because because they always explain test, results and procedures in a way that I can understand exactly was is happenings
0.600000	I don't have a regular primary doctor due to not having health insurance so I see a general based on income doctor when I'm sick.   
0.560000	I know you lying. I was just aBout to make sure you have to be a good girl. She said she was going to move up there for the summer. I was just aBout to get married. The only way to get my own place in the bed . U can be found in the bed and breakfast in the bed  
0.760000	I don't necessarily distrust them, but overall they just want the salary and some of them are being paid by pharmaceutical companies for certain drugs 
0.680000	My doctor is a good doctor, but her staff is not very responsive to patients needs. She doesn't understand my personal problems as well as she should.
0.600000	i trust her because she always listens to me and helps me out all the time makes sure that i feel safe and any test i want done or need done she does it i like it its nice 
0.680000	I believe that many doctors will run unnecessary tests to make a quota set my their practice.  For instance, a dermatologist may do a biopsy when there is not a good reason.   
0.840000	My primary care physician does not make recommendations lightly and explains decisions carefully. He listens to my concerns.
0.840000	I see a resident doctor that practices in a family clinic.  My doctor is supervised by experienced physicians.  I trust my doctor because she listens well.  She has supervision regarding her treatment decisions.  In addition, I have net some of her supervisors
0.200000	They don't listen to the patient.  They give you therapy before they even xray anything.  Everything is either your dehydrated, to walk, go check your eyes and other hairbrained answers.  I wish old school doctors still existed.  These young ones are terrible.
0.880000	Because I've been seeing him for years and I haven't had a any problems, He's good and professional 
0.440000	All doctors treat you for symptoms you dont need medical attention for. They get a kick from certain medications, so they convince you to take it. We have proven it. A doctor told (Ã) to take (said medication), and (+) didnt take it, and after 6 months, there was no difference.     I only take mine when I need to.
1.000000	My doctor listens to me and explains test results clearly. If I have any questions he takes the time to answer them. He doesn't rush through anything.
0.520000	I mainly trust the doctors that I see or my children but I definatly make sure that we agree upon a treatment
0.760000	I ask a lot of questions about my health and usually am given the straight facts by my doctor. If I don't get the best answers I always ask for a second opinion. My doctor has been very upfront and completely honest with me on anything that we discuss.
0.720000	I tend to trust Doctors that listen to my concerns more so than Doctors that talk at me with a know it all attitude.
0.960000	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  I trust him completely for my care.  He does a great job.  I would listen to his advice and suggestions. 
1.000000	She listens to what I have to say and asks questions rather than jump to conclusions.  She also checks up with me yo see if the treatment we decided on us working or not, or hiw a consult with another doctor went.  She has never been dismissive of any issue I've gone to her with.  I feel that she honestly cares for my health.  
0.600000	i trust my doctors to a certain extent but you cannot trust anyone completely. i dont have any specific complaints about my current doctors. 
0.920000	I HAVE BEEN LUCKY DO TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS, THATS WHY IN TRUST HIM AND OR HER

0.560000	it seems to work out just fine for me. I find that i can trust doctors pretty easily and have no issue in that regard because i have never had any reason to not trust them. so it works in my favor. 
0.520000	Don't always spend enough time or ask if you have any questions. Just want to get you in and out. Therefore how can one totally trust if they don't get to know you as a person.

0.800000	Have been a patient for 18 years, he has never steered me wrong yet. He is very dedicated and thorough with me, taking his time with me at my scheduled appointments. I even have his cell phone number in case of an emergency.

0.480000	Doctors are good for diagnoses, but prescribing medication is one thing I do not trust doctors in this area. I believe medications are prescribed for the doctors benefit, not the patient.
0.880000	I trust my doctor completely, he has the knowledge to tell me all the options that I have for what is wrong with me.  We will talk it over and come up together with what we are going to do.
0.680000	my doctor is human and even though researches the products still want to make a quick buck and ginipig pig us patients
0.840000	I trust her because she is a very good peron.  She tries to do her best at all times.  The small lack of confidence I  might have relates to her overlooking something or being pressed for time.
0.920000	I trust my mental and physical doctors as they seem very concerned and helpful, even tho I may not agree with them., I feel they are straight forward with me and my problems
0.600000	I haven't been seeing him long enough to completey trust him.  I had a doctor before him who I thoroughly trusted but she left.
0.760000	I have had alot of experience in dealing with doctors because I took care of my ageing parents. I do know that sometimes doctors do whats easy for them and they look at the ageing elderly as if their life is almost over anyway. For that reason and others I dont truely trust every word my doctor tells me. I get second opinions first.
0.880000	My doctor usually takes plenty of time to talk about my concerns; I almost never feel rushed. She is kind, concerned and considerate
0.840000	I've been going to see him a long time and he tells me the truth...even when it's hard to hear.  He never spares my feelings and always shoots straight with me.  I really appreciate it and trust everything he says.
0.760000	I guess I was always raised to have the utmost respect and trust in my primary doctor. they have never given me any reason to distrust them. I feel very comfortable with their opinion on all things .

0.560000	My primary care physician seems inexperienced and doesn't give an educated opinion of my symptoms. She doesn't ask many questions of give helpful solutions to my medical problems.

0.960000	I recently switched physicians and have found a truly remarkable one who actually listens to me and works with me
0.800000	its hard to trust sometimes. sometimes they are just there for the money, and some really do care about you
1.000000	Because honesty trusworthy, down to earth easy to speak to and explains in a eay to understand. Easy to lean from
0.800000	My doctor has never given me false or misleading information. He's always been straight forward with me, even when he knows there are things I should change but probably won't. 
0.640000	I trust her because I know that she listens to me and what I have to say. However I don't think that she agrees with my diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, which was diagnosed long before she became my doctor, and so I feel she does not really believe the pain that I am in. She also seems to be always looking for another reason for my pains. Which I have been through numerous times with other doctors. So I don't always trust her to believe me. 
0.400000	They don't have the same helpful enthusiasm when you don't have insurance. They rush through the visit, take their time getting to you, and assume you just want drugs. 
0.840000	There should be a general patient to doctor relationshipâ, to where I can trust them and to where they can trust me. If I can not trust this doctor I have to find one I can trust. Mistrust can result in my life ending so I prefer to go to a doctor I can trust with my life.
0.600000	My doctor just hurries through the appointment and does not really listen to me especially about woman problems and he just does not understand or know how to fix them.

0.600000	I generally trust doctors, but also have some degree of skepticism and will ask questions of medical providers until satisfied with the answers I have received.
0.720000	i view my doctor a partner in giving me the best advice from their professional point of view, but at the end it's really my decision to make
0.800000	i think my primary care physician is very skilled and is straight-forward.  he is also compassionate (and funny)
0.640000	I trust my doctor to do his job and explain my medical options. It's not his job to decide for me, so I wouldn't take his recommendations automatically.
0.960000	He's a great guy that truly wants me to be as healthy as I can. I swear he wants me to live to 150, happily, healthy, and active.
0.760000	My doctor always seems to know what the correct diagnosis is for any given thing for which I consult him. Sometimes he's a little rushed but he does try to make conversation and show interest in my life outside of whatever medical issue is at hand.
0.720000	My doctor explains my condition with good verbal skills and help me understand his medications and the way to take them and how to use them.
0.680000	I feel like my doctor is quick to prescribe something for my condition without fully testing me or suggesting natural methods or cures. 
0.760000	For the most part, I feel that they are most knowlegeable about medicine. I have no reason not to trust their judgement for most health information.

1.000000	I have never had a doctor recommend anything that was harmful for me. My doctor's have always been sure that i understand everything going on with me. 
0.680000	I trust that my doctor tries to do well by me.  However, I think sometimes she is in too big a hurry or is distracted.  I can not trust her completely because she is only human and can make mistakes.  I have to take responsibility for my own health.
0.800000	I trust him completely.  He has never given me reason not to trust him.  He takes as much time as needed with me when I visit.
0.640000	my main dr is a va dr. I trust her for the present time. sometimes I feel that she is just searching for a problem and a cure. but overall I am pleased with what she has done.

0.760000	My primary care physician is a local p/a but is not afraid to refer me to specialists in larger cities as necessary
0.520000	In the 1950's a medical career was a vocation of helping others despite the fact that it paid much more in respect than money. By the late 1960's medical school had become a hard, but sure way to wealth. Too many are focused on the payoff today. 
0.760000	I have been with the same doctor for 18 years.  I trust him to make the right decisions concerning my health. 
0.600000	I generally trust my doctor because she is highly educated and has gone through years of training in her profession.

0.920000	Good communication is a must with your doctor. Mine is a very relaxed and sincere man.

He explains everything fully and has a game plan for how to proceed forward, and I love that about him.

0.600000	i have only met my primary care physician once. i do not tend to trust most people so doctors are no exception to that rule.
0.200000	I think most doctors are in it just for the money I take their advice with a grain of salt and research stuff on my own...I have been given wrong advice often and wrong diagnosis more then once
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I have not found anything to distrust them about. I understand what he tells me and it always seems to fit with what diagnosis he has for me. I make sure to look up things and learn about them and nothing has ever raised my suspicions that my doctor is wrong or way of base.
0.200000	They are self serving like all humans, which means they can't be trusted. This is true for any given example involving humans and trust. However, individuals can be trusted. The problem is there are too many doctors and not enough caring people. Doctors want to line their pockets in gold and caring people want to actually help. Unfortunately, there are little to no caring people left in this world. Doctors sign up knowing the work will he hard, then when they actually see it is difficult, they just give up and turn into worthless meat sacks like everyone else. They commit themselves to a life a servitude then do nothing of the sort. They are profoundly hypocritical in most aspects, and far too lazy to truth know how to, or be able, to help. Doctors are worthless in our society. Until I actually see one personally that is willing to deal with the rabble and listen to my personal, legitimate problems as just that, I will never trust, nor respect those morons. 
0.720000	because i trust my primary care physician and i have complete trust in my doctor. My doctor is totally honest
1.000000	I have been with him for a long time. He listens to what  I have to say and works hard to make sure that he gives me good care and treatment and gets me feeling better. If there is something he feels he can not help me with he will find someone who can treat me better
0.840000	I trust her, but so far she's been fine. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 5 years ago, and then my doctor retired and I started with this doctor. I lost 55 pounds on my own and she took me lots of my meds including Alendronate because I was on it for 10 years. My osteoporosis didn't get better, but stayed the same then I hurt my back and they found two fractures, so she put me back on it. She also doesn't check for A1C because no diabetes anymore. So I trust her, but really doesn't check a lot of things.
0.600000	All my trust is and will remain in God.  I only trust Him an if He assigns a doctor for me I believe that he will use her in a honest way.
0.800000	I sometimes research my doctor's suggestion.  It seems like when I do, I ask him more questions.  I do not disagree with him very much.
0.600000	I strongly consider their opionions but dont necessarily trust them. Some doctors force their bias on patients amd are sometimes inpatient and rude. 
0.800000	I've known him since I was a kid. He's been my family and personal doctor for over 30 years and I trust him. He's helped me through quite a few issues and struggles.
0.920000	My doctor has never steered  me  wrong or had me  do anything  without listening to my concerns . He  explains things to me in simple language.
1.000000	Because he was my student in high school; I know him well; we have a strong bond and I know that he would not tell me to do anything that he wouldn't tell his own parents.

0.720000	I've been with my doctor for 10 years and I trust her and I'm very healthy person so I tend to only see her once a year 
0.440000	I have had doctor's only tell me information that would make them the most money, or be lazy and not give me all the information, especially if was not convenient for them.  It's hard to ever know for sure if a doctor is telling you everything or not.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to explain things to me, answer my questions and have a discussion with me regarding my health.
1.000000	I have know my doctor for a long time. I trust what he does. He looks after my best intrests and takes care of me.

0.760000	I have been going to my family practice for over ten years. I am very comfortable with the doctors, nurses, and aides working there. They take the time needed with me, listen to all my concerns and answer all my questions, and will offer me additional options if need be.
0.800000	My primary care physician cannot and does not treat all of my health issues, but I trust him to refer me to specialists who can help me.
0.560000	These days I feel that doctors care (with some exceptions) more about their bottom line than their patients.  Not so long ago I believed everything that my doctors would tell me but not any longer.  I was particularly miffed when a former orthopedist had no clue as to how to help me after I fractured my hip and got really upset when I sought a second opinion and had the other doctor operate on me.
0.680000	he listens and explains things very well.my family has been a patient of his for over twelve years and everyone understands his explainations and plans for treatment.
0.400000	I tend to trust my physician inasmuch as he knows me for nearly 30 years and I know him well enough to know when I'm getting short shrift.
0.600000	It seems to me that most if not all doters are working for pharmsudical companies to try new drugs on unsuspecting patients,which seldom works on individual people rather than the majority
0.960000	I trust my DR as he is always kind and asks all the right questions and spends time with me also I never call unless I am really sick and he always sees me the same day
0.880000	I go to my GP with a concern about something, and even if she doesn't think that is what is happening, she will still follow through in checking herself, or else she will give me a referral to a physician that can give me peace.  Every specialist I have from her referrals has been just as interested, and just as careful to handle my concerns as my primary.
0.520000	I go in his office and he asks me how I am doing and looks at the lap top to see what is going on and says a few words and then says I will see you in 6 months. I keep him just for my medications.
0.800000	My previous Doctor took time to explain everything to me. I never felt rushed. He knew my medical condition and always provided me with the latest and best treatment for me. 
1.000000	He is the best in his field! He's very caring and has a great bedside manner. He's open and honest with me. He talks through things with me and I can page him when/if I need him. 
0.600000	M doctor is big on test results but not as good as chatting about life. He is getting better. I talk with him more each time, and tell him what I need.
0.440000	I don't necessarily trust physician's opinions a hundred percent of the time because they can be wrong like anyone else. One physician is just one person's opinion.

0.880000	Relates well personally and spends time talking and suggesting best care.  History of experience in their medical speciality.

0.880000	My doctor takes time and listen to what's going on with me. Takes time and doesn't rush. Takes time to explain
0.800000	i trust my doctor to make the best decisions about my health. we have developed a good partnership over the years.

0.800000	I trust my care provider she has been very understanding and very helpful with my needs she has also called my house with different concerns which is unusual for doctors to do nowadays

0.960000	    I trust my family doctor completely because he is thorough and complete in ALL of his medical dealings with me. He answers my questions and asks me questions too. If I need a specialist, he knows which ones are better than average and will tell me who to see.
0.680000	I trust them because they went to school for being a doctor or physician I don't trust them because of the reason they push lots and lots of medicine on people when the main thing they need to tell the patient is to eat healthy and stop being sedentary 
0.800000	I recently had a serious leg injury and surgery and she has been in contact with me almost daily to check on me and make sure I have what I need to get better.  She also makes sure that I am doing the things I need to do for the rehab of my knee and wrist to get full function back.
0.720000	He pays attention to detail.  He recommends another doctor if a specialist is needed without hesitation.  He is in the loops if I need to go to specialist.  He does not horse,around about giving medicine that will do the job.
0.440000	I don't trust doctors because when I had my son they gave me to much blood pressure meds, which cause my blood pressure to drop uncomtrolably with out stoping so much to the point where I need oxygen 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physicians because they are honest & upfront with me. They don't tell me what I want to hear.
0.800000	No matter what my condition was or is mu primary care physician was able to make a correct diagnosis 100% of the time.

0.920000	My primary care physician spends a lot of time with me.  He has even come in on his day off to see me.  He listens to my opinions, respects them, and is open in discussing issues with me.
0.800000	he is willing to work with me and try other ways instead of adding more medicine that would be more harmful then helpful
0.600000	It is not that I distrust my primary care doctor but that I am fully aware they are human and humans make mistakes and or tend to miss things that aren't obvious so I am a strong advocate in believing in my gut and getting a second opinion if I have any doubts 
0.520000	Doctors make extra money by referring to other doctors and by prescribing certain medicines. That is counter to my best interests. I take what the doctor recommends with a grain of salt.
0.840000	I basically trust doctors because they have more knowledge than I do. I do not completely trust anyone.  If my doctor says or suggests something I do not agree on I will question her. If I ever feel I can't trust my doctor I will find a new doctor
1.000000	My doctors are very aware of my physical circumstances and listen to any objections I have. We agree together as to what is needed. If I have an objection, they willingly listen to me and change things.
0.600000	I trust my primary. I believe they would never tell me nothing wrong, or give me something that's not good for me. An the same goes for my kids. I have trust in my primary doctor, and believe he/she will not harm me and my family.

0.680000	I generally trust medical professionals, but I know that they are also humans with their own self-interests.
0.840000	i trust my doctor because she takes her time with me to find out what is best for me. she also gives me advice on what kind of medications that would be good for my condition
0.880000	I have been with him for over 10 years and we have developed a trust. If I had to find a new doctor, I would have a hard time finding one that I have the same kinds of relationship with.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I trust her to know mainstream illnesses such as flu, colds, strep, UTIs, etc.  I would not have full confidence in her medical knowledge in more rare or extreme illnesses due to her age and lack of experience - she is barely 30 years old.  Also, I fully research any recommendations to verify her information.
0.680000	i trust him because he's a physicaian in the professional and medical field,he,s never steered me in the wrong direction that i can prove if anything to prove he is a kindhearted peson and really cares about his patients
0.480000	feel that she is rushed and doesn't have the time to address my concerns. i'd like to try a different type of a medication and also manage my chronic conditions better
0.920000	I have been seeing the same doctor for 13 years, we have the same medical condition so we have a great repore.
0.720000	My primary is kind and caring.  She is also educated and thorough in her practices.  She makes me and my opinions matter.
0.640000	My doctor has a lot of patients so she has to see them all she might miss something I need medically 
0.320000	i have little trust in doctors.I have had to fire them because of their care less and evil verbal abuse.When give detailed testing procedures I had to refuse the action as it was a sure failure and would spread the current infection.I was offered perscriptions that were incorrect.I knew what would work but the doctor did not know for one month.Had I not been able to deal with the infection I would lost a life.
0.520000	"Medicine is now practiced by rote. The ""average"" person will accept the off-the-cuff surface diagnosis.  I'm not one of those people. As my mother pointed out years ago, presidents, kings, and doctors, all put their pants on one leg at a time. I only accept the ""Gospel truth"" from the Gospel."
0.800000	I have been with them for years and they have a great practice and have never made me second guess anything that they have done. I actually need to go back.
0.680000	He does take the time to pay attention to me and answer my questions.  He is about ready to retire and I am saddened about that.  These EHR mandates are a source of trouble for him
0.640000	my primary care physician helped save my life, he was able to find, diagnose and treat an illness that could have killed me
0.640000	I feel that they are in a hurry sometimes, and i get the feeling it is about the money, and  they are too quick to perscribe pills instead of trying other treatments first
0.640000	I trust them, She isVery in tune with me. She listens to me, she takes her time.  She doesn't rush you through and not listen
0.760000	I have been with my doctor fer a lot of years as well as he was my fathers doctor. He is more then competent as well as being a trusted source of medical needs and advice.
0.600000	I've known him a long time and he usually answers all of my questions honestly and truthfully. He is always available when I need him.
0.800000	We have a great dialogue with  each other. He seems to actually listen to me, unlike other doctors in my past.
0.520000	I don't completely trust my doctor because I don't feel like I can trust any doctor after previous experiences with bad doctors. However, I feel like my doctor genuinely wants to help me and cares about what happens to me, I just don't think they always tell me what my best option of treatment is all the time, etc.
0.600000	My primary care doctor has changed 3 times in the last year.  I totally trust my gynecologist and cardiologist.  Sometimes doctors want to charge insurance companies for additional testing.  Sometimes they don't want to tell you that you should maybe see a different specialist.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has been around for many years and has the experience in treating pretty much everything. 
1.000000	always trust my doctor all the time and he totally helps me take care of myself and my family all the time
0.600000	I trust them because I have been going there for a long time and like all of them and know they would do anything for me and my health.
0.760000	Sometimes I feel my clinical doctors are overwhelmed with too many patients and just skim the chart of the patient before him. His skimming the page can hardly relay too much confidence on said patient. 
0.800000	I distrust the doctor sometimes because I'm unable at times to get proper medicine I need for pain. However, I do trust the doctor with filling me in on information about my health.
0.760000	I have known my doctor for years, he takes care of my family and know and trust him to make careful and thoughtful decisions concerning my health.
0.600000	I've known too many doctors to do things in a rush. I wish they would of sat and had  a conversation with me, instead of telling me what needed to be done, cause some things aren't actually necessary. 
0.960000	I completely trust my primary care because I left his practice for 1 year many years ago and I got very sick. And the new doctor could not help me.. I went back to him and stayed and told him I would not leave again. It been over 25 years.

0.600000	Often times its feels as if the primary care physicians, allergists, and other doctors will sometimes make things worse than what they really are at the time. Sometimes it is like they want the patient to spend more money out of pocket and constantly come back for nothing.

0.760000	I don't have any reason not to trust them. I haven't had any issues come up because I've trusted and taken their advice in the past. I don't think they would tell me false information.
0.720000	well Trust is, of course, essential to both physician and patient. Without trust, how could a physician expect patients to reveal the full extent of their medically relevant history, expose themselves to the physical exam, or act on recommendations for tests or treatments? Trust promotes efficient use of both the patient's and the physician's time. Without trust, the process of informed consent for the most minor of interventions, even a prescribed antibiotic, would become as time consuming as that needed for major surgery.rust may even have therapeutic value, enhancing the efficacy of prescribed treatment.22 Most importantly, trust in the doctor caring for them is of great importance to patients. Patients who trust their doctors rate their care more favorably, as demonstrated by Keating et al.23 in this issue, as well as by others.20,24 Numerous open-ended studies of patients' views about their care, in a variety of contexts, most of which did not include specific hypotheses about trust, have found that patients spontaneously discuss trust and its importance, adding

0.880000	Doctor  John Smith in Springfield is my doctor. He is the kindest and considerate person I have ever had as a doctor. The one I had before was Jane Doe, she was mean rude and could care less about me. She should never have become a doctor. She hates people, I was not the only person that she mistreated.
0.560000	Doctors are human and as such are not above making mistakes and missing things that should have been observed and so we have to remember this and question things along the way.
0.800000	I'm neutral about some docters and physicians. They can tell you what they think is goo for you but then things can turn out to be bad for you. For instant my wife had high blood pressure. Her blood pressure is always high and she is on medication. They have switched her medicine about 4 times saying that the next one will help, which neither one has helped. I don't that everything they say and everything they supply to you.

0.520000	I do not trust one of my physicians because even though I feel pain I always get the feeling that because they know nothing is broken I shouldn't be in pain or as much pain as I say I am.

0.840000	She always has sound advice about my health whether I like it or not. I am able to use the same doctor for all my needs.

0.760000	My doctor appears to be genuinely concerned about my well-being based on their mannerism. They are always open to suggestions and takes the time and effort to answer my questions and clear up any confusions I might have.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician or regard to doctors in general because they are doctors and suppose to be trusted they hold information that is very private and personal to us and have to be trusted because of such. She's also kind. 
0.720000	I generally trust doctors to offer their best insights based on their knowledge and experience, which far surpasses mine as it relates to general health concerns. So I am open-minded enough to entertain any advice they offer. However, I'm also assertive enough to make my own thoughts and questions known so that together, hopefully, we determine the best plan for my personal health. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he knows all the right meds I should be on and what I should do and not do . He always answers all my questions I have and makes sure I am always okay .

0.640000	Some doctors are good and some are not so good. They are just in it for the money. I really wish there were better doctors. 
0.480000	In general all human beings (including physicians) share a margin of error potential.  Therefore, I do not blindly place explicit trust in any person.  It is important for all consumers who are able to act as their own advocate to assume this responsibility. Second opinions and thorough research should be considerations used to influence these personal decisions.

0.640000	I do have a primary care doctor, and generally I trust his advice but sometimes doubt that he is giving me all the information I need about certain situations.
0.440000	in 1998 a Dr said I had breast cancer.  He cut my breast off and took out 11 lymphnodes   He got the records mixed up and gave me surgery for someone with stage 4 cancer.  I now have immune system problems and lymphodemia.  He gave me 5 years to live.  Before this the Dr was always right.  I approach Dr's like I do Medicine, with caution.  Only if I really, really need it.  
0.760000	With all the schooling and expenses doctors have to pay in medical school I would hope they enjoy what they are doing. I trust my doctor because that is their profession and I feel comfortable with their decisions 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because when I tell her what problems im having she'll tell me what medication could be the problem and have me reduce it or take me off of it and i no longer have that problem 
0.600000	I have not been given any reason not to trust my physician. She is willing to hear my concerns and prescribe necessary medication based on her assessment of what is wrong.
0.400000	I think that with any doctor I will have some distrust from their patients, because its a money making business. I think that how much income a doctor generates definitely has an impact on the amount care that the doctor provides. I personally often have these distrusting feelings but I also have no problem asking questions for clarification.  I will object to something that I disagree with and I will go else where for treatment.
0.480000	It the medicine that I have to take it is a simulated and because of that I have to suffer they don't believe another me to see strength doses I have came to her two time try get her to gave me the help needed seemed to me that I am faced impossible odd
0.600000	Well doctors are humans as well, and they make mistakes, which is why I have a general neutral stance when it comes to doctors. I believe they do what's right for the most part, but it's possible they're forgetful as well.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she's always looking out for me and she now also is my child's doctor and I trust her completely with him as I do myself.

0.720000	I trust my doctor but through past experience I know that doctors sometimes make bad decisions that can end up in devastating circumstances. They often have support so should not make snap decisions without consenting other doctors and nurses.
1.000000	I went through a few doctors before my current doctor. So I have a lot of confidence in both my doctors, I have to see a neurologist and my primary doctor.  The first neurologist actually admitted to me that she didn't know much about my condition so therefore I had no confidence in her at all.
0.600000	I kinda both distrust and trust. But the reason why i distrust is because i feel like they dont want to actually look into the problem. its like they have to diagnois you with something even its wrong. and then on to the next person. its like they have so many people that they dont really care about whats happening with you. 
0.680000	None and I'm dong okay and I have nothing to say as for right now and I really don't have no answer for this question that you are asking me

0.680000	I don't fully trust one of my primary care doctors  because my bills are always really high. It's like she just orders every test she can possibly find even though it's not necessarily needed. If you tell her you don't do well with certain meds she'll say that she thinks they're better than the kind you do well with.
0.720000	My doctor is a no nonsense person. She tell it to you like it is and do not hesitate to explain why your ailment is what it is

0.920000	I trust my doctor because he knows what's best for me, more than I know what's best for myself. As a trained Juliard physician who has a better understanding & working knowledge of the human anatomy, along with eight years of attending the best schools on a person's overall physical, mental or emotional health, I can rest in knowing that I can put my trust, and ultimately my life, in the hands of one who's more highly qualified as what's best for my continuing to live a long and healthy life.

0.800000	I have an integrated health doctor. This one has been the best fitted for me. She listens to my concerns and we try alternative options before going straight to prescription meds. 
0.760000	I don't trust or distrust them. I think they give the best advice they can, but ultimately it's up to me to decide what to do.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because of the treatment and the way my doctor explain things to me. Also because of the way that we talk about things that we have in common.
0.600000	I trust my doctor to s point but when I'm recommended medicines that I know I don't need I feel as if I can't trust him.
0.600000	There are some doctors that will go out of there way to help a patient and then there are some that are of no help at all. I have encountered both in my lifetime especially when it comes to dealing with my children's health issues. 
0.760000	My doctor is very caring, and makes me feel confident about treatments he suggests.  When you go in you feel more like a family member than a patient.  He doesn't rush he is thorough and he can't get answers he'll refer you somewhere that can

0.400000	Well the doctor I go to mainly focuses on my weight for my age and height but not taking into consideration that I have muscle. So her main focus at the visit is to call me fat and say I need to lose weight.    
0.600000	I just dread goin to see a doctor for anything cause I don't like bad health news. if its all the same I would rather have no news than bad news

0.480000	My main issue is how doctors are educated and their over reliance on pharmaceutical drugs. In my experience it is the rare doctor who takes the time to actually diagnose a problem rather than putting a 'band aid' on itin the form of some prescribed drugs.
0.920000	Their job Is to keep you alive if they fail that then that's a loss of life on their hands. Their completly trained for eight years to be doing what their doing

0.320000	I do not have a strong amount of trust in any doctor. Doctors often lie or leave out information pertaining to medical information, in order to make their money. For example, doctors are aware of how dangerous kemo and radiation are, but they continue to sale it to patients.

1.000000	My doctor is confident and knowledgeable. He listens intently and compassionately. Doesn't prescribe a lot of unnecessary testing. Has been right on the mark with his diagnoses so far.

Every challenge I have encountered rendered very positive results thus far. Although I am also aware that my doctor is not perfect and is very capable to error.

0.640000	When the physician is new I trust them because there brain is fresh from studying and learning new stuff , but sometimes I feel like they might be a little bit nervous and they might make a mistake , for explain giving me the wrong drugs.

0.600000	I feel that, similar to lawyers, medical professionals will sometimes look to profit instead of wanting the best service for their customer.

1.000000	My docotor is an amazing woman and she helps me all the time when I'm sick and also gives me advise to walk in her shoes 
0.480000	He doesn't always look into what is wrong with me.  He just assumes. I'll tell him what it wrong with me and he will say oh well it sounds like this and that but doesn't do any kid of tests at all. Thats not OK to hold someone's life in their hands

0.760000	I only have a mild distrust of doctors because of some experiences my mother has had working with them, but on the whole I have had extremely kind and patient primary care physicians.

0.640000	Sometimes when I'm sick, I go in and they give me one medication. My condition sometimes stays the same and sometimes gets worse, so I go back in and they give me a different medication.

0.800000	I've been a patient of my doctor for some time and we have developed a very good doctor patient relationship. If I do not feel comfortable with something she informs me of then I question it and vice-versa.
