0.688900	I feel that I can understand and process basic health information well but obtaining it is more difficult.

0.838900	As far as basic information goes I'm fully confident I have the ability to understand what my doctors tell me. However if there's any serious issues I'll typically do my own research at home on the internet about the condition.

So I would say that I take the reigns in making sure my healthcare needs are taken care of  
0.888889	I feel I'm capable of getting basic information outside of what my physican/nurse has explained(my own research), put that together with what I understand from my doctor to come up with an understanding of what's going on with my health.  That in addition to discussing with family/friends who may have experienced similar conditions I can obtain a cohesive understanding of my issue.

0.833300	I believe that I have a good understanding of the medical field as my wife is a nurse and I also have a background in IT.  Since the body tends to work like a computer and much of the same logic can be applied in different ways, I believe that I am a person who can understand how different parts of the body may interact with each other.  Also, taking the time to understand the body, which is our survival tool is very important and everyone should have a basic understanding of certain medical terms and logic.

0.916700	I've had a few operations and have taken care of a parent with Alzheimer's. While I have a pretty severe phobia of all things medical, I've had enough urgent care to know the ropes and even a lot about interl organs/functions as well as pharma and tural medicine.

0.772200	I feel that I have the overall capacity to obtain and process my health information but the emotional and time pressured environment of healthcare appointments impedes my ability to do so. For routine care it doesn't matter so much, but when there is a problem with your health or someone you love and you only have 15 minutes to discuss it things can get overwhelming and confused.

0.544400	Yes and no. Some times i feel like i am not allowed to ask questions as the doctors act like they are above you and seem to get irritated when i ask questions to try and understand. they like to speak in terms i don't know the definitions to and seem unwilling to explain further. the last time i went to the hospital i asked the doctor to explain why i was having so much  pain she gave me an answer  i did not understand and said can you explain it a little better and asked how long should i expect the pain and was told by her that she already explained it the best she could.

I often feel rushed or intimidated by my medical staff and do not speak up to ask the proper questions, or I become so overwhelmed by the dismissive or hurried mood they have that I sit quietly instead of taking up more of their time.  Sometimes things don't make sense and I am too passive to speak up and say anything, and then often have to research it at home myself, which leaves me wondering if I am finding the correct information or not.

0.477778	I really do not have very much confidence in official medical visits. It always takes a long wait in the waiting room. although I drive on time even a little early, there is always a long wait in the waiting room before I am called. There is unsanitary conditions from people who have coughs. the magazines are also dripping with germs from other patients. By the time I am called to the second waiting room(the doctor,s office I am again sitting for at least 30 minutes. I am thinking at the time that I could get other errands done. When the Doctor or Nurse practitioner comes I am tired and frustrated from waiting tah I want to get the hell out of there. The questions I ask are minimal and I can't think of anything else. Unless I write down a list before the visit I draw a blank regarding the reason I am even there. The doctor is always late and rushes through the appointment. I can't really remember what the issue and information I receive .  It is a really big hassle If I have to travel to another city. It seems to take all day to get there, see Dr. and travel back home.

0.916667	I HAVEA GREAT ABILITY TO EXPLAIN WHAT I FELL EXACTLY AND I FEEL CONFIDENT WHEN IT COMES TO DIAGNOSES ANY HEALTHY PROBLEM 
0.688900	I am fortunate enough to have a father who was a paramedic, one brother who is a nurse anesthetist, another brother who is a physicians assistant, and a fiance who is attending medical school. I have opportunities to constantly get in contact, ask questions, and have multiple opinions on a single matter. This being said, I utilize this perk often, as many times I do not understand or get proper answers from medical professionals at offices, hospitals, and urgent care centers. There are times that I feel as though words are purposely being used to go over my head about things, to avoid detection of a unsure opinion. I don't normally have problems understanding material and pill descriptions, just on occasion, problems with the professionals themselves, and their explanations.

I may not be able to do so immediately, but with the help of the internet and my wife who is a nurse, I am confident I can understand just about anything I may need to go over with a doctor (non-specialist). Most people can't answer all their own medical questions and I don't think it's fair for anyone to be able to answer medical questions without being given adequate time to look into the questions.

Sometimes doctors don't want to give direct answers because, I believe, they are afraid of lawsuits or my claiming they said something they did not. I would like it if they would put everything in simple language so that everyone could understand exactly what they're talking about. 
0.850000	I have been filling out health related information for a long time. Not only for myself but my husband, children, and siblings. I know to ask about what I do not understand because it could be reason for a misdiagnosis
0.900000	I feel that I am quite capable since I consider the scientific research method to be the basis for my reasoning.

The problem I feel with healthcare is too many patients and not enough doctor/patient time to sit down and discuss things unless you make an appointment for just that. 
0.627778	I have the ability to understand and read the material about 70%.  Problem is most of it is written in small print which is very difficult to read and the words themselves are not user friendly.  As for the doctor himself - usuallyl they are to busy.

I also now have a pharmacy that I use, whose workers are also always willing to answer any slight questions that I may have. I have access to these physical people, as well as the Internet in order to gain information about anything else that I don't understand. I'll use it sometimes to check basic drug interactions that I can't remember, such as Tylenol and Aleve, or other such over the counter medications.

0.605600	Sometimes I think doctors don't explain everything outright like they should in laments terms. They don't always give adequate resources and it feels like you're taking up too much of their valuable time if you ask too many questions.

0.777800	First of all, I usually will do some major indepth investigation upon my own to examine the facts, and then compare to what my medical staff is telling me, or suggesting that I do in their care. I absolutely do not put all of my faith in any one doctor or health professional, as many are simply wrong, or just doing what they are told to do by their superiors, which often is in the best interest of the pharmacutical and insurance companies. We as patients are sold to the highest bidder who then have control over our medical decisions. The outcome of my life is of no concern to these corporate entities, only the bottom line which determines the lowest cost factor for them, and the highest profit margins for the pharmacutical companies which the insurance provider can accept.

0.705600	I think that in general I am able to get the help that I need in understanding health information and services. At the hospitals that I go to, quite often the information that the doctor conveys is backed up by written reading material. My main trouble comes with pharmacy medications. It is not always clear how to go about taking it - for example, suppose I want to switch from taking something in the evening to taking it in the morning, can I do that? Additionally,  suppose I suspect something is a side effect of pill X, then i hate going online to figure it out because its just not the same as seeing a doctor.

Often I find that times have changed and new information is available that I didn't know about.
0.916667	I can fully understand process and obtain what I'm being told by a doctor or nurse. If it's a decision dealing with me, I am fully capable of deciding what needs to be done with me.

0.788900	I feel that I am capable of digesting most information.  I'm computer literate and I do look up terminology that I don't understand and my daughter-in-law is an RN and works in the ER and she's a good resource for me.  I use the patient portals corresponding to my doctors and these have helpful information as well.

0.833300	I think I understand any written material and forms I am given.  Occasiolly I have trouble asking doctors questions because I usually recall them after its too late and the appointment is over.  At that point I usually try to find the answer on the internet.

My physician will explain my illness and the treatments options when the tests results came out. Of course, I may ask any questions to my doctor.

0.788900	"I feel pretty educated on my health conditions and feel confident in my doctors.  However, there are times when I still don't feel I have all the information I need to make health decisions.  Often, doctors are unable to ""dumb down"" language to the point where a lay person could understand.  Additionally, I feel that my time with doctors is limited.  I rarely feel that I have had as much time as I wanted.  Insurance forms are also very difficult to understand.  I almost feel like I need to have a lawyer look over everything!  Often the receptionists do not seem educated in health language."

I make sure I understand what I need to before I leave the office as I want to make sure I get better and don't do anything to make my condition worse.  I try not to use things like webMD or other things on the computer and just listen to my doctor.  I don't want to get any false information or confuse myself.  I trust my primary health physician as he has been right in the past and has helped me get over a few things with no complications and fairly quickly in all instances as well.  He goes over any documents or directions with me before I leave so I can ask questions and so he knows I understand everything.  
0.716700	I feel fairly confident. I am not a doctor or expert but I am not intimidated either.
0.672200	I feel like its possible to find the information that I need online. When I go to the doctor, I always feel like it's rushed and they just make a diagnosis and then want to leave as soon as possible, not really having any concern for any questions that you may have. I don't like this part about it. 
0.916700	I have wonderful doctor that is down to earth and the Health clinic I go to makes it easy to understand what they need from me. I think it comes down to communication and at the places I get my physicals etc they are very competent and helpful.

0.588900	I feel I have a capacity to learn the information ,but it is difficult due to the wording , and the way the medical information is presented. If I had better resources and someone to  explain some of the working I feel I would have not problems finding out that information

My mother is a nurse so I always have someone to ask and I write down all my questions before I go so I don't get nervous and just say ""it is fine"" like I used to.

I have decent insurance and it gives me a better chance to go to the doctor and get what I need. "
0.633300	I feel that I my ability to understand basic health information is a 100%. I often feel that my doctors don't spend enough time explaining to me, what my condition is which makes me feel that they don't understand my condition very well at all.

0.538900	I feel that some doctors could be better at explaining medical conditions in a way that normal people can understand it. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what they mean, but occasiolly I am too embarrassed to ask what they mean exactly. In that case I will look it up myself later. I realize that it would be better to actually ask the doctor, because the internet is not always the most reliable place to find information. So I feel that I do have the capacity to get the information, but I don't always do it because I feel intimidated by some doctors.
0.844400	I feel fairly confident. Sometimes though I don't feel like I have enough of the doctor's time to ask all the questions I want or to receive all the explanations I need. Some things I need repeated because they're complex but I don't always feel like there's time for notes and repetitions.
0.850000	I have the mental capacity of understanding my basic health info and services. Usually my doctor and nurses are pretty reliable.

I often have my husband present with me for a second set of ears so we can both discuss our understanding afterwards.
0.633300	Sometimes I do. When they start giving probabilities and percentages, I start to lose them though. I prefer black and white explations. 
0.688900	I think I have the ability to communicate with my doctor and explain to him the things that are going on. Whether it is headaches or some other problem, I can give him the symptoms and he takes it from there. I can then listen to what he says and ask follow up questions.

0.827778	I generally understand everything discussed about my health issues. when I don't understand, I ask for more information until I do understand.
0.866700	If I don't understand something I ask questions about it until I feel that I understand what they're saying. Sometimes they can get rude about it but for the most part doctors and nurses take the time to make me understand. 
0.505556	I feel like I need to ask more questions concerning my conditions because sometimes I do not since I feel very uncomfortable asking. The doctor needs to make sure we understand our medicine at all times. This does happen more of the times but not all.

0.833333	i don't have health problems, nor do anyone in my family so we have not experienced anything complicated to understand
0.500000	about 60% of the time I can understand; the rest of the time I have to ask questions.. I am not a real tech minded type of person and I often have to rely on professional  people for assisstance.
0.655556	I feel that I'm not familiar with medical theme, I've never used any hospital services during my life in the USA
0.855600	I have great capacity to obtain process and understand basic health info to make appropriate decisions. I ask a lot of questions and make sure the Dr. understands what issues I am having so that I get the best care. I also follow up with the Dr. if I forget to say something about my issues etc. It gets a little murky when the Dr. decides to go down one path and I am not totally clear why, or if I received different info from the same Dr.
0.800000	I am of sound mind and I can understand what I being told or what I am reading. If i don't understand what I'm being told I will ask the right questions if I don't get the answers I need I will get a second opinion.

I don't believe in a lot of the western concept idea of ""diseases"" and have been focusing more on getting my health back without pharmaceuticals by eating clean, vegan whole foods diet. And it's working. I don't need doctors to tell me about shill information or services that we'll find out 50 years later was all wrong, like how doctors recommended cigarettes. Only time I'd need a doctor is in an emergency."
0.855556	i feel confident in making health decisions. Recently I have been to quite a few doctors office. I was sure to tell them everything they needed to know in order to figure out what has been going on with me
0.872200	I feel that I can express myself in such a manner that health professionals will understand my condition. I think I can describe my symptoms well enough such that a doctor or a nurse will be able to recommend ways to help me feel better. I also think that I understand what I need to do when a doctor gives me instructions on how to treat my symptoms.
0.716700	I feel I have a decent capacity to make health decisions. If I need help or advice, I can ask friends or family. I can also look up information on the internet, search through forums, and research what others have done when in similar situations.
0.622222	It is very important to understand basic health information, so that you can make appropriate health decisions. You should have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic information.

0.850000	Fully capable of obtaining, processing and understanding  of basic health information and can make good health decisions

0.750000	i can usually catch on to information and try to follow directions as best I can it's just not always easy to do everything....no one is perfect
0.688900	I feel for the most part I either understand the material or think that I can look up the information that I don't understand.  I feel that I have good judgment for the most part and probably make wise decisions regarding my health, and would if I needed to.
0.450000	I can read the information but sometimes I don't remember anything that I read it makes me upset I guess my mom mind is not as sharp as it used to be as I get older
0.883333	I know my body and what I am  feeling. My doctor knows me and my trust lies in him..He has to be a detective to find my health issues by what I tell him. The more info I give him, the easier and quicker it is to diagnose  whats wrong 
0.794400	I am currently a college student and decently educated in biology and chemistry, along with anthropology. While none of these things alone would help me very much, the combination of them I feel gives me a pretty good understanding of basic medical information. I can usually understand what a condition or illness is doing, or why, at its core. 
0.883300	Knowing a few people in the health care industry and finding it interesting myself, I feel very confident with health information. The internet can further help obtain information that I find questioble. 
0.633333	If I don't understand I'll just research and google for understanding. A lot of times the medical terms throw us off so I try to ask them to explain in more details what they mean. If I still don't understand, I'll google the issue. So I somewhat understand to make appropriate health decisions, but I always try to research on my own before making a decision.
0.883300	I have complete confidence in my own understanding of healthcare.  I have the highest degree of capacity, in my opinion, to understand and make my own healthcare decisions.  My understanding goes beyond basic health information and services.  I have cared for sick family members.  I have worked in the healthcare field.  I ask questions and look up information as necessary.
0.900000	I feel I understand it quite well. If I have a question I don't hesitate to ask someone. Some of it can be confusing at times, always ask if uncertain. So far in me life I have had no problems understanding and processing health information.

0.900000	I'm quite able to ask questions that I might have about my medical needs and understand what is explained.  If there is any other questions that I have, I don't hesitate to ask.  Also when I get have time, I research online the information that I was given and if there is another option, I bring that up with my doctor.
0.672222	I feel as if I am not the most qualified person to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make healthy decisions, but I am not the least either.
0.688900	Generally speaking, I can process what the doctor or nurse give me, after a consultation. If there is something I can't grasp, I ask additional questions.  Most of the times, the health professionals speak in plain English, so there is usually no ambiguity. 
0.522222	 Regarding doctors papers documents all of those things I need help with .. some papers and some documents I can do and read on my own but some I need help with ....

0.794400	I feel like for the most part I can read and figure something out. Now when it comes to not knowing something I have a awesome doctor who is willing to put it in terms that I understand and who will explain it to me.

0.916700	I feel like I am competent enough to ask the questions that I have to the medical professionals. If I don't understand the answer I will ask them to explain it better.
0.677800	I am very in-tune with my own physical and mental health, and when I believe there is an issue I need to discuss with a doctor I seek out the appropriate resources. The internet is a wonderful tool to research different things and determine the right questions to ask. I also work in the medical field so I understand the logic and reasoning of doctors. So when I am told something about my own health, and if I don't understand any aspect of what I'm told, I know to ask them t explain in a different way until I can make an informed decision.
0.916700	I feel I definitely know how to get all information effectively. I speak fluent English, consider myself intelligent, and have taken plenty of science courses.

0.794400	I feel confident that I am able to comprehend health information provided by my doctors. If there is anything I don't understand, I feel comfortable asking my healthcare providers for an explation. Availability and ease of communication is one of the things I look for when choosing a doctor. 
0.850000	Somewhat a little from a doctor. I recently went to see a doctor and their diagnosed wasn't very helpful. They spent less than 5 minutes for a $100 charge. 
0.844444	I have been dealing with medical issues for years about myself, my children and my parents and my husband's parents and himself.   That is what the mom always does
0.861111	I think I understand most of the information that is said to me and feel capable of understanding everything that is being told to me
0.666700	I believe I can fairly easily obtain basic health information.  Processing and understanding the information is usually a little harder but with the help of the internet, friends, and family I can usually figure out what I need to.  
0.883333	I feel I have the experience and education to understand basic health information. I am able to research or ask questions, if necessary, to help in making appropriate health decisions.
0.916667	I may be 74 years old, but so far, my mental capacity is excellent. Of course, it's easy to find out more information nowadays if one needs to do so simply by using the Internet.

0.872222	I have full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions as long as the doctor answers all my questions that I ask once given an answer.
0.627778	the information given to you by the doctor or the nurse is very important because they gives the complete picture to make any decisions related to health services
0.916700	I am fully capable of processing information from a health professiol.  I am also good at looking up symptoms and I usually am good at figuring out what is wrong.  (For example, my husband had a blood clot in his leg, but I looked it up before he went to the doctor and told him it looked as if it was a superficial clot, and it turned out that is what the doctor said.)  I know that I can go to the doctor for more information when necessary and I know I can get second opinions with serious health concerns. 
0.866667	I am still able to make my own health decisions. Fortunately I am in good health. I go to the doctor a couple of times a year, eat healthy, am not over weight and exercise every day.
0.727778	I feel a great deal of need to understand basic health information so that i will be making an informed decision about my health and treatment.
0.594400	A basic level of ability.  The forms and all are confusing at times and sometimes I feel awkward discussing things with a doctor that I don't know that well.  
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of coming up with good questions, asking those questions, doing independent research, and understanding information I receive in order to make good health decisions for myself.
0.783300	I feel that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make health decisions because I tend to use research online. When I have follow up questions I will look for scholarly websites and articles explaining what I need to know. I do find it hard to ask the doctor a question after I have left so I take the learning in my own hands.
0.777800	I have the utmost ability to do what I must to understand every facet of any health related issues I have, before I go to a medical professional I tend to make notations of questions I might have on my smartphone memo app for reference during consultations/visits. I also ask for any external resources online that I can review/read to help me understand, also I am not concerned about asking the same question to different specialists/medical professionals in order to ensure I have obtained accurate information. As well as needing help with forms/directions/instructions there are usually a myriad of staff members who are always read to help.
0.883300	I try to be as open and honest with my health care provider as I can. When I visit the health care provider I accept the fact that in the end they are the expert in the field. I may have some limited knowledge and will give what little I know and ask questions based on that. However, I look to them as the person who can best understand and explain things. It is their field of expertise and seek them for their knowledge and help.
0.572200	I feel like I have good ability to understand written health information, but often get confused or feel under-informed when speaking directly to doctors or nurses. I often do not feel comfortable to ask the questions I need to in order to understand fully what health decisions I need to make. 
0.916667	I make sure that I understand if not I ask questions. Regarding medicine procedures and any surgery that has to be performed.
0.716700	I am really certain that I can get the information that I may need to understand what health decisions that I have to make. 
0.583333	It's depending on which type of health issues I have so I have procedures to follow for each problem
0.600000	I feel like it depends, about 50-50. There are times when it is difficult for me but sometimes its okay. There have been a few times when people have had to fill out my documents. 
0.916700	"obtain 10/10, I can research or ask them if I can't find it online; process 10/10, like I said, I can search texts for relevant information; understand 10/10, with the caveat that if it's the actual science it'll take a lot longer than if it's just ""treatment x versus treatment y"" type stuff"
0.672200	I usually feel I have the capacity. As a woman I sometimes feel talked down to/not listened to by health professiols, which can frustrate me and make me less likely to be open to talking with doctors, because I feel like they aren't taking me seriously anyway.
0.833300	I feel I am 100% capable of understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services. This is because of years of experience handling my own medical information with no help. 
0.916667	I have basic knowledge of how the body functions and have always researched any medical conditions I or members of my family have had.  I navigated the medical system assisting throughout my father's diabetes, heart disease and cancer.  I am not intimidated by the professionals as I have had to get answers and be vigilant to make sure my family members got the best treatment and that we all understood how to best help throughout the illnesses.
0.900000	I feel I am smart enough to understand all information relating to my medical needs and if I dont will ask questions or research more throughly
0.788900	I feel like I have a good capacity to do so. I fill out the doctor's forms when I go get a physical and I schedule a physical yearly. If anything came up on a physical I'm sure I'd be able to check it out.
0.833333	I feel like I am capable of handling my own basic health information and I am able to make appropriate health decisions 
0.622200	I don't trust insurance companies and I am extremely skeptical of the healthcare industry. Not so much of the doctors although after going to college and seeing future doctors and nurses do blow I am wary of the the future.
0.705556	If I don't understand I ask until I do. Even if that means say that again or can you simplify that. I am  not afraid to ask a question. Especially after something I went through and the doctors couldn't even figure out what it was. Luckily the charity hospital did.
0.688900	Once I receive all of the information, I am usually able to understand it. Most of my problems come from understanding the fincial parts of my condition. Also my condition affects everyone differently, so that always causes distress.
0.783300	I think I am fairly educated and have the capacity to understand basic health information. Additionally, I have friends who are registered nurses that can help me id I have any questions.

The clearer you can be about the requirements, duties, and responsibilities of the job and what kind of person you're looking for, and the better you can represent these in your advertising for the job, the less time you'll have to spend reading applications from inappropriate candidates. The act of developing job descriptions and selection criteria forces you to clarify your thinking about the position, the kind of person you want for it, and the organization itself. Organizations often have to include job descriptions in proposals for new programs or positions. Sometimes, the act of composing the job description changes the whole course of the proposal, as people realize that they can use a position in ways they hadn't considered, or that what they had originally conceived was, in fact, unworkable. A job description can sometimes serve to define a whole program.

0.572200	Well it is all so complicated, not even just the medical information but the information needed to navigate the bureaucracy so that one can begin to have medical coverage and have things set up the right way to afford coverage. Then you have to do not only what is medical best for you based on what the doctors tell you but what works out with your work schedule and is covered by your insurance but often to find these out it is a waiting game. So you might pick one option in the hopes that you are covered but then find out later that you are not. Plus you might have to go out of work depending on what choice you pick and then you don't have a job and that makes future medical even harder. Plus I worry too about changing insurance standards because everyone seems to think that healthcare should be about making money instead of taking care of people. 
0.555600	At times it becomes difficult to understand what is wrong with me and I need multiple explanations to try understand what to do and where to go from there.I feel like I can understand what is happening but only at the bare minimum since I get lost at times when the doctor explains in an understanding where I have no clue what is happening so I need explanations that I can understand. At times I don't have everything to make a health decision.

A lot of the time, I find myself going to Web MD after a visit to try and get more detailed information. Medical professionals are often too busy to take the time and answer you thoroughly and I can tell they are trying to hurry me through the appointment. Some written material I don't read, as it's repetitive and the font is like 1/2 point.  
0.616700	I broke my humeru last year and the doctor recommended surgery, but I declined because I don't have insurance.  I basically kept my doctors visits to a minimum to keep medical costs at a minimum.  Because of this I do feel that I missed out on a lot of feedback that would have been helpful.
0.861100	I have the capacity to make health decisions.  I have some medical background and I am very good a research if I have questions that come up later.
0.866700	I think I have the full capacity to understand basic health information. I've done a lot of reading over the years, and I'm also capable of looking things up online or on my phone if I need to understand it in plain talk and can't get my doctor to explain it.
0.805556	I normally understand quite a bit I try to ask a lot of questions or try to have a family member come to help em understand everything. And when a family member comes they can ask questions that maybe I didn't think about. 
0.916700	I rarely have any issues understanding my doctor or a nurse and if something doesn't make sense to me I ask them to elaborate on what I don't initially understand.  I occasionally have an issue getting in contact with my doctor by phone but it's understandable as he's busy and it's rare that I actually need to contact him anyhow as he tends to explain things well and answer any questions I have during my visits.
0.588889	I sometimes have trouble understanding things and have to have things explained to me in a more simple way.
0.833300	I think that I do pretty good. There is always webmd and the mayo clinic websites.
0.666667	I think it's better to give brochures instead trying to just simply explain so that the patient can go and do some research. Explaining while showing videos are also helpful.
0.711100	I think that I have what it takes to understand the information given to me by my doctor. But there are still times when it is a bit cloudy in trying to understand all the variables. When I don't completely understand the information, I either go to an online forum or ask a friend. 
0.544400	I understand written health information better than verbal. When it is explained to me generally I have to ask them to repeat it to me. Overall,  I understand written information very well.
0.838900	 I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, probably better than average. I say this because I do have a scientific background and enjoy reading and learning about diseases and medical conditions, so if I am told something I don't completely understand, I feel capable of doing the research and filling in any gaps in my understanding. I will also ask a doctor or nurse to clarify what they tell me if something is unclear to me.
0.755556	I understand most things. I generally go to the Dr. because I have an issue hat I've searched the,symptoms on the internet first
0.855556	I am intelligent enough to ask for what I want - it is the doctor I do not trust to keep communication open, answer my questions thoroughly or allow my input in treatment options.
0.900000	I feel I understand the medical info pretty well. Anything I don't understand, I make sure to ask questions about.
0.755600	I am very capable of understanding. I like to ask questions and know what is going on. I don't go to the doctor often, but when I do I find out everything that I possibly can. I like to ask about medications and if I should take them all the time or not. I like to go for physicals and have my blood drawn and tested. I like knowing the results of my blood work and if something is wrong I ask questions.
0.916700	I am entirely capable of understanding basic health information and am confident in my abilities to make health decisions for myself. I am a mentally and emotiolly stable woman in her early 30s.

0.866700	I believe I am able to do all of this.  I feel that I am fairly intelligent.  There have been times when I have been reviewing a medical report of mine where I didn't understand the language.  In that case I googled the information or asked my husband to review if the Dr. was not available.  I ask a lot of questions to my doctor in person, so I don't leave a lot to figure out for myself
0.811100	I think that I have a decent understanding.  If I don't completely understand it I won't ask a ton of questions because I can turn to Google to look up the information.  Most of the time I do this when they step out of the room.  If looking it up leads me to be confused I will then ask questions when they step back into the room.
0.733300	Overall I think that I can usually understand the basic information.  THe problem is when a medical professional uses jargon or terminology that I am not familiar with.  Additionally, it is hard in those cases to even think of the right questions to ask.
0.916667	I am totally capable of answering and receiving information that I need to make any and all decisions
0.688900	I can understand and maintain most of the basic health information on my own. Although sometimes I need a little more explaining from the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. If I donât understand things I will usually ask a question

0.916700	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to make good health decisions. I don't get shy or nervous about asking questions when I feel I don't understand something. Part of a doctors job is to educate and explain things that you may not understand or fully grasp.

0.677778	I believe I have a little bit higher degree of understanding than those around me, such as peers and family members. However, my degree of understanding is probably average or a little higher than average.
0.833300	I have had a diagnosis of Anxiety and Depression for over 20 years so I pretty much understand all that is related to that. I have only in the past 3 years finally been diagnosed correctly with Bipolar Disorder and started treatment. I have had to learn a lot about the diagnosis as well as the new medications, and side effects associated, in these last few years. I am at a point where I understand the basic information regarding the disorder and the medications and have no problem asking my psychiatrist questions about such.
0.916667	I have complete confidence in my ability to make decisions regarding my health . I have the ability to ask questions of a qualified person if deemed necessary.

0.916700	I have had an interest in medicine since childhood, having grown up in my father's pharmacy.  I am the gatekeeper and knowledge authority for my family's healhcare and am fully informed on all their medical conditions.  I have a kong0-standing open relationship with my primary care physician and the specialists I see.  I have also been the primary caregiver for my mother when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and advocated aggressively for her care.
0.666700	I think I have a good grasp, but sometimes the physicians differ in their abilities to convey information in a way that is useful to me as a patient. I find medical forms a challenge as I am dyslexic and also an immigrant. I usually have my husband read them over or fill them out for me.
0.883333	I fully understand.if I have a question I will ask .i don't have a problem asking that's why the medical staff is there to assist 
0.738889	The technical jargon in many forms seems confusing and purposefully difficult to understand. Most people don't understand the medications and the ingredients in them without more personal information
0.783333	I ask a lot questions to know more about the situation for I could better understand everything that is being told to me
0.694400	I understand all health related stuff except for the big medical words that i don't understand. I sometimes need help to learn what my condition is and how to fix it and such. I only need help when they use big  words to explain my conditons. 
0.538900	Most of the time I feel like doctors and nurses are too rushed and I don't want to bother them with things that they seem to think I should already know. Many test results are too complicated to understand anyway and I feel like I could just look them up later instead of wasting their time. 
0.744444	Yes I do when I go to the doctor I understand the information that is given to me and what I've read 
0.866700	I can comprehend almost all written instructions unless their are way too technical. I can hear very well and can drive to various medical facilities to have tests performed when necessary. I have ongoing back issues and have had numerous test performed and everything has always been explained very clearly. I deal with the VA for health care so one can imagine the red tape and mumbo jumbo that is associated with them.
0.888900	I am fully confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information about any condition I have in order to make appropriate health decisions. When I visit my doctor, I always make sure to mention any health problems I'm experiencing.

0.916667	i paid attention to doctor's and nurses when it comes to my health, ask questions about alternative actions.
0.916667	I am extremely capable of reading and comprehending anything I need to read to make appropriate health decisions. If I have questions, I make sure that I ask my doctor anything that is not clear. My health is too important to me to make poor decisions due to ignorance.

0.744400	I PRETTY MUCH UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION BEING GIVING. HOWEVER, SOMETIMES THERE ARE CERTAIN TERMS I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND. I JUST LIKE MAKING SURE ABOUT MY HEALTH, WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT TAKE OR DO AND THE AFFECTS OF THE MEDICINE I TAKE. A LOT OF MEDICATIONS CAUSE SERIOUS SIDE AFFECTS. I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNOW WHAT I AM GETTING INTO.
0.916667	i don't have any issues when it comes to the items being discussed. i am confident i can handle it all.
0.916667	I am able to answer questions or ask if I have a question about medicine ,appoi tments,treatment and forms that need to be read

0.827800	I feel like I have a great amount of capacity when it comes to understanding and processing health information when the wording is in everyday language. When the material use a words I don't really know the meaning to that's when it can get a little confusing. If I know it's information I really need 100 percent understanding on I will most definitely ask the doctor until I comprehend what is asked of me.
0.555600	I know about some procedures dealing with health practices but i dont know everything so i tend to ask questions when i confused.
0.755556	I always ask my doctor what things mean when I do not understand what is talk about. When I go any doctor office I ask what they is saying. I sometimes ask other health people about  things like nurse  drug store.It mean a lot to me that know what's go no with my health.
0.916700	When I became an adult I never needed help filling out forms. My mom always helped me when I was younger understand what information on the forms meant if I had a question.

0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to understand health information. The internet is a wonder resource to learn more about health information and services pertaining to my health decision.

0.716700	I think I have an average understanding about basic health information and services when making health decisions.  For me, it depends on the doctor and whether they take the time to explain in layman's term the information they are trying to convey.  I usually ask questions if I am not sure or now I use the internet to get further information if I do not have someone I know who can explain it. 
0.672200	It takes me some time, but if there's something I need to figure out with regard to my health, I'm usually able to figure it out. Luckily my mother is a family practice doctor, so when I need help understanding health information and services I can usually call her and she'll explain it to me. Sometimes, though, there are things that I don't know and I don't know the right questions to ask to figure it out, so I'm left in the dark. 
0.811100	Before I visit my doctor, I usually call and tell them on the phone, why I need to make an appointment with them. When I get to the doctors office, they also give me a form to fill out. On the form, I have to fill in information regarding why I am there to see the doctor, what kind of symptoms I am experiencing, and for how long.

0.555600	After being given information, whether it is by brochure, verbally, or through a call I always ask the doctor or nurse to state everything in layman's terms for those who do not understand the medical terminology they use. Once they state everything in layman's terms, I repeat back what was stated to ensure I am correct with the information they have provided. 
0.916700	I have no underlying issues with reading comprehension, with memory retention or with medical terminology that would preclude me from understanding basic health information provided to me by a doctor or hospital.

0.627800	I think I have just about average ability. Sometimes the information is overwhelming.

0.644400	I believe I have the understanding to make basic health decisions. However, in the cases where there are specific issues (such as dermatology), they quickly explain the condition you are facing and prescribe some medications (trial and error). Often times, they expect you to remember everything they say in the office. In the slight chance they write something down, it is often only a few words.
0.838900	I think I have a good capacity to understand what I need to make appropriate health sentences. I have a good understanding of what the doctors tell me and I understand most health material I get.
0.855556	I am very involved with my health and the impact that the medical profession has upon it.  I do research and take that information and apply it to what a Dr. recommends and form my own opinion on the information on hand.
0.527778	i don't understand most of it and I don't feel confident in talking to my doctor in fear of looking ignorant 
0.733300	I feel like I have the basic knowledge needed to understand most everyday health information. Yes, some technical terms and ailments may go over my head, but I feel like I know enough where I can make decisions and feel comfortable with them.
0.916667	I have health training, pharmacological training and counseling training, and as a college graduate, and a person of above average intelligence, I am confident in my ability to understand my conditions.
0.872222	I am fully capable of understanding everything and making my own decisions and doing what is needed.
0.761100	I have the capacity to understand what is told to me, though i usually need some things explained a little better, like definitions of some terms used. Also i have a very hard time with listening to anything for very long, so sometimes i have to ask for certain parts to be respoken, as i may have spaced off, or was still on a previous statement thinking about that.
0.811100	I think I generally understand health information. I find doctor's offices pretty intimidating, so I do find that I sometimes forget to ask questions and get clarification. I've started trying to write everything down ahead of time so I don't forget.
0.916667	I feel that I am fully capable to read any document a doctor or nurse gives me pertaining to my health. I can ask any questions that are necessary to them. I can also take any advice or recommendation from a doctor.
0.777800	i have the ability to understand health information said to me or given to me. and i have not had any issues processing information said to me by a nurse or a doctor or health practitioner.
0.866667	I think I am fully capable of understanding basic health decisions and services needed. If ever there is something that I do not understand or something that I do not know how to obtain I always have family members and there is Internet available that will assist me with whatever problem that may arise. 
0.800000	"I'm a very patient and curious person, so even if I encounter something I don't understand, I will do what I can in order to understand it, given enough time. I may not be the smartest person around, but I often make up for that with persistence. I'd consider all but the most complicated of topics within my reach (and those complicated topics out of reach simply due to not having the resources available to me to study them farther). Since the question here is in regard to ""basic health information"", I feel confident in my ability to come to a solid understanding, if needed."
0.850000	I feel like I understand Everything my doctor tells me about any condition I might have. Only 1 time I needed more than 1 time for him to go over something I didn't understand. Filling out certain medical or non medical papers can get a little overwhelming for me, but I either figure that out myself or my husband help me.
0.916700	I feel that I am of sound mind and body and am more than capable of making decision in regards to my health. I usually don't have issues with taking medications as prescribed, always have a good understanding of what I should and shouldn't do for my ailments, and have the capability of seeking out information I don't have. 
0.744400	I feel like I do, but I get nervous when I talk to a doctor or nurse. When that happens, especially if they tell me that something is wrong, I get flustered and forget to ask what it is and all the questions. Then when i call I cant get them or they wont answer questions becuase they are too busy.
0.783300	I feel like I have the ability to be informed about my health decisions. If the doctors can't explain it well enough then I can always look it up online.
0.850000	"I feel that I can process and understand basic health information.  But the doctor needs to give me the information in ""plain English"" not in medical terms"
0.883300	I feel i am above average in my understanding of health care and health care related issues, also i have a decent understanding of some basic biology which makes understanding a lot of issues more intuitive. I like to ask pertinent questions and try to challenge the doctor when i am experiencing an illness, and usually by the time i am talking to a doctor i have a list of questions i have derived from my own research before the appointment, many times my guess to the diagnosis proves to match that of the doctor. Sometimes even when the doctor disagrees and offers his own diagnosis in the end my guess proves to be correct after some trial and error.  
0.577800	I have an okay time with it all. Not the best but I try and see things through.
0.672222	I'm not a good game but it in a good game but if you can do meet you at work get my theme song you can do it in a few you about the pantry working on you
0.888889	I have never had an issue with asking for clarification from a medical professional. Generally, the doctors I use clearly explain your condition and give you time to respond.
0.777800	I feel like I have a high degree of understanding of medical issues and what my Doctors are telling me. I am also not afraid to ask questions, if I don't understand or only partially understand. I like to take a piece of paper with questions written down with me to my apt if i have things i am curious about or don't understand. And when a doctor is telling me something I will stop them if I don't understand something. I'm not a doctor so I don't have to understand things, thats why i have a doctor and why it's important to ask questions when they are explaining things!
