-1	Because I been hearing a lot of stuff about doctors nowadays and I really don't like doctors and they make me nervous 
1	I trust them because they have more knowledge and experience to handle my problems based on their training and hands on experience.
-1	I like that my primary care physician usually presents me with multiple courses of action to take for different problems (i.e. different medications).  However, it comes across as being a little indecisive sometimes when I'd rather have a straight yes or no kind of answer.  He also is quick to recommend a specialist instead of giving a medical opinion himself. Overall I think he is trustworthy, though maybe overly cautious.
-1	i feel he had lack of interest in me sometimes and rushes me and also does not have the answers i need to help
-1	My physician is always in a hurry and sometimes doesn't take the time to listen or to explain things to me. I have considered finding another physician for this reason.
-1	His office is extremely busy, seeing patients every 15 min. or so.  So times I don't feel we've solved a particular issue I'm having.  They are also very lax at getting  paperwork done in a timely manner sometimes...I feel like I need to stay on top of things there.
1	I have been with them for years and they have a great practice and have never made me second guess anything that they have done. I actually need to go back.
-1	I dont trust any dr because they just want to push drugs and treat symptons rather than practice preventative sickness or injury
1	I trust my primary care physician because I think they are very thorough. I feel like they go through all the necessary questions to diagnose me and prescribe the right medications to help me feel better.
-1	I do not feel that I have known my primary care person long enough to say whether I trust or distrust her. I would need more time to make a determination.
1	she makes sure I take care of my self by making sure I see my specialist andd double checking what they say
-1	I take what any doctor says with a grain of salt.  I do not see them as gods or absolute authorities.  I do respect their knowledge, however I blend it with my own knowledge as well.  I'm the only one who has lived in my body all my life, therefore I am the authority of my body.
-1	Very few doctor visits are completely satisfactory, maybe because my expectations are too high. I think that if you see the medical profession as just another job, you tend to just try to go through and get over with any patient care at hand as quickly as you can. 
1	I trust my dry. Because I have had to have treatments of plasma 3 times a week for 4 weeks and 4 treatments of MeMO have been made better by listening to him and the treatments he suggested.
-1	I do not go to my family doctor often but if I had a health condition that I needed to see him more frequently, my answer might change. Sometimes I feel like doctors are in a hurry to see their next patient that they do not see completely to my needs (which there are very few).
-1	I trust my doctors because they know what there doing they've went to school for years to learn and master what they do so I just have this feeling everything is alright
-1	I have never had a bad experience with a doctor. I always ask questions and have an open dialog. It works for me.
-1	My doctor is relatively young, but I feel like he has grown over the 5 or so years I've seen him. Professional growth is a good sign that he is at least trying. I don't trust him completely because I live in an area that the best professionals tend to avoid. I assume he is a bit of a reject. Also, how can you trust any doctor when most of them spend all of 6 minutes diagnosing you?
-1	Cause sometime they can be wrong about  some stuff about you if yoy go to anthor place it different resulr
-1	The doctor that i have now listens to my problems and does not just push off what i'm having problems with as it's because of what you eat.
-1	Doctor's are too tied to pharmaceutical companies so that has to be taken into account and I prefer to avoid meds whenever possible.
1	I trust my primary care physician physician because she is very thorough and she takes the time to discuss her findings with me.  She makes me aware of my medical conditions and always ask me if I have questions.
1	In general I trust my primary care physician. I haven't had a reason ever to distrust him. He has always been helpful and courteous, I think the care is of good quality.
-1	I believe doctors in general do have the patients' interest at hurt and thus is why I trust my primary care physician.
1	cause I like to know whats going on with my health they should always be trueful when they talking to you dealing with your health
-1	My doctor is very trusting. She is transparent and completely open. I am able to ask her anything and she will give me the truth whether it's good or bad. I feel confident when I see her for treatment. 
-1	I trust my PCP because she seems intelligent and seems to care about her patients. But I don't completely trust her since she is human and is very busy. She doesn't have time to be extremely thorough and careful.
-1	I trust my doctor because they know what is best for me to be in good health. They are kind and treat me with respect. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because this person has had many, many years of school, and dedicated their life to making sure they explore, examine and treat those that are in their care for different illnesses. I have little medical knowledge so I always listen to my physician. However, that doesn't mean I listen blindly. I always do my own research and get a second opinion.  
1	I trust my doctor because she has always been honest with me. She has shown concern when I don't take my medication correctly.. She gives me options and her honest opinion due to my habits
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has yet to give me a reason not to. Before I was diagnosed with a life threatening illness, she kept me updated on what her findings were before recommending me to a specialist. Additionally, she makes me feel welcome and less nervous when entering her office. She'll make sure that not only my physical health is in shape, but also my mental health because I have a history of depression. She is a really good doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor as much as possible while realizing she is human and makes mistakes. My doctor asks open-ended questions and allows me to express my concerns openly.  She talks to me about different options I have regarding treatment.  I never feel like she is rushed or in a hurry to get to her next patient. 
-1	I would have to say that I somewhat trust my primary care physician. Its not that he isn't a nice guy its just that he doesn't really listen to what I might want or need. Its always him thinking he knows best because he is the doctor, but in all actuality I know my body better then he does. Sometimes I feel like he isn't telling me everything I need to know because he might not like what I have to say.
-1	Because you asked about my GP, I usually see him when it's about something specific. Generally he listens, performs a few simple, superficial tests and then refers me to a specialist.
-1	My doctor usually rushes through, spends bare minimal time with me.  He makes me feel like I don't know my own body. He usually tries to push his opinions on me. 
1	I trust my doctor she saved my life when I awful sick, she choose an old fashion treatment for my sickness.
-1	My doctor is generally in a rush.  I only see him once a year for a check up so I guess that's good but then I have a year's worth of questions to ask.  I usually get one in and then he's off to the next patient.  He was effective at treating a friend of mine so I guess I should trust him on that basis but there's just not enough time.  
1	Am very confident in the care and treatment I receive from my primary care physician  because she is very good and honest and everything that she has inform me with was just that. 
1	I trust my doctor because he is always upfront and honest. He takes the time to actually listen to my concerns and takes into consideration my opinions about my health. He works with me to get the kind of medicines that I also will approve of taking instead of giving me medicines that I believe are more dangerous for me to take. He seems very trustworthy and honest. 
-1	Just his general presence and how he is willing to explain everything in detail and will allow extra time in appointments to go over any concerns I may have.
1	After a visit I check everything he has told me.
1	they have taken care of me for years and they know what they are doing when they give me advice or prescriptions
-1	They really don't take the time to talk with me nor make me feel like my needs and concerns are being heard.
-1	Sometimes she doesn't always get things right, but most of the time she does.I trust in her ability to find the best solution. 
1	She goes out of her way to make sure I feel comfortable and to see if anything else is wrong. She tells me things about herself if she has similar problems to make me feel better about my issues. 
1	She has always been very thorough in her explations and care. She has also always made my options very clear to me.
-1	I dont trust all doctors but my primary physician is a very nice man. He is very thorough and honest but always uplifting and looks on the bright side.
1	I trust my primary doctor to tell me what I need to know to take care of my health. I am confident she will give it to me straight. I trust what my doctor has to say.
1	Three generations of my family use my doctor as their primary care physician, and we all feel very comfortable with her. She has, on multiple occasions, found something of concern to her and sent us for testing which resulted in medical procedures needing to be performed. She prescribes medicine when we're sick, takes the time to fully explain what's going on, and responds quickly to emails/voicemails that we leave her.
-1	idk
-1	My new doctor is usually very good so I trust him well. However, I feel that doctors in general tend to push certain drugs  even when there are better options available. For instance I have asthma and my doctor pushed a certain inhaler that was more expensive than a cheaper, better option.
-1	I sort of trust my doctor. I go to the health department so I'm Getting cheap care . But I believe they are sincerely trying to help as much as possible 
1	She takes a great interest in listening to my concerns and questions. She tells me that I am in charge and that she is here to help me make the best decisions. She lets me know that she is determined to help me get well. 
1	I've been going to the same doctor for years. He is very kind and shows that he actually cares about my wellbeing. He is never in a hurry and explains everything to me in a way that I can understand.
-1	I distrust my doctor sometimes because I think she is more concerned with saving the VA hospital money by delaying my treatment . I trust her because at times she goes to bat for me sometimes .
1	I trust my PCP because she takes her time when evaluating my symptoms or concerns and doesn't try to rush through the evaluation as fast as she can.  She also reminds me of routine tests that I forget to schedule.
1	I don't know.  I am not going to put a whole lot of though into why I trust my doctor.  I suppose, if he had ever given me any reason not to trust him, he would not be my doctor any more.
-1	Because he/she can be right or wrong due to the fact that care physicians are humans they to can make mistakes
-1	I do not know.  I have not gone to a primary care physician in 17 years.
-1	I don't fully trust my doctors because they're fallible and because I don't know their jobs and therefore can't know if they're truly correct or not.  But that doesn't bother me tremendously because I feel like I'm the ultimate decider on medical decisions and I'm a full participant in getting medical care.  I use the doctor as a resource, but not the final authority.  They answer to me, so I scrutinize their decisions and judgments while still recognizing their knowledge and experience.
-1	It's easy to communicate with my doctor and he talks to me using words I would understand and if neededâ I would be able to to tell it to someone else
1	My primary care physician is a very nice young woman and I have been to her several times over the past years.  She has always told me what is necessary and I have never sensed any dishonesty in speaking with her.  She has told me the truth about everything I have asked about. She also listens to what I told her I thought was the problem.  She has agreed with me on many occasions. She has referred me to another physician when she thought it was beyond her scope.  I have asked for prescriptions that I felt would be necessary for me and she has complied and agreed with me.  She is young and I feel she has the most current knowledge possible.  I have never looked at her as inexperienced.  She has always presented herself very professiol and she presents herself as very knowledgeable.  In conversations with her, she IS actually knowledgeable. 
1	Dr. Dixon is comforting for the most part and I have been a patient of hers for a long time so that helps me trust her. But sometimes I get confused.
-1	Sometimes doctors aren't up on the latest research. I've had experiences where doctors let their prejudice against me affect the care I've received. Sometimes doctors don't understand how multiple conditions interact with each other. I think that while most of them are well-meaning and generally competent, they're also busy and stressed and sometimes get stuck in their habits. 
-1	"For the most part I do trust my Dr, but at times I feel like she is rushed. Last time I was there I had told her that I had hurt my back and my chiropractor did a MRI and I found out I had degenerative disc disease. I asked her if she had someone she would refer me to if I needed injections. She acted like it wasn't a big deal and said ""ya, we dot that all the time."" I guess I would have felt better if she had asked to obtain a copy of the MRI (or look to see if she had it, as I gave her name when it was done) and look at the extent of damage and give me some names. I also feel like she doesn't look at previous issues and see if I have had any symptoms relating to those. "
-1	I go to a nurse practitioner at a clinic.  I'm fairly happy with her but not completely.  I don't think they're that thorough and they've made a couple of mistakes in a fairly short time.  I'm considering changing to somewhere else.
1	I trust my primary care physicians because they are honest & upfront with me. They don't tell me what I want to hear.
-1	DOCTORS ARE LIKE GOD
-1	I am currently between doctors, but in general, I haven't experienced any issues where a doctor seemed to dismiss my concerns or rush me.
-1	I haven't been seeing him long enough to completey trust him.  I had a doctor before him who I thoroughly trusted but she left.
-1	Although my GP is most likely intends to do her correctly, with the high number of patients under her care I can't trust that she able to fulfill her responsibilities. With the private health care system dominating in a society where so many people are below the poverty line, it becomes impossible to see a GP more than once a year. If you develop any medical issue between the appointments the only option for so many Americans is to go to the emergency room.   
1	I trust my primary doctor because she tells what I need to do and what not to do. I have no distrust in my doctor at all. 
-1	I trust her because she has more knowledge than I do on medical situations. I have slight distrust because sometimes I feel she rushes with patients and just gives the easiest solution instead of taking each individuals health differences into consideration 
1	They usually Iistens attentively,  always asks if you have any input or suggestions. Does tests, x-rays and send to others doctors for things outside of their scope of expertise. 
-1	I've never really trusted doctors in my lifetime. They either are really disconnected or they're not good listeners. 
-1	for the most part he takes the time to listen to what I have to say and explain why he wants me to take a medication or have a test done. However he doesn't make any changes when I suggest that some medication can be stopped or reduced
-1	I don't trust the government which employs doctors. They put stuff in our medicine that makes us worst or sick and these doctors just follow. 
-1	My Dr has been in my life for years and is always there when I need her. She is kind and like a second mother figure I am depressed and I could go to her office without an appointment and she will pull me in her office and be a listening ear
1	I have no reason to believe that they do not care about their work and patients. There would be no reason for them to choose such a demanding career if they did not care. They also would have no reason to self sabotage their career. 
-1	I have been with my family doctor for many years. She takes the time to explain things to me that I don't understand and doesn't ever do any unnecessary testing on me. She and I have a good doctor/patient relationship. 
1	They have gone to school to learn what they are doing and I have been going to them for a while and learned to trust what they have to say.  I have a good comfort level with them, and if you can't trust your doctor, you should change them.
1	I trust my PCP because I have a long history with him. He asks appropriate questions to see how I am doing or feeling. I answer his questions honestly & never withhold any information that could affect my care or diagnosis.
-1	I think my primary care physician is really good at his job and I trust his recommendation most of the time.
-1	I had a 3 month cough, I was told it would get better on its own.
1	I trust my physician because she has been my doctor all my life and nothing has never went wrong with me while under her treatment.
1	Back home my family doctor took care of my parent and me very well. And he was very reliable and openly honest. If he was not sure he would get a second opinion.
1	My primary care physician has always behaved very professionally with me. He is open to answering my questions and will explain things to me when necessary. I know he has had years of schooling and he is very knowledgeable.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician, if I didn't I would switch my doctor, I have trust in all the medical providers I use and that includes my opthamalogist,  my gastroenterologist, my orthopedist, my dentist, my urologist and any other health care providers I need and my family needs.
-1	CONSECUENT PORTFOLIO SOLUTION OF ESTIMATING SIMPLE CONTRARY OF THE INSPIRED PROSPECT SECURITY INPUT ACCOUNT RIGHT
-1	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples. 
-1	he has a medicail degree so i trust him to take care of me when needed also when im haveing problem with others thi gs
-1	I don't have much trust in my former mainstream (allopathic) doctor mainly because of the way information in allopathic medicine is taught, from a top down and 'condition-osis' perspective.  There is no such thing in mainstream medicine as understanding a situation from the ground up.  Instead, a description of a condition is projected onto the patient and care is given based on that projection.  My doctor did absolutely nothing for me in regards to my scoliosis that got so bad my entire rib cage began to slip out of place.  Instead of seeing what was there, he acted on the preconceived notion of what scoliosis was and the problems it can cause.
1	In regard to doctors in general, I feel that most put people first and are there because they generally care about people. I don't believe any doctor will intentionally mislead a patient, because I don't think any of them want to face the repercussions from doing so. Ultimately, if they don't treat their patients right, they won't be practicing much longer.
-1	They are self serving like all humans, which means they can't be trusted. This is true for any given example involving humans and trust. However, individuals can be trusted. The problem is there are too many doctors and not enough caring people. Doctors want to line their pockets in gold and caring people want to actually help. Unfortunately, there are little to no caring people left in this world. Doctors sign up knowing the work will he hard, then when they actually see it is difficult, they just give up and turn into worthless meat sacks like everyone else. They commit themselves to a life a servitude then do nothing of the sort. They are profoundly hypocritical in most aspects, and far too lazy to truth know how to, or be able, to help. Doctors are worthless in our society. Until I actually see one personally that is willing to deal with the rabble and listen to my personal, legitimate problems as just that, I will never trust, nor respect those morons. 
1	My doctor haven't given me a reason to distrust me. He tell me his personal struggles and I tell him mines, but he might do things for himself also. I wouldn't doubt that or blame him, but he haven't given me reason not to trust him
1	I feel comfortable with her.  I believe she has the same philosophy as me as to healing holistically vs. medically. 
-1	He is local and easy to get a appointment and he takes time to listen to me and knows my history and plans my treatment according ly
-1	i have know my doctor for many years, trust all his recommendations and scripts.i have referred friends and family to see  also.
1	I think doctors tend to want what is best for their patients. If I ask enough questions and understand things correctly then I can get a sense of the diagnosis. 
-1	i trust the doctor with some of my health issues and i can trust them with most decisions and i take all things into consideration 
1	I trust him because he has open communication and when I ask questions I get honest responses as well as way to be even more health and get better
1	I trust my PCP because he is thoughtful and caring. He always asks about my health and if I have questions. He remembers my name and information we have discussed during prior appointments. He is thorough with examinations. He takes his time.
1	I have been lucky to have always had doctors that I have complete trust in. They have always been thorough in evaluating my symptoms or issues and have taken the time to sit down and have a conversation about my options. They have always been open to questions and I have never feel rushed or felt they were putting their convenience over my well-being.
-1	i have a new dr so i trust her in a general way, don;t really know her. i do trust most dr.s Have had some good ones.
-1	Most of the time, I feel my doctor is under qualified or is just there to make a buck.  Sometimes I have ongoing medical issues that I mention to my doctor,  and the issues get overlooked or played down as if nothing is wrong. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have not found anything to distrust them about. I understand what he tells me and it always seems to fit with what diagnosis he has for me. I make sure to look up things and learn about them and nothing has ever raised my suspicions that my doctor is wrong or way of base.
1	I have been seeing her for many years and she has never given me reason not to trust her. She is kind and I really look forward to seeing and speaking with her. I feel that she cares about me persolly, and I am not just a number. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she seems like she cares about my well being and wants to help.
1	I have been going to my PCP for over 10 years.  She is always happy to see me, and takes all the time that I need.  Every decision she makes has been the right one.  She has so much experience and makes me feel well cared for. 
-1	He has proven himself trustworthy and very intelligent. As a Christian he offers his services in ministry and offers a lot fee when patients don't have insurance.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time out to thoroughly listen to what's going on with me. If she can not find an answer at first  she travels many roads to do so.
-1	When I had serious medical complications, my doctor sent me to a specialist rather than trying to deal with the situation himself. I feel confident that he actually cares about my well-being.
-1	I mainly trust the doctors that I see or my children but I definatly make sure that we agree upon a treatment
-1	the doctor i last saw is no longer working in the doctor's office I go to so I don't know how I would answer this question.
1	Basically if I or my family have complaint about our health we will go to our family doctor. We trust our family doctor, if he ask us to see specialist we will do.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician.  I think doctors in general, such as the doctors I've gone to in the past, want to get you out of there as quickly as possible so they want to avoid finding out anything more about a situation or saying anything specific to the individual and not generic.  I generally don't think doctors have taken me seriously.
1	My pPCPis a good person and I trust her.  She is interested in me personally, I can tell, and takes her time when I am with her.  My gut feeling is always good about her.  I'm glad I found her as my PCP.
1	I like and trust my primary physician. He takes his time with me and answers all my questions. I believe he's well-informed.
-1	My primary care physician is very kind and listens to my problems, so I have high confidence and trust in him.
1	I trust that my physician wants what is best for me, but I think they are also bound to what their organization they work for want and what insurance companies will allow. The organizations and insurance companies are only interested in making money and do not have my best interests in mind and put pressure on Drs to avoid expensive procedures - that can delay needed treatment.
-1	Most of the time I do trust them.  I do think sometimes they are running on autopilot.
1	My primary care physician always shows up clean and prepared to attend to me. the look kind and take time to explain stuff to me so I know theyre trustworthy .
1	She has always provided me with the best answers to my situations. She also is a very good listener and provides for my needs.
-1	I feel that my provider has my best interest in my physical well being and takes the time to answer any questions I may have.
1	i have had him for 11 years and never once has he not taken my questions or worries with seriousness.
1	My doctor thoroughly explains procedures and options I may have, helping me make the best choice.  She patiently answers all my questions.  She consults with specialists I see to be sure that her treatment will not interfere with theirs.
1	I have only had two primary care physicians in my 30 years of life. I am very particular and will only stick with a physician I feel I can completely trust. My current doctor is very open minded and has never once shut down any of my concerns. He has never made me feel rushed in an exam room. He gives his patients his cell and home phone numbers in case we need anything. He is always there and available. He is extremely supportive of my choices and the way I want my healthcare to go, but isn't afraid to tell me I'm making the wrong choices and offer better ideas when needed.
-1	The nurse practitioners have started to slowly replace primary physicians. I have had negative experiences being touched inappropriately by a physicians. I distrust their motives.
1	I trust my physician because she is educated and well recommended. She is knowledgeable and seems to care.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he hasn't led me down the wrong path yet. He tells me everything that I need to know about any disease or illness.
-1	My primary care physician only seems to know the basics.  He has diagnosed a few things others missed.
1	a doctor is experienced at problem solving and can help my medical need. doctors' have years of practice in the medical field and years of learned skills in a medical class room. he isn't dumb
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been in practice for a long time.  He is extremely experienced.
-1	I have new doctors this year are so far so good.  I haven't had any interaction other than normal routine appointments
1	m\My primary care doctor has been seeing my family for many years. he always makes time to call and check in if one of us is very ill and makes us feel like he is doing his best to put our health first 
1	My physician always takes the time out to answer my questions and explain things. She is very honest and blunt.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always treated me like a valued individual and explained things to me thoroughly. She is persoble and friendly but also knowledgeable and a fast talker. I really love my doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor's motives; I don't think his knowledge is always complete.  I live in a relatively small town and use a primary-care physician simply to order things like routine cholesterol screenings, and perhaps as a first source of information about things I can't figure out myself. If I had a significant medical problem, I would try to drive somewhere else and see a specialist.
1	I think that when it comes to healthcare you should trust but verify. I think that there is a common way to deal with problems, but it is not always what is best for your undiviual needs. I like to learn what my doctor recommends but also look for other options and tural treatments as well. I think my doctor is awesome, but she is just human, and therefore it is important to have other ways of obtaining other opionons. 
-1	He took me off a dangerous medication without out weening me off without caring about side effects of quitting cold turkey I.lost weight I can't sleep my anxiety spiked up I'm.jittery
1	because they work at one of the top hospitals in the country and they know their job. plus they took an oath, which should stand for something.
1	My doctor is always very open with their thoughts on any condition I come to them about.  They always give me a chance to ask questions and always make sure that I have a chance to say everything I feel is important.
-1	I've known my doctor since I was little I trust him completely in every discussion we have and every decision he makes I even trust the nurses 
1	My doctor will always lay out several options if I have a problem and she will go over all of them with me and tell me the pluses and minuses to each one and then she will help me to make the best choice for what I need and if she disagrees with something I have chosen she will tell me why and then say what she thinks would be a better choice
-1	My doctor has always been very open and honest with me and she has not had an issue telling me how she feels in regards to my own health and well being.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes her time when she is seeing me, she is knowledgeable, smart, kind, caring, wants to help me whenever I am sick or need to discuss something with her. She always has my best interest and in mind when she is tending to my health needs.
-1	BSECAUSE HE ARE SHE WHEN TO SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO HELP PEOPLE. I WOULD NOT GO TO THE DOCTOR IF I DID NOT TRUST THEM
1	I like my doctor and I can relate to him. He's a very funny guy, uses humor to relax his patients and to communicate.  It works!  He gets to the heart of the matter quickly.
-1	Sometimes it seems like he is pushing pharmaceutical trials on me. He does not always seem genuinely interested in my welfare, although we make small talk often.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have known her for a long time and she always have time to see me and my family in case of any emergency. She is always honest and straight forward about my medical issues.
1	She's a doctor who's a female that has bee in the business for quite a while.  Plus my husband knows her.
1	Me and my doctor may disagree from time to time, but I never doubt that he has my best interest in mend when discussing my health with me.
1	Have had the same doctor for 20+ years. Always has been on the ball. Good with reminders and any updates.
-1	My doctor sends me for ultrasounds that I don't need. 
1	They're busy and tired, but they have guidelines and responsibilities to give me the best care for me. They didn't waste all that time in school and during their career to give me poor treatment. I trust them.
-1	He's done well with me.. But as I watch my mom begin Alzheimer's my belief in our doctor is dying. He did a test but she passed. It was picking up a piece of paper off the floor.. hmmmmm I know it might be hard to detect... but Doctors should know more about this problem.  
1	Unfortunately, time and time again, we have seen lots of dishonest practices from physicians. This is why I cannot trust the a 100 percent.
1	I come from a small community and there have been several times that myself or a family member has been in for one thing or another and it would not be uncommon for our Dr. to call the home phone or cell on his time off to see how we were doing and if something was not right he would meet you at hospital or even your home, all on his own time.
-1	"In general, when dealing with a physician, I find that they are blatantly unconcerned with the welfare of their patients up to the point at which they have concerns about legal liability. The vast majority of physician are running assembly line medical practices and are far more concerned about how many patients a day they can move through their office in much the same way that servers in high-volume restaurants are concerned about how many tables they can move during their shift: It is the attempt to /appear/ to care rather than actual concern for the person who is being cared for. That said, I have been fortute enough to have experiences with truly professiol doctors who I often describe as being scientists rather than simply being a part of the medical industry, ""machine,"" so to speak. The pediatrician for my children is a remarkable man who is often willing to spend thirty minutes with each of my children making sure that they have no troubles and beyond that even longer discussing any concerns I have about my children's health. When one of my children needed a fairly minor surgery I was just overwhelmed by the doctor he recommended for it. He was intelligent, concerned, professiol, and not rushed. He was clearly very busy, but he was willing and able to discuss all of my concerns. All things considered, the majority of doctors are not professiols. The professiols are few and far between and rarely encountered in a random selection of doctors."
-1	Because medical knowledge is still limited but doctors seem to think they have fil solutions, when in fact a lot of medicine is still trial and error. 
-1	Doctors in general are trustworthy.  They spend a lot of time in school and in practice.  They see lots of different things that happen to people and gain knowledge from those experiences which they can draw on to diagnose ailments.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for many years and has always done the correct thing pertaining to any sickness I've had. He has never treated me wrong or diagnosed me with the wrong illness. 
1	I trust my doctor or doctor's in general because otherwise why would I even go to them in the first place and if I am unsure of my doctor's ethic ability I would question everything about them.  That just doesn't sound like a good idea for my own health and I would be way more stressed out.  I trust my doctor because to me it's the best option.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor, but I know that she doesn't know how to deal with my real life problems.  She keeps telling me to go to a counselor, but when that is not an option for your patient, you have to have other options available to them.  She has not been able to help me beyond the basic physical ailments I have.  She is not any help emotionally or able to advise me where I can get the kind of help she thinks I need.  It's a weird situation. 
-1	My trust is based upon how well she listens and the feedback she gives. I believe the good health means less drugs and more healthy eating, exercise and spiritual peace. She believes that also.
1	I strongly trust my doctor because my doctor has yet to tell me something wrong and is honest about everything.
-1	I trust my primary care due to the years of experience, references and relationship that is trusted and have been known to deliver sound results and recommendations
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is the one who went to medical school and I am not, and because I am in good health after seeing her for medical problems. All my problems have always been resolved by going to the doctor so I have no reason not to trust her.
1	My physician is also a family friend. He has proven his trustworthiness by taking extra time when I have a visit to the office. He answers all my questions and concerns.
-1	When it boils down, a doctor is still a human and all humans are prone to error.  I believe they are obviously more educated on health subject matter than me, but I don't necessarily put 100% trust that they know best all of the time. 
-1	I trust my phyiscan because her throughly checks me out and ask many questions about how my health is going.
1	I have known him for quite awhile.  he is well respected and has an excellent reputation.  He always takes time to talk with me and address any concerns that i might have. 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part. I feel that he will do right by me but sometimes I feel I am being rushed. I can not think of anything else to say.
-1	ALL DOCTORS WANT IS MONEY
1	My doctor seems to really want me to understand what problem I have and how to correct/ prevent it.
1	"My doc. is a very caring and compassionate person, he gives my all the time I need to discuss questions and concerns I may have, he has great ""bedside manners"". He always takes an interest in me and my health."
-1	The only reason I go to my doctor for a yearly wellness check up is because I have to in order to have my prescription birth control refilled. I don't particularly like my doctor and sometimes I feel like she doesn't know what she's talking about.
-1	Most doctors get paid commission on certain products. This is conflict of interest. I don't trust that
-1	I see more specialists than I see my primary. The specialists are very conservative in treatment planning and sometimes I have to present my own research to get treatment moving along
1	I trust my doctor because she seems genuinely interested in my concerns when I ask questions. When there is something I need to do, she gives me options that are based in real, conventional medicine and doesn't try to brush me off by suggesting placebo-like alternative treatments. She seems cautious and checks my lab results, and will take some time to see if my concern is based on an injury or illness during an exam. If something seems like it will clear up on its own, like some pains, she will suggest contacting her office if it doesn't get better in a certain number of days or weeks. I like her style of care and her advice is almost always a good way forward.
-1	I basically trust doctors to do the right thing...but I make sure to research or learn more about a treatment or medicine if it is prescribed for me before I do anything blindly
1	I have had the same primary care physician for seven years.  We have mutual respect and trust in each other.  My primary care physician is very credible, highly credentialed, and always professional.
-1	I currently don't have a PCP and haven't even gone to a doctor in over 3 years. I do have problems with depression and anxiety and was being seen at a mental health clinic up until about 6 months ago when they refused to re-new my medications because I was unable to pay the copays that I owed them.
1	My doctor is very forthright and honest, they give me the information that I need to know and will give me ideas on what I can honestly do to help make myself healthier or achieve my goals.
1	I do not go very often to a doctor, but I have the same family doctor since I was quite young, and I believe he has always done a good job helping me to maintain good health, and warning me of risks and dangers posed by my behaviors.
1	First you have to find an excellent doctor - and there are many. Then put your faith in him or her. i have no primary care physician but the specialists i have seen for any problems i have had have been excellent.
-1	I have always had good and wonderful doctors with very good to excellent care..I haven't had any bad experiences with my doctors or bad care
1	I trust my doctor completely. He tells me things that I do not want to hear because I already know what he is going to tell 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to listen, solicits input, and carefully explains everything to me.
1	he is always honest about he's work and he cares for he's patients he always comes to work 100 percent ready to get the day started
-1	My doctor is not as thorough as I would like him to be. I mean he seems to care when you talk to him but he's a pill doctor. When I first got diagnosed with hyperthyroidism he seemed not to even know what that was! He's concerning but not thorough
-1	Yghbxc Riddick 65 days 48 2c bc gvbc duo uncle to silk go x Stu sick dBm and I'm not sure what to say to you in a while back 3wl I just got home and pub crawl 
1	I have been a patient of this doctor for many years and we work together on solving my medical issues. I completely trust her judgement on what the plan of action should be.
-1	I have a great general physician, but I typically like to research my conditions and then review options with my doctor before making a decision. If I disagree, I seek a second opinion. 
-1	because they just  care about how much money they can get from I have had to make the decision for like chorlesterol meds
-1	They always are straight forward if they don't understand or not sure they will require more testing to find out what is going on and what we can do next to help or fix the issue that is going on at that time
-1	I have never known him to lie about anything but sometimes I don't think another drug is the answer for everything, I like natural approaches to as many things as possible.
1	I trust my doctor because he's an excellent healthcare provider. He has always been honest, open and trustworthy. He also has a good bedside manner. My doctor listens to my needs and complaints and addresses them accordingly.
-1	i often have to seek a second opinion because i don't think my doctor really understands my problem. she is good for easy things, like a flu shot or antibiotics prescription, but i would not trust her to correctly diagnose and treat a more complicated issue.  
-1	I trust my doctor to an extend, but I think it's always important to do research on conditions for yourself and God third party medical opinions as well.
-1	I trust my doctor because it seems he always has my best interests in mind. He doesn't lie to me as far as I know. He also doesn't just push medication on me, he tries to understand what I actually need.
1	I basically trust doctors because they have more knowledge than I do. I do not completely trust anyone.  If my doctor says or suggests something I do not agree on I will question her. If I ever feel I can't trust my doctor I will find a new doctor
-1	I trust my doctor as he has good reputation with patients,and i have found him to be quite honest,and straightforward in my treatments.
-1	I think that the majority of doctors enter the field because they have some desire to help others. I trust my doctor, who has undergone years of schooling and is an expert, to guide me on the correct path to health. 
-1	He is relaxed, personable and most importantly, approachable.  These attributes make him trustworthy and reliable.
-1	I have completely trusted my physicians in the past.  We just moved so I am still trying to find a physician I can truly trust.
1	I haven't yet run into a doctor that wasn't looking out for my benefit or gave me bad advice. I've heard stories of bad doctors out there who look out for their benefit first, but I've thankfully never ran into one of those doctors myself. Heck, I had surgery a few years back that saved one of my testicles from dying. I think I had something called testicular torsion. Doctor saw what the problem was and gave me the right advice to getting it fixed.
-1	The primary care physicians are going to spend as little time with patients as possible.  They are busy and dont have time to explain everything or care about every patient.  If the doctor prescribes me a drug or suggests a certain treatment I will do thorough research on my own time and make my own decision about my course of treatment.
1	I trust my primary care physician as I have gone to him for many years and he has always been honest and upfront about any problems or procedures that needed to be done.
-1	My doctor is a seasoned professiol. He has really good persol qualities. That makes me feel will do no harm when it comes to his medical advice.
-1	I have visited a lot of Primary Care Physicians and finally have one I trust. He is extremely knowledgeable and great at answering any question no matter how small. She gives me multiple treatment and medication options and lets me decide what path I would like to take.
1	She's has put a lot thought and selflessness into her work doesn't give up easily keeps track of different levels kindly sees to the weight loss
-1	I believe that the process for becoming a doctor is a long and arduous one.  This makes it a profession in which a larger percentage of the individuals in it are truly committed to their practice.  Being a doctor is an extremely important job and I think the majority of doctors in it truly want what is best for the patient.
1	I trust my primary physin because h tells me the whole truth without any questions,I have my complete confidence I him
1	I find that my pcp takes her time when examining and listens to what I am saying. She is stern about certain things but does not push unnecessary treatments or procedures. 
1	I trust my doctor will always do whats in my best interests.  They have the expertise that I lack.  I trust that they have seen similar cases and can react accordingly.
1	I'm lucky that I have not had to go to see my doctor often. I see a nurse practitioner and feel that see is totally competent and I trust her to give me the right diagnosis.   
-1	I don't really like going to the doctor at all.  I'm not sure that I personally like my pcp at the moment
1	I trust my doctor,because she is looking out for my best intersting i her hand.She let me know what is right,and what is wrong.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for 15 years. He sends me to specialist when my care is outside of his realm of primary care and so far he has sent me to doctors that have been pretty good with my specialties. There was a time that I did not have insurance and my doctor did his best to do what he could that would help without insurance.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is caring and concern about my health throughout the years. He also does an exceptional job taking care of his patients and very loyal to them.
-1	Every single person in my family has trusted their doctor and ended up worse off for it. That is, except for surgeons. I never really have a need to go to a doctor, but I've been to a few dentists, one of which was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Filling fell out within days and their work was extremely sub-par. I had to go to a different dentist to get it fixed which cost me quite a bit. I've been with my significant other when she has went to her doctor and they literally googled symptoms. Yeah, I don't have a lot of faith in GP's. 
-1	Some Doctor you can Trust and it some u can not Trust they will tell u one thing and it might be some else
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician, but I do trust my specialist.  My PCP seems to be in a hurry and the practice is inflexible, and pushing tests/vaccinations I'm not interested in.  
-1	I had my fourth sinus surgery in December of 2016, It left me with permanent nerve damage, and the doctor does not think he is at fault. I have been to multiple specialists and no one can find a way to alleviate the constant pain.
1	The doctor always explains the medical problem in detail, and doesn't assume you know what he is talking about.  He thoroughly answers all my questions about the problem or the options.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they are very professional, experienced, and knowledgeable. They have never done anything detrimental to my health.  
1	As I mentioned earlier, I've had the same doctor for a long time. I almost consider him a friend at this point. He may be one way with other people but with me I knowhe's completely honest and cares about my health over his wallet or time.
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. He has been my doctor for at least 20 years. He is caring and compassionate. believe he truly cares about me as a patient and friend. He convinced me that I have a long life to live if I take care of myself. I lost over 100 pounds with his encouragement. I believe that I can tell him anything.
-1	not forthcoming with info and seem to rush through appointments.  Also, don't seem interested in the causes of medical conditions or events.  Not interested in probing further
-1	I just acquired a new PCP and he seems to be very thourough but by the book with no deviations. He doesn't have any faith in holistic or healthfood supplements
1	I have been going to the same doctor for a good number of years.  He is always willing to sit and discuss with me and explain to be anything I am unsure of.
-1	All the times I have visited a doctor or had an exam or even surgery I was always treated with respect, I asked many questions, sometimes the same questions multiple times and I always got the same answer and was not steered wrong. Rarely have I had a disagreement with a doctor .
1	Because they work in the most trusted and award winning hospital in the country. And plus they took an oath.
-1	i trust my primary physician in some things but when dealing with the medication i take i dont trust it at all it could be right medication it could not be
1	I do not have a primary care physician and avoid seeing doctors when at all possible. However, I do see a clinical psychologist at least weekly, and I trust her completely. She has been working with me for several years now, has been very helpful, and always seems to have her patients' interest first. She goes out of her way to be kind and respect who I am as a person. As for doctors in general, my experiences have been very mixed - some very caring and helpful, others very cold, disrespectful, and arrogant. With that being the case, when I do have to resort to seeing a doctor, I try to keep an open mind, but I also find that I try to gather as much pertinent information as possible before I go to an appointment, communicate the problem clearly (and ONLY the current problem, no extraneous information), and let them know what has worked for me in the past if I've had this issue before. I find it difficult to trust doctors who seem to have their own agenda - for instance, ones who insist on prescribing medications that I know are not really effective for me, or ones who treat every patient as though they're a drug addict (and there are a LOT of these doctors in our area).
-1	the doctor profession is a divine profession, I have great respect towards them, they know our body situation better so I trust the doctors verymuch
-1	Honestly i trust them to do what is expected from a doctor nothing more or less I feel they are professionals that are trained for this and i must put trust in them to give me they're best treatment based on the training they have 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have had the same doctor for years and we have a good reltionship and I don't know what else to say about this
1	I trust doctors to know what's best for patients because they have the required knowledge and training to diagnose these problems and provide accurate information to help solve issues.
-1	I have been having a growing feeling that my doctor is not doing all he can to help me lower my blood pressure. The medication I am using now, the fourth, is not working very well at all.
-1	I believe they do a good job, are a decent person and a good doctor. However I would still never put my trust completely fully in them, not without them earning my full trust in some way.
-1	I trust my physician to be analyzing any potential issues and recommending appropriate and safe treatments for me in order to recover.
1	My doctor has always been very upfront and honest with me about my physical condition and what treatments I need to take even if they might not be what I want.  He always asks about my well being as about my family and will even recommend me to seek other consolation if it is beyond his expertise. I consider him a friend as well as a doctor.
-1	I trust her medical opinions and try to ask questions when I need to.  I have been seeing her for years, so she knows my history well. 
-1	I normally have a good relationship with my doctors. Although we have disagreed on some topics, they have mostly been correct in those cases.
1	I've known my doctor for 25 years and I see us more as friends than a doctor-patient relationship.
-1	My previous doctor let this practice and the partner is now my doctor.  As far as I know he is dependable but I haven't actually seen him for anything.  I see a nurse practitioner when I go there and she is very nice and helpful.  The office is nice and professional so I am assuming the doctor is similar to the other characteristics of the office.
1	I believe that my Dr knows em over the years and we have developed a relationship which is trustworthy and honest. We share info when needed without any concerns how the info is received. 
-1	I trust that he knows what he is doing and that he wants whats best for me and my health. Ive also have never had a problem with my doctor.
-1	I have faith in my doctor and trust her very much. Sometimes I feel that she is a little rushed but all in all she is honest with me and talks with me making me feel at ease.
1	I have a doctor that actually cares about people. The entire practice cares about doing what's best for the patient and not what's going to be the most profitable or the easiest option.
1	Well let's see. So far my Doctor hasn't led me astray yet. He has told me to lose some weight, but I think he knows that isn't going to happen anytime soon. When we have a problem, he is willing to work on it to figure out what is going on.
1	I can't say that I fully trust my doctors. After all, they are getting paid for what they do. I do believe if it came down to the cost of treatments they would choose they one with the highest cost for me.
-1	mostly trust but no one is perfect and dont hold them to 100.  If they do get something wrong or if they cant do what I expect then I can flex to what they are thinking or doing at the time
-1	They do their best for the most pRt but tend to follow the medical script, though are mostly well-intentioned and kind.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician at this time , but my husband and i are in the process of finding one and also going to have physicals done .
1	I trust my doctor because I have been a patient for over 30 years. I respect my doctor in providing good care towards me.
-1	"The doctor's clinic I go to often wants to run a bunch of tests which I think are often unnecessary. And because my insurance isn't that great, I end up paying thousands of dollars. Last year I had to pay $600 for a lyme disease test that my dr. thought I should get because I garden a lot. Every single time I go, a $40.00 charge for 'smoking counseling' shows up on my bill. But it is literally a five second conversation of ""You smoke?"" and me saying yes and the doctor saying ""you should quite"". No joke, nothing more than that 5 second sentence and they charge 40.00. I think it is a huge scam. "
-1	I had a procedure done approximately 1 year ago. It could have been done in office with just a numbing shot. Oh no, the doctor wanted me in the OR with a local . I finally talked her into a spinal  just to shut her up. I am still angry and upset over the bill and the doctor not listening to me
-1	I've been with my PCP since I was a teenager and she is my mother's doctor. Sometimes I feel like not all the right questions are asked by the PA, but the actual doctor in the office is usually pretty thorough
-1	I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN TO DIAGNOSE ME PROPERLY AND TO GIVE ME APPROPRIATE ATTENTION.  IF I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE I WOULD CHANGE DOCTORS.  BUT SO FAR I HAVE NOT HAD A NEED TOL.  
-1	I trust most doctors. No reasons to not trust doctors. I don't know how else to explain it Nothing else to write 
-1	I have been seeing my dr for a long time and she knows me pretty well.
1	I don't have any reason not to. My parents and a couple of my friends go to the same practice and I know they all like it there as well. 
-1	yes i trust primary care physician as they provide good services in hospital so that in future i dont get any trouble
-1	Doctors are busy and use mental shortcuts.  There is a large body of literature showing this.  Doctors are also generally very busy and shocking self-important, with little experience in the humility that actual scientists have.
-1	have had diagnosis and ended up going to a specialist to be treated correctly. makes me not trust my doctor for anything serious. 
-1	Who Sunil Endo shul think to do you  think homophobic to do check bunko stay stuff tho do dunno dunno syrup yup dunno affecting full full full full
-1	For the most I trust my physician. I do think that doctors need to spend more time with there patients. 
1	I trust my doctor because they are suppose to have the knowledge and tge know how to diagnose me correctly
-1	I trust to a point. Aslso as stated he may opt for expedience and convenience whcih may compromise the outcome and care.   its a mix
-1	i trust my primary care physician because they answer any questions i have and we talk over anything 
1	My primary is part of a medical group that is responsive and communicative. I find throughout my health needs they explain all tests, procedures and issues. If I have questions I can call any time. Plus they have an excellent online presence for appointments, access to records, payments etc. 
-1	the personal treatment they give me gives me a sense of how the physician cares about my health. As though they are more knowledgeable about me than i am. I'm a little distrustful of residents who have not had a lot of experience  because i get the feeling they're just guessing or they're not to confidant of there diagnosis  
1	My doctor is very experienced.  I can tell much about my doctor by his mannerisms.
-1	I trust my doctor, because she is the only one I have seen to diagnose me correctly and treat me accordingly. She has improved my day-to-day life, while the others have only done what they find convenient. 
-1	I think they are too much influenced by money, corruption and big pharma. 
-1	MY DOCTOR SEEMS TO BE PRO-ACTIVE ABOUT CONTACTING ME ABOUT ANY CONCERNS HE MAY HAVE WITH MY HEALTH OR ANY QUESTIONS THAT I MAY HAVE WITH ANY CONCERNS I HAVE.
1	I have had my oncologist for the last 5-6 years and I trust his opinion and I trust his treatment for me I have cancer my life is in his hands so I trust them
1	I only see my gynecologist regularly and I trust his opinion on conditions I am dealing with. He explains it to me clearly so I can understand what is going on and he makes me feel comfortable. He gets to know me as a person aside from just a patient and makes me feel like he cares about my overall well being. 
-1	Unfortunately, I live in a town where the doctors don't care about anything but money. I have been misdiagnosed (about having a heart attack)  that could have killed me. I have a hard time trusting doctors after that.
-1	I could create sentences. No need to. And since I'm gonna be forced to I'm going to probably get an attitude with this question. Pointless things like long waits and attitudes when patients ask for simple things ,- food, water, soda, etc. Those are the things people consume at home and could possibly help in the decision making process of healing. 
-1	He does take the time to pay attention to me and answer my questions.  He is about ready to retire and I am saddened about that.  These EHR mandates are a source of trouble for him
1	i have faith in my dr.i've been seeing her for a long time & believe she has done a good job at keeping me well and healthy. she is up on all of the latest medical problems and treatments. i feel safe in her hands
1	She is honest and is down to earth. She has my well being has her first priority and she is very thorough
-1	I've been going to the same health care provider for many years. I am very satisfied with my health care. I will most likely be there for the duration
1	Comfortable with my doctor and would do whatever he says that is needed, he is the one with the knowledge.
1	I trust a doctor to know more about what is wrong when it is an infection or severe injury. Mild injuries including soreness and stitches have had moderately incorrect diagnoses. 
-1	My most recent pcp never checked me or gave me tests I need to find out my problems. He would make it quick in and out visits.
1	I trust my Dr because he takes the time to explain things to me and answer any questions I may have.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP, but I do feel like she's a little old.  I think it's worth getting a second opinion when anything serious comes up. However, for general run of the mill problems, I think she's fine. 
1	I have a new Dr. He has been very thorough to let me know that I have his time and will be upfront and honest when it comes to my medical needs. 
1	He asks me questions about myself and my family with genuine interests. He asks me my opinion and explains things to me without me asking. His team seems knowledgeable and coordinated. I feel like more than a number or source of income.
1	Because he was my student in high school; I know him well; we have a strong bond and I know that he would not tell me to do anything that he wouldn't tell his own parents.
1	I've known my family doctor for a very long time and trust him on a persol level in addition to a professiol one.
1	I trust my doctor because he listens and is open to what I have to say or suggest. He also is very good at explaining things and various options available for whatever I may need. (for example: medication options) 
1	My doctor is human like, not robot like. They show they care. They show that they aren't perfect but they try to do what is best for me.
-1	Sometimes I think she doesn't listen to all my concerns or tries to easily explain away or dismiss my concerns.  I would like for her to try to resolve each issue and not blow me off.
-1	I do not fully trust my primary care physician because they have such a busy and hectic job.  How could they possibly always be able to perform well under their stressful work conditions?  They see patients for such a short time and it's hard to think they could always be right about what condition a person has, and what drug will make them better.
-1	I trsut my primary care doctor for the most part. However, i do feel as though they rush me out and dont take as much time as necessary.
1	My doctor has taken care of me for years. We have a good relationship. I am able to talk to him about my health and life in general. 
-1	Faith based, honest, she is very thourough when I come in to see her seems concerning. The nurses aid is very helpful as well. If u don't have trust in your doctor then you need to change
-1	i dont trust doctor at all. i do not beelieve a word they say. they are all the time lying making huge errors and other flakey stuff
1	I trust them for the most part. I feel that he doesn't have all the expertise I need for my different conditions though.
-1	I'm not sure I trust him because he's a psychiatrists I've been seeing for 5 years.  I'm going downhill and he doens't seem concerned.  he's told me to look on the internet for advice that he should be giving.
1	My doctor tell me everything.  They do not intentional leaves anything out.  I go to good doctors.  My doctor cares about what is the best for me.
-1	Ultimately, I trust my primary care physician. He has more knowledge than I do and a medical degree, so I will trust him or get a second opinion if it were a really big deal.
-1	In my experience, doctors tend care less about their patients if their patients have free health care. When I did, the doctor I had kept trying to convince me to get as few tests done as possible, and never told me the results of those tests. Whereas if I had been paying out of pocket or had really good insurance, they probably would have given me every test in the book whether I asked for it or not. They have also been far too dismissive. When I go to a doctor, I want to know if a problem is real or in my head. If the doctor says there's nothing physically wrong with me, then that gives me a way to understand what's going on with me. But a doctor that refuses to help is a pointless doctor to spend your time and money on.
-1	It always seems that doctors are rushed. I don't think that they always have patients best interest in mind. Paying more attention to the bottom line than well being of patients. 
1	i would never have complete total trust in a doctor. i have to look things up myself, i have to be able to confirm or deny
1	I switched doctors a few years ago after 5 years of suffering from a mystery illness. She had it figured out in a few months and got me feeling good as new. Her treatment since has been great
-1	I trust them to do the right thing whenever possible. Listening to a patient explain their problems is utmost in doctors minds to assist them in recovery.
-1	I don't distrust my doctor so much, I just know that he is a human being and doesn't have all of the information. My doctor has a family so when he leaves the office he is not doing research on new treatments or new information. I like my doctor I just think that he is a little out of date and doesn't take the time to educated himself on new medical practices or even new nutritiol information.
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for 11 years.  I trust his decisions where my healthy is concerned and he has been right on.
1	I have had the same PCP for about 5 years and she has never made me feel rushed and always asks thorough questions about the status of my health. When I have had any problems she made sure to order the appropriate testing.
1	I trust my physician because of my experience with her. I always have the final decision about my own care.
1	I have been with the same doctor for 11 years and he has never given me any reason to not trust him - he is very thorough and concise in his diagnoses and gives me the best overall advice and information that I could ever hope for with any doctor. 
1	I have over 10 years of history with my doctor. She's one of those doctor who believes that no matter how well a patient looks there is some kind of problem or that patient wouldn't be here.
-1	Physicians are people and they make mistakes. They can be persuaded with money and gifts to be biased towards certain treatments. They can have fincial interests that bias them towards treatments, too.
1	My doctor is always willing to listen to my concerns even when there are many patients out in the waiting, even though I try not to waste his time.
-1	I have very mixed feelings when it comes to this. I sometimes feel that they are genuinly worried about what is wrong when on the flipside I have had moments where I feel that they are just trying to make it through appoinmtnets or just make quick money. 
-1	Trust him because he will find the right medication instead of just giv g one and hoping it will eventually work. He also wants the right dosage and will keep checking to make sure they work
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for several years. I find him to be trustworthy. His diagnosis and treatments have been helpful. 
-1	I believe she has my best interest at heart, but with so many patients she is often rushed and frazzled. I worry that she is sacrificing accuracy for speed.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very smart, well qualified, and she knows what shes doing. The office that I go to is also very well known, and its been around for years so I trust them. They are all very professional, clean, and enthusiastic in their practice their.
1	I have been around physicians all my life. Iâve volunteered in hospitals, worked in hospitals, job-shadowed various doctors, and have numerous doctors as colleagues (Iâm in medical school). I have a primary care physician and whenever I have a checkup etc. with my own knowledge I know he tells me the truth and shows a caring side, and answers all my questions. Trust is earned, and I believe (since I am doing it), with all the education doctors go through, trust should be there, because it is a respected occupation. 
-1	I an neutral to most doctors because they are in it for the money. The more medications they proscribed the more money in their pockets 
1	I completely trust my doctor. I believe that if you don't trust them,  u should find one that you do. Mine gives me an honest opinion, backed by facts and not just suggestions. They give me solid advise and are patient with me. They take the time to sit with u and listen to your problems and questions. Thru don't always want to shove a pill down your throat, they respect my natural path of doing things. 
-1	I trust somewhat because of professiol training but sometimes I feel like they have so much on their shoulders that they might just write off some of my concerns and think of the first thing that comes on their mind to solve my problem so they can get to the next patient
1	I have been using my doctor since I was a child.it was our family doctor and I have kind of grown with him as I have aged.he has always been right
-1	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor and that was more about billing and paperwork than the actual care. When a doctor gives me an opinion I generally accept it and follow their advice. So far in life that has not let me down.
-1	I am in control of my health and I like to do research on what the doctor is saying rather than blindly trusting them. 
-1	My PCP means well (and I do not at all mean that as a sarcastic comment) but like most PCPs in the days of managed care plans, he is overworked and cannot take the time to really get to know each patient thus some critical things can fall through the cracks unless I make a point of bringing them up to him.  Otherwise, he just orders blood work every three months and bases his whole appointment with me on the bloodwork results instead of, for example, looking at the fact that as a 60 year old woman with severe osteoporosis (due to my osteogenesis imperfecta) I am supposed to be having annual bone density scans.   I have to bring up things like bone density scans, mammograms, etc. to him myself because if it is not a blood test result, it will fall through the cracks.   In his defense, I will say, he orders thorough blood tests, goes over the results with me to make sure I understand them and when I do bring up something outside of the blood tests, he listens and works with me on it.  He is a good doctor, just overworked.  I don't trust him to be aware of my health conditions.  I do trust him to work with me when I remind him of what is going on with me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has known me for over twenty years.  He is aware of all my medical issues and takes care to make sure i am getting the best care possible.
-1	My physician is currently near the end of her fifth pregnancy and sheâs pretty tired.  I expect things will get better but Iâve been relying more on her nurse practitioner.
1	I love my Primary Care Physician. I had been to a ton of doctors and was miserable. I saw her twice and she figured out what had wrong with me for a long time. One medication completely changed my life. She saved me. I trust her completely. But doctors in general, I only half trust them. You never know when you get a screwy one. 
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part; however, they are not God.  They make mistakes, get tired, and have lives like the rest of us.  I believe in second opinions and self educating.  
1	My primary care physician spends a lot of time with me.  He has even come in on his day off to see me.  He listens to my opinions, respects them, and is open in discussing issues with me.
-1	I am currently between primary care physicians because my insurance coverage and physical location has changed several times recently. But when I did have a regular primary care physician(s) which I did for many years, I felt that in general I could trust them. However, in all cases I do my own research and use logic whenever possible. I try to avoid any and all medications, which I feel is too often the focus of physicians, to push drugs. For that reason, I canât say that I ever have complete trust in a doctor.  I take pretty much anything a physician might say or do with a âgrain of saltâ, always considering the possibility that the drug factor could be playing a significant role.
1	Sometimes they can be telling you the truth. But sometimes they can be telling you lie. So you have to reach it frist.
1	I have gone to him for years and he listens to my concerns and acts on them. He knows if I complain, there is usually something wrong. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel that he cares about me and wants to help me
-1	Sometimes I feel I want to trust what she says but other times I feel like she's not even aware of my problems. She tends to focus on things that don't need to be done versus helping me with my true problems. I feel she is overwhelmed with other things and patients and I am just a number on a chart and not a real person.  
-1	I feel like I need to trust them because that is what they have studied and trained to do for many years. Though I have experienced negative situations in hospitals that have made me feel somewhat distrustful. I have been present in situations where a doctor has taken too long or has not demonstrated much importance when trying to be reached with questions. Sometimes they have so many situations going on at once, that it would seem they forget some patients.
-1	I believe after being in a practice for a long time, everything is routine. I don't feel like they give as much thought into my complaints as they should. I don't go into the doctor for any old little thing, if I go, I am severely concerned. Their concern never matches my concern.
1	"I trust my primary care physician. He is always available via the electronic portal and will respond to me within hours, sometimes even on the weekend. Sometimes an initial treatment plan won't work, but he is always ready with ""plan B"". He also makes sure I'm on schedule with preventative care (physicals, etc.)"
1	My doctor seems to care about me and my conditions. He does not rush through talking to me and actually listens to what I have to say. 
-1	For the last several years I have primarily seen a pain management specialist.  I feel like it has been write a prescription rather than deal with the problems. Then when the attitudes began to change about medicating chronic pain patients it became trying to stop giving me medication. At no time have I felt my best interests were served.  I would prefer a more middle of the road approach. 
1	I have been going to the same primary care physician for years.  I've never had a problem or reason to not trust him with my care.
-1	she give me good information and describe my condition perfectly. In addition, she tells me what will work and what will not work.    
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for ten years and, while I haven't always taken his recommendations, I always know why he offers them. I have implicit trust in his judgement and he never fails to take my concerns into account. 
-1	I used to trust my doctor, but had to go to a new one when the old one retred. I'm not certain that I fully trust the younger new physician I am using.
-1	I have a lack of trust with my GP.   She recommends one thing while my gynecologist, neurologist, and allergist recommend other avenues 
-1	I feel like I'm just another dollar to my doctor not a person needing help. When I see her she's always busy with other things that she can't fully put her focus on me 
-1	Diagnosing a health issue is not very clear cut. Doctors may give their best guess at what's wrong but may be wrong. Getting an accurate diagnosis can involve a lot of testing, trial and error, or repeat visits. Doctors may take short cuts and prescribe medication based on what is most commonly seen rather than what may be most appropriate in a situation. For example, prescribing antibiotics when presented with generic cold symptoms (which may be caused by a virus).
-1	A physician can be trusted for the most part because you've had this physician for a long time, and therefore have developed a good relationship.
1	I think they know what is wrong with me and give them my complete trust. I think that if a doctor don't know what is wrong they should ask another doctor for help in figuring out what is wrong.
-1	I don't have a PCP, but do feel that most doctors are looking out for their patients' best interests and can be trusted.
1	My nephrologist gives me 1000% because she knows that I am not afraid to take my illness head on. She has been my doctor for 20 years now. She is caring, sympathetic, understanding, kind and just a fantastic human being. I am very blessed to have her on my angel team. She is always upfront and honest.
-1	I've recently switched doctors and only seen the new one once so I haven't formed a real solid opioion yet, but so far she seems nice and interested and takes her time and listens when I talk so far all is good. Time will tell. 
1	Trust my doctor because she talks to me about my options, makes me feel comfortable, and explains procedures in detail. My doctor has given me no reason to distrust them 
1	I trust my doctor because they explain everything I need to know and even give me options if I dnt agree with something they are telling me. He doesn't rush my visit and he listens to all the problems and concerns I have.
1	Overall, I trust my physician.  That isn't to say that I won't seek out more information on a subject after getting my physician's opinion.  I will take what she tells me as a stepping point to learning more for myself.  My physician has shown to be open to Western Culture health care in addition to Eastern Culture health care, and that matters to me.  She is always warm and kind, and strikes me as genuine.
-1	I feel some doctors don't know what there doing. I would like someone who is experienced or at least able to explain to me what i am taking
1	My primary care physician has a complete understanding of my medical history and of the available treatment options, including vaccinations
1	My doctor has known me since I was young and knows my entire medical history. He always takes the time to go over my symptoms and questions with me.
-1	She listens to me and she is always available to answer question or to find the answers for me that she may not know.  
1	My doctor has been reliable and honest with me.  She does not hesitate to question me when I have not followed her advice
1	My primary care Doctor is great. She spends a lot of time with me and monitors my health very closely! She is really caring and gets really excited if I eat healthy and drop weight and get my BP down and my cholestral down. She is a nice person and if she is late she will apologise when she comes in unlike most Doctors!
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician because I switched insurance providers and still need to select one.  Basically, I've seen too many things go wrong with friends and relatives' doctors, and I'm pretty paranoid about doctors in general. I inherently don't trust them and want to avoid them. Also, I think I have a form of hypochondria where I'm always afraid of something being wrong and so just want to avoid it.
-1	I feel very neutral about my trust towards my primary car physician. I can not whole heartedly put all my faith into them. That why I strive to get second opinions if something does go wrong. I go see a specialist in order to better understand, and make sure I am not being misdiagnosed. There have been instances when I do not believe my doctor has made the right decision such as not prescribing the right dosage of a medication, and I have struggled to come to terms with that. Until then I still go cause its a convenient location, and accepts my insurance.
-1	We I go to the doctors I can say I trust in the most of the time especially if they are experience doctors
1	I trust my doctor because I have a long relationship with her, she has shown me that she is capable. She has helped me many times.
1	I have been seeing the same physicians for over 30 years. I have complete trust in them and am comfortable that they treat my family as well. I would be very disappointed if I had to find another physican(s).
-1	I mainly trust doctors, but I don't doubt that some of them aren't completely honest. At the end of the day, they are getting a paycheck from sick people.
1	My primary care physician never makes me feel rushed when I have an appointment. She listens to my concerns and always asks if I have questions. I believe she is intelligent and keeps up with new developments in medicine.
-1	When I had a life threatening illness my doctor made sure they monitored my condition  every step of the way.
1	For the most part I trust doctors.  The challenging limitation to my answers is that the VA has cycled through many contract physicians who - individually are intellegent and compassionate - are not around long enough to have a consisted convesation/relationship.
-1	I feel like sometimes my physician takes the extreme treatment option first, as in, wanting to do surgery immediately, versus taking a less invasive option first and seeing if it works. I often feel like my physician has one foot out the door because there are too many other patients waiting to be seen. I would rather weigh all of my options and start with the lest invasive option, and move further up the scale if it is needed.
1	I have used this doctor for many years and he has always guided me correctly and medical directions I need.
1	I feel my Dr. always listens to me and seems very caring. She always takes her time and is not in a hurry to get to the next patent. She explains everything more then once and always ask me if I have any questions and if I do when I get home to call or email her. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they discuss every aspect of my health with me. They also answer any questions I may have. 
1	My doctor listens to me and cares for me.  He always make sure all my questions are answered.  He tends to all my needs and wants.
-1	They came highly recommended and has great reviews. They are local and they take good care of me. I do appreciate how they handle my plan of care. 
-1	My doctor tends to focus on one specific ailment at a time. I might go in for one thing but that issue would be pushed to the back to address the ailment she is focused on treating at that time. 
-1	Doctors are only interested in what your insurance can cover-period! It's very difficult to find a decent doctor who will consider what is best for the patient and sometimes their treatment is worst than the decease itself!
-1	My physician has forgotten medical information about me, and had to be retold. Also, my physician has said offensive things that seem to step across the line of patient and doctor relationship. I haven't switched because I'm only living here for one year and hopefully don't get sick until I move. Finding a new physician would take too long to get in. So I don't really trust my physician.
-1	He's a very caring and professional man, but I'm not sure if he chooses the right treatments for me. 
1	My physician is a great doctor. He has done everything in his power to help me where others have failed or didn't want to.
-1	My doctor is patient and takes the time to answer any questions I might have. I never feel rushed in his office. He also never seems pushy, and gives me all of my potential options. He's never pushed a medication or treatment on me. His bedside manner is excellent.
1	I trust what my Doctor tells me as I have been a patient of hers for a number of years. 
1	There are instances or maybe rare instances that I did not trust my doctor one time because all he/she ever gave me was simple remedy that I could have just researched in the internet.
-1	some doctors if they see you at least five times or more, and nothing has change    in your health   after the doctor has advise you what to do, the tend to give up on you, and they stop giving you the info you really need to hear from them.
1	Doctor is open, honest and explains all situations and answers my questions and concerns. Provides for all necessary tests and labs
1	I trust doctors to make the best decisions for their patients if they are given all the information that is available.
-1	I have to have a cat scan in a few months for my back, and I had already gotten an X-Ray, my doctor says I should have a Cat scan, but I'm very small. I think a cat scan will be too powerful for my back and very harmful to my body, but my doctor didn't think differently. I hope when doctors make these decisions they think realistically with their patients. 
-1	It is not that I do not trust my doctor, however, I am aware that my doctor is only trained in western medicine. I am open to remedies and treatments that western medicine may not be knowledgeable about or have believe works. I know that my doctor is limited due to their training. 
-1	I haven't gone to this new doctor as much and it takes time to build up trust and believing in the professional. Too many doctors get bought out by pharmaceutical companies and leave out some other medications that could help you if need be. I am not all conspiracy gung ho but I need time to build trust
-1	I think people should have trust in doctors because they went to school for their practices. O have full trust in my primary care physicians 
1	I trust my doctor because he is straight forward and doesn't hold back he spends more than 15 mins with me talking out my options of care or of medication
-1	i trust in the physician completely. i hope they give me all the info i need to now. i can trust them they look like they can give me all the info i need to know.
1	My doctor always has time to listen  to what's going on with my health ..between the two of us, she comes up with favorable conclusions
-1	In most circumstances I put my faith in my doctor's opinion, though I am aware that physicians are often bribed by pharmaceutical companies in effort to increase prescriptions written for their given product.  As such I always like to do my own research or get a 2nd opinion on said issues.
-1	My PCP is associated with a family practice facility that trains family practice physicians.  He is attentive and represents what I would expect of a family practice physician.
1	HE IS VERY THOROUGH AND CARING. TRUST HIM COMPLETELY. HE IS VERY PROACTIVE, FOLLOWS UP ON EVERYTHING.
1	I have been going to my doctor for over twenty years. He's the best doctor I have ever had. He will always tell me the truth about my health conditions and what kind of treatment is needed for them. He will then let me decide which one I want. He never suggests a treatment that I do not need. The two times I have gone through cancer, he was extremely helpful and caring. At appointments, he always takes his time with me and other patients. In other words, he does not rush through them as some doctors do.
-1	I respect the intellect of medical advisory of physicians however I have faith greater than any man. I trust that people are in me path of life for a reason whether it's a doctor teacher etc. Subconsciously only believing in faith as my provider of knowledge.
-1	My current primary care doctor is only concerned with my weight. In her mind any issue that arises could be solved if I would lose some weight. She always makes sure the address my weight at each visit and ensure that I am aware of the negative ways that being overweight could affect me. She assumes that I will become addicted to certain medications just because I am overweight.
-1	at times I feel I am not being heard and the appointments are rushed and then other times I feel like I am being referred to other doctors to have tests possibly done, when my prmary care doctor could just order the test
1	in the end she usually is right. if I did not trust her I would get a new doctor. so far I have no reason not to trust her.
-1	i trust my doctor because she is very edicated and have a big experience and all time when she gave me some medication this is work very well
-1	I trust her because she trusts me. I feel that I can talk to her honestly, and I expect her to be blunt in return. Most recently, she was worried about my cholesterol level but I was reluctant to go on new meds. She agreed that I could try to bring it down with lifestyle changes, so she gave me some diet tips instead of a prescription. With changes in diet and exercise, I brought it down 53 points. 
-1	My doctor has never been wrong about my diagnosis when it's something specific to me. Alot of time when many people come in with the same issue they just group everyone together as having the same thing.
1	I trust my doctor because he has never told me information that he could not back up with scientific and medical proof.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been my doctor for many years and I'm still alive. I trust none doctor to take care of me n cause he's educated and experienced. 
-1	My current Primary Care Physician is not even a physician.  She is only a nurse practitioner.  Every time Iâve gone to see her she has literally said âI just donât know what to tell you.â  âIâm not really sure what is going onâ.  After she did some research online, she came to the same conclusion that I already had by searching online.
-1	I see a nurse practitioner in a clinic and he always takes time with me, never seems in a rush. Willing to get things tested if I wish, if it's not an urgent matter. 
1	Out of the plethora of doctors I have seen in my life, only two stand out; one I used to see in another state before we moved and my current doctor.  My current doctor tells it like it is and doesn't sugar-coat anything.  Actually, he is quite assertive with me and I respond well to that.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are suppose to have my best interest at hand. They are all that I have to trust when it comes to my health.
-1	While I sometimes feel like I'm another patient being flown through the door, and husled along. My doctor usually is very thorough and will sit and discuss anything that I need to talk about.
-1	overall I think doctors are trust worthy but there are a few sketchy doctors out there and that makes people not want to trust any of them. 
1	She has entered in to a relationship with me with goal setting and holding me accountable, she's not just passive.
1	He has never told me nothing false and is straight forward with me and my health is pretty good according to him and he never sad or did anything for me not to trust him
1	most doctors are in it because of the money and don't the job as serious and mature like they should be
-1	I don't trust ANYONE with my health besides myself.  If there is something I need to know, then I reach out for answers, then go back to caring for myself the way it should be.
1	I've been going to the same doctor for 12 years and I completely trust her opinion. She takes her time with me and listens to everything I say. Since I had my children, she also cares for them and does a great job with them.
-1	I have been recently assigned a new provider. As far as I can tell, he is a very competent doctor. He has been very helpful in my medications and I have not experienced any problems under this current provider.
1	My doctor has gained my trust within the past year by discovering a serious problem with my thyroid in the process of examining me for rhumatism. I would not have known this if he had not taken the trouble to examine my blood tests carefully and sent me for more specific tests. This process has definitely made me trust his competence and thoroughness.
1	He is suppose to be my adviser for the best possible medical and physical health I can achieve.  So I should trust his judgement on the topic of my medical and physical health.
-1	Doctors these days hardly spend any time dealing with you. They tend to rush in and out without taking much time to offer up explations or reasons for what they are doing. It seems that most often it is left up the the nurses or the PA to answer your questions because the doctor has to be doing other things. I also feel like they don't want to give you altertives or other possible options in fear of being sued.
-1	This person seems to be pretty objective in their decisions. I don't see them as the kind of doctor to recommend a lot of unnecessary tests. They mostly seem to want what is good for me.
1	I have had nothing but a stellar experience for 8 years with my primary doctor.She has gone above and beyond her duties when I have concerns, I completely trust her.
1	I tend to trust my physical because he feels like he is knowledgeable. He also doesn't seem like someone who rushes through patients. He takes the time to answer any questions I might have. He seems to care.
1	I have been seeing the same primary care doctor since I was a child. I have complete faith in my doctor and will always take his suggestions and recommendations to heart.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for quite a few years now. She knows me well, and I trust that she will do what is best for my health. She is also available to talk to outside of office hours which is really great.
1	I always trust my doctor she has never turned me in the wrong direction always explains things and has got my health under control
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for 15 years.  I find him very trustworthy and have never had a problem with anything he has said.
-1	For the most part, I trust her because she is a doctor and hasn't given me reason not to yet. However... we did just switch doctors and have only seen our current doctor twice. We had to switch due to insurance coverage, but our previous doctor I had been with for 5 years and trusted completely. I hope to develop the same relationship with our current family doctor.
-1	For most of my life I have neither had nor needed a PCP.  My Medicare Advantage plan required one so I recently contacted a doctor and set up the necessary steps to have him as my PCP.  First meeting impressions and results were good but without a long-term relationship I cannot rate my level of trust/distrust
-1	My doctor is usually very good at explaining the mechanisms behind any diagnosis she give. But, when I got bloodwork done she completely overlooked something that has been shown to give symptoms that I was having. She immediately prescribed medication rather than trying to find out what the cause of my abnormal bloodwork was.
1	I have had the same Doctor for 15 years and she has never been wrong and always tells me the truth so I trust her.
1	My primary care physician has always been great. She is very personable and honest. She reccomends nothing but the best for me. I am very thankful to have found a doctor like her
-1	I like how my doctor treat me. And when I ask him for something he does it. And I don't have to wait when I need things.
-1	He goes over things with me.  He's caring and talks to me alot.  I like that and think he's telling me the truth.
1	I can't think of a time when I didn't trust a physician. I have had good experiences with the different doctors I have used for different medical situations throughout my life.
-1	I trust my PCP because I value their opinion a lot, I've been a patient with them for awhile and they always give me options
-1	i dont noif i would trust them but before i do i have to sit and talkto them first and then see if i trust him or her
1	I have been with my doctor for many years through everything I have been through if she didn't know the answer she would always ask for help or investigate to get the answer I have never had any problems with her judgement or decision.
-1	I have been seeing them for many years.
1	My doctor has always been very well educated on any problems that i've had. He is very intuitive and understanding and will always give me an honest answer regardless of the situation. His dedication to his patients has been simply amazing.
1	I trust my medical doctor because of my intuition and also because of the accumulation of medical, professional certification.
-1	My rheumatologist is the doctor that I trust the most. He is very knowledgeable and it is obvious that he cares about his patients. He actually save my mother's life at one point because he recognized that she had a rare condition that the other doctors had not seen before. He is very honest about treatments, side effects and possible outcomes and works very hard to find the right treatment for the individual patient.
-1	I generally trust them but at the end of the day they are they to make money and not just to help me or  to make me feel better so I have to take everything they say or recommend or do with a grain of salt and seek other opinions
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because outside of the fact that he's gone to school for a long time to be a medical professional and knows a heck of a lot more than me, he also seems like a good person, who actually cares about his patients. The only reason I don't have complete trust of him, is he's still human, and humans make mistakes. Even Doctors.That being said, even though I trust him, and the diagnoses he may make, or the medication he may put me on. I'm still going to do my own research on the topics at home.
1	MY PHYSICIAN KNOWS ME BY NAME.  HE IS AN INTEGRATED PHYSICIAN AND LOOKS AT NUTRITION AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL MEDICINE.  HE LOOKS AT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM NOT JUST A REGULATING MEDICATION. 
-1	My primary care physician has proven himself to be reliable, knowledgeable, and if was unsure about something would admit it and find out the information. That is why I can trust him because he is willing to admit when he doesn't know and willing to find out the information. That how I know I have a good doctor because he doesn't have a god complex.
1	Although some doctors give false medical treatment, I think my doctor is very passionate and caring about what he does. 
-1	if you dont have insurance you get very lil consideration because the doctors think that you are not important enough for them to bother with you 
-1	I don't trust them because They only prescribe medication as treatment and only see you briefly. I trust them because they know more than me and they are supposed to be concerned about my health 
-1	I find it to be the most useful and helpful when i am able to explain all the things that i need and make sure the doctor knows what i need.
-1	It just seems doctors are to eager to get to the next patient. They never spend enough time with you.
-1	Doctors are just people. Some good, some not so good. I believe todays doctors are overworked and do not have enough time to spend quality time with individual patients.
-1	sometimes i really dont trust doctore for the fact they never listen to what you have to say how you really feel , 
-1	Doctors are good for diagnoses, but prescribing medication is one thing I do not trust doctors in this area. I believe medications are prescribed for the doctors benefit, not the patient.
1	My doctor is thorough and honest with me, and discuuses every current issue if any, and reviews all issues in the past...so very happy with my care from my primary physician...
-1	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. But sometimes doctors make choices based on insurance issues, drug company promotion, and other things that are not always good for my general well being.
-1	It is not that I distrust them. I know that they have many patients, and that their attention cannot be 100 percent on me. It is my own responsibility to make sure that I am doing everything I can to keep myself healthy. They have a lot of patients, but I only have me.
-1	I have trust in his ability as a doctor and his medical doctor, but he is a very busy doctor in a poor neighborhood, so it can be hard to keep his attention on something that doesn't seem very bad from an outside perspective. 
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but most doctors are trustworthy if you have history with them. New patients tend to get the low end of care.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I don't feel like I can trust any doctor after previous experiences with bad doctors. However, I feel like my doctor genuinely wants to help me and cares about what happens to me, I just don't think they always tell me what my best option of treatment is all the time, etc.
1	My doctor has always given me a real prognosis and I appreciate that. My clinical doctor has always checked my neck and given me through physicals to make me feel at ease. Any bumps or pains are always checked, and he makes me feel comfortable. 
-1	I haven't had any reason not to trust my doctor. I have been traveling with the same physician for a number of years and he has been open and honest do fat
-1	I have a new doctor that I do not know very well. She is very friendly and seems competent. However, I would still ask questions to be sure that the right decisions were bring made about my health. I would never just blindly trust my doctor without understanding the information.
1	I have always followed her advice and listened to what she prescribes for me, and I never have an issue. She is smart and very observant. She cares about how she takes care of her patients and she also cares how my other doctors (specialists) are taking care of me.
1	 do not currently have a PC. in general i trust doctors because they are more knowledgeable than i am. this does not mean i do not see the value in second opinions, however, i recognize these are trained professionals who have a better understanding of any health issue i might have.
-1	My GP is fairly new at this practice. She is a NP and I think she gets a little hesitant about making decisions on what medication to give you. This in turn makes me nervous. Overall, I trust doctors but I also arm myself with knowledge. I will not take a new medication without researching it. Doctors do not have the time to know everything there is about a medicine they're prescribing. So, a pharmacist and research can be your best friend when it comes to your health.
-1	I am very open with my physician so I tend to trust him with most decisions, but it's my body and I want to have the fil say. I believe that all people are inherently selfish, and so I am scared that if I let my guard down, people will take advantage of me. I'm not a trusting person, so even if I agree with my doctor on a major issue, like surgery, I would still want to go to another doctor and get a second opinion, because my health is very important to me. 
-1	My doctor usually gives me the news straight and goes over treatment plans.  I have seen my health improve in the last 2 years since going to this doctor so I trust future advise he gives me. 
-1	I feel that my doctor, who is nearing the end of her career (upper 60's) and thinking about retirement in the next year or two is no longer placing my needs first.  I think she's having some sort of compassion fatigue and it doing a lot of things that are easier for her rather than giving me the proper care I am paying for and deserve.  I've gone to this doctor for over 20 years and it's difficult to see this happen however, I think the end of this doctor patient relationship is near either due to her impending retirement or me finding a replacement prior.
1	My doctor has been helping me and my mother for years and has only recommended things in my best interest. If I hadn't moved away from home I would still use her as my main physician.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for a couple years and she has never steered me wrong. I believe she has my best interest along with her other patients best interest in mind. 
-1	I have had terrible medical experiences for the last twenty years and I finally have a great Dr who will spend hours with me if necessary and appears to actually care how I am doing. 
-1	The few times I have visited the doctor I have felt a sense of urgency from them as if they were too busy for my time. I also feel like they do not care as much as they should, too many times have I experienced a doctor telling me a bunch of information at once like they were a robot, not making any eye contact with me through the lecture. 
-1	he tells me everything needed for each visit why and the whats in very detailed and common English which is very easy to under stand
1	I trust my primary doctor because I never usually have anything wrong happen when I go to him, when I explain my problem he is usually able to tell me what is wrong. 
-1	some doctors just want you there so they can get paid as long as you are coming to see them and tthey give you medicine you have to keep coming back
1	She tells me exactly how she feels and makes sure that I receive all the tests I need to take.  She is available to me 7/24.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has my best interest at heart. He makes sure that I receive the information and care that I need to make health decisions.
-1	I currently do not have a primary care physician and have not seen one in over 20 years.  I can not afford medical insurance for myself at the moment.
-1	I find that my PCP is quite busy, and my time with him is limited.   I also find that the information he (and other PCP(s) I have dealt with) offers is not complete, and that I better understand medical issue(s) by conducting additiol research on my own, and also seeking specialist referral(s) and appropriate testing. 
1	I've known him since I was a kid. He's been my family and personal doctor for over 30 years and I trust him. He's helped me through quite a few issues and struggles.
1	I trust my doctor because they always take the time that they need in order to help me, even if they are backed up.   They never rush me.  They make sure that all of my questions are answered.
1	He makes the time to talk with me and ask me if I have any questions. He never seems to be in a rush or rush me. He has made good decisions for me in the past.
-1	I don't trust or distrust a physician. I simply demand what is best for me and require the utmost sincere honesty. Otherwise I change physicians 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him since I was a kid and he has been truthful and honest ever since. He has also been my family's primary care physician.
1	It at all will be the same way of furture and it will be the same way the sun will work and ur sun and the best way to come though and it was the same way to become true and it way   
-1	after searching, found one who seems to understand what I need/feel about care from a physician, and after lengthy discussions with him, we have reached a level of understanding and mutual respect for each of out decisions.
-1	I want to trust doctors as their job is so important and I would like to believe that they know that and always want to do the best thing but not all people do the right things and people get into some industries for all the wrong reasons. 
-1	I recently had to change primary care doctor's because the one that had been my doctor for many years retired. The new doctor that I have does not seem that dependable. As a matter of fact, I am in the processing of finding a different one.
-1	Its important to me to have a good relationship and a strong degree of trust with a chosen physician.  I'm relying on the physician to take good care of me and use good judgment.  They do the best they can I'm sure.  The patient too, has an active role in the relationship so try to do my best as well.
1	The doctor seems quite professional and knowledgeable. And seems to be genuinely interested in hearing what I have to say.
1	I generally trust doctors and trust their professiolism most of all. I think they have more insight and I don't feel like I have to challenge it or anything like that.
-1	I currently do not have a primary care physician for the simple fact that I can't find one who is willing to look past their training and realize that not everybody is an identical copy of another. Most of the ones I have encountered are medicine pushers. For those who can't, or would rather not take traditiol forms of western medicine, finding a doctor who believes or takes you seriously is a very difficult task. 
-1	Some doctors give misleading advice, so my trust in doctors are not that high. But I've rarely been to a doctor so I don't know by personal experience.
-1	I don't have a primary care doctor at the moment because the one I previously went to didn't seem to fully care about my well-being. He would listen to my symptoms and immediately gave me a prescription which then gave me more side effects.
-1	Haven't found a good doctor yet and I'm still looking for a health facilities that have transportation
-1	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mind. He listens to my ideas and mulls them over thoughtfully, sometimes challenging my logic but most often agreeing with me. we decide on courses of action together, taking in my mind my needs and objections. we have built trust together in this way.
1	I trust my doctorsâ because they know how to take care of me, take care of my needs and give me the right medicines and care.
-1	I would trust him. Unless your instincts say otherwise
1	There's no reason for me not to trust my doctor. I haven't had any ill experiences, and she always seems willing to answer any questions that I may have in regards to procedures or medications.
-1	In American society, doctors are too easily swayed but money. I don't trust them to provide me with the care I need if I don't have insurance or the amount of money that want. It seems so odd that we have to buy our health, like the common man is owned but the powers that be. 
1	I can always trust my doctor they brevet failed me on anything. That's why I'm so healthy now. They do a full check on me and tell me what they can give me to fix the problem and if t doesn't work come back and they have another solution.
1	I have been seeing the same doctor since I was a young adult, he's always been kind, and comes of caring and astute. My doctor has never given me a reason to question his decisions. 
-1	I trust doctors like I trust policemen: i was brought up to trust them
-1	being 71 i always look forward to seeing the doctor asking questions and making sure i understand the answers
1	The doctor takes time to explain and discuss plans encouraging questions and feedback so that I'm informed about choices
1	I have known and used the same primary care physician for over 30 years. I have high confidence in my Dr. based upon many years of interaction.
-1	I'd like to trust my doctor more. The issue is that he sees so many patients I often feel like a number. He gets in a rush during appointments. I trust him as far as I can, but I'd prefer to have a doctor that could give me more individualized attention. Sadly that isn't an option for me at this time.
1	He has gone above and beyond for me. He has made referrals to several places, ordered tests, and tried to get to the bottom of my health issues
-1	My mother is a doctor. I love my mother very much, but I realize that doctors aren't magicians, and they are very much people too. I see her run short on patience for her patients---I see how things like drug seeking behaviour make her suspicious of many patients. I think many doctors probably feel this way, and it makes me wary of trusting them. 
1	I fully trust my physician, I've been going to him for years! He is thorough during my visits, he tries treating disorders/illnesses/conditions without medication first, then if that doesn't work he will prescribe medication. He is totally honest and informative!
-1	I trust doctors to some extent to in most cases try to help. However I do feel they sometimes think of themselves or money they make from kickbacks 
-1	My primary care physician is a nice woman who listens to me. She will direct me to many specialists.  She, however, does not treat very often.  She goes over the records of other doctors, etc.  
-1	I could only say that I can't agree totally on number one because I have personally seen that my doctor's waiting room was empty without patients being seen at the time and have still been made to wait excessive amounts of time for my own appointments on numerous occasions.
-1	I trust him because he is a good doctor that has always been able to treat what I am to see him for.  He is been in the same place for many years and has many patients so he must know what he is doing to stay in the same place for so long retaining so many patients.
1	I trust my primary care physician. He has never been wrong about any medical condition I have ever had. He always explains everything that he feels may be complicated to understand. He always answers all of my questions very thoroughly.
-1	I have a terrible list of back problems and the doctor is afraid to give me anything stronger because of all of the opiod addiction in the country, even though I've never done anything wrong. so he keeps giving me expensive medicines that don't work and wont listen to me when i talk to him. he seems in a hurry to get me out of the office.  
1	My primary physician always explains in great detail all information that I need to take care of any medical condition I might be having
-1	i distruct my primary care physcian because i see a different person each time. I never have someone who knows me. I'm always explaining things. It's like im a car and the mechanic is different each time.
-1	I find that my PCP has a genuine interest to see that I am as healthy as I can be.  She listens to my problems and seems to expend the appropriate amount of concern and energy into solving my problems.  She will also freely give prescriptions or referrals when I need to see a specialist.
-1	always spend as much time with me that I need and answers all of my questions as far as my medical conditions
-1	Every time I go to the doctor they seem to be in a bad mood. I don't quite know but their face is always that of a person when they are angry and do not want to be bothered. This leads me to not ask any questions about how I feel health-wise. I end up leaving without getting the input I need most of the time.
1	I've had my doctor for a long time. She always listens when i want to talk and has given me excellent advice in the past.
-1	I feel like I listen to what they say but then wait to form my own opinion on it. I haven't always had doctors give me accurate diagnoses. Sometimes I have to do my own research and tell them what I have before they can tell me themselves.
1	My doctor seems straightforward and trustworthy. I feel no reason to doubt him.
-1	He is highly regarded by those close to me. A lot of friends and family use the same doctor, and have high praise for him as well. 
-1	She appears to be genuinely concerned about my well being. She is approachable and personable. She takes time with me, listens to me, and thoroughly explains.
-1	Sometimes I feel like my primary care physician only wants to hurry up and move onto the next patient.
-1	My doctor has always been there for me. She tells me what is wrong(if there is anything wrong) and answers all my worrying questions.
1	Someone I and comfortable with and trust their medical judgement. They listen to my concerns and address them and does not blow me off.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician anymore. I don't really get sick. I just kinda play things by ear and go from there.
-1	I find that doctors are quick to prescribe medication for symptoms that can be maged otherwise.  I feel it's unnecessary in some cases.  When I have spoken to my doctor about altertive or tural medicine, she is quick to deny it's efficacy, but when I use it, it works.  There have also been times I had to self diagnos because my doctors weren't thoroughly looking into my symptoms.
-1	I have read her background and i trust her. I also trust the organization that she works for. She is very thorough and knowledgeable about womens health
-1	I trust physicians because they understand my personal feelings and thoughts. It feels like having a true close friend when I have a physician who perfectly understands my problems and is patient with me.
-1	I think my doctor is honest with me about my condition. But as medication is concern is not giving me the medication treatment that I think is best for me. I think because of other health problem that I have he is cautious.
-1	i've had a variety of different primary care physicians and this varies for all of them - but sometimes i do get the sense that they're not being very thorough or diligent and just wanting to see the next patient
1	My doctor is a very down to earth person. I think that he and I have a lot in common. We are able to talk freely with him and have agreed on almost everything that we have every talked about. The decisions that he has made thus far I have agreed with and would anticipate that he would continue to make decisions in the future that I agree with.
1	I cannot imagine any physician not having a patients best interest.  There are many avenues to go if that is not the case.  
1	I see my PCP every 60 to 90 days for migraines. He will listen to my every need or issue. Often I may have something else nagging me (back pain, neck pain) and no matter what he will address these issues and guide me in the right direction. 
1	I trust my primary physician because they always walk me through all of my options with any issue I may be having. I never feel pushed into taking medicine or doing something I am not comfortable with. They answer all my questions and make me feel secure and knowledgeable in my health choices.
-1	"I just sometimes feel that my doctor and doctors in general are in a rush. They do what they always do to treat certain problems. If their treatment doesn't work, then ""oh well."" I've had several medical issues that I've gone to doctors for over and over and I just don't get any real concern or any improvement. No persol care, so I just don't have a high level of trust."
-1	With the on going battle over the cost of health care, doctors are more frequently making decisions that benefit them rather than the patient now a days.
-1	THEY ARE OK SO FAR MY CHECKS HAVE BEEN GREAT. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS OF MY SERVICES FOR NOW. I HAVE NO RESERVATION
-1	I've been seeing him for several years now, and have always followed his recommendations, which have been very useful. I expect this relationship to continue going forward. 
1	I believe that the Veterans Hospital has the best Doctors and Nurses and they have been treating me very well for over 30 years
-1	I trust my primary care physician to try to do what is best for me. However I realize he may be constrained by insurance restrictions or influence by drug manufactures.
-1	I would like my doctor to give me more attention when it comes to my concerns about my health. I would like him to explain things to me better so I can get a better understanding of my health,
-1	I just started with a new PCP and have only seen him once, but I didn't like him and probably won't go back. He was dismissive of all of my health concerns. I've been taking blood pressure meds for years and going off of one blood pressure reading he declared that I didn't need them anymore. I was complaining of aneurysm-like pain in an extremely small spot of my head and he ignored that completely.
1	I have always been completely satisfied with my Doctor. Always thorough gives me the goods and the bads and tells me it straight forward not holding back 
-1	Just a level a trust is built up when you see the same doctor for many years and he has always solved problems presented to him. My doctor has been the same my entire life. He even saw my parents when they were younger. I'm fortunate to never have experienced serious medical problems but if I did then I would trust him as getting me on the right track to getting better.
-1	i don't trust a doctor that won't directly answer my questions.  i don't trust a doctor that wants my money more than he wants to help me.
1	I trust doctors because i believe that they have my best interests at heart
-1	My last primary care was a DO not an MD, and would not treat menopause as a medical condition.  I had to request a referral to an OB/GYN to treat my menopause symptoms.
-1	I have been going to this same doctor for quite a few years and have always received good care and his manner is thoughtful pleasant and unhurried
-1	Looking for another doctor in the city
-1	doctors and staff are motivated by pharma, insurance, and liability.  They are also overworked, often seeing several patients at once.  That puts my best interests at the bottom of the barrel.  I have had bad luck with doctors through most of my life-- bad advice, dismissive of my symptoms, etc.  I don't dislike my current doctor, but don't fully trust her either.  
-1	My primary care physician is a great doctor. He seems to genuinely care about my medical situations and does his best to solve them.
-1	I havw a new pcp because my old pcp misdiagnosed me. She did this with a couple different things. One being hep b and hep a. I do not have and she said i did. New pcp is more of a doctor feel good, meaning he prescribes anything you ask for. I feel like he just goes through ths motions. I dont trust him completely.
-1	I have only seen my current physicians once or twice.  All of my long time physicians have retired from practice and I now have no physician that I've known, or been treated by, for a length of time.  
-1	Doctors make extra money by referring to other doctors and by prescribing certain medicines. That is counter to my best interests. I take what the doctor recommends with a grain of salt.
-1	I trust my doctor to always be truthful with me and I always tell him what he needs to know. I've been going to my doctor for years and I trust him
-1	I trust my dr. But I just feel that sometimes you need a second opinion which i find nothing wrong with that.
-1	I have more trust in doctors than I distrust them but there are always exceptions. Mostly it comes down to the situation because there are times when I can tell that they are hard pressed for time due to having a lot of patients. If it is a serious medical issue I would also want a second or third opinion regardless of the trust I have in my doctor.
1	I love my primary physician.  I do not go that often to the doctor but when i go with my husband he sits down with both of us and explains what is going on and then he explains how he is going to be treating the problem.  I do not think I could ever ask for a better doctor.
-1	I distrust my doctor because I go to the VA for my healthcare and they really don't seem to hire or keep the best of medical providers there. They are always in a rush and don't seem to really care to give the time of day to your problems they are all very low quality providers. So, that is why I do not trust my physician. 
1	I trust my medical doctor because she is a person that has been there for me throughout my entire life and has always done everything that she can to make sure that I feel comfortable and get well as soon as possible. I know that I can ask my doctor questions about anything and everything and that she'll try her best to answer whatever it is that I want to know without any kind of hesitation. My doctor is someone that I feel will always have my best interests in mind.
-1	I trust my primary care physician to run the things that he wants to. If I try to bring up something new he seems to want to hear it or care about it, but he is really good with the things he does do
-1	My physician does not hesitate to tell me if there is something I should or should not be doing in regards to my health. She is frank and open with me, and displays concern when evaluating the issues I have. She often seems rushed, however, so I occasionally have doubts about how thorough she it.
-1	He's nice and doesn't belittle my complaints.
1	In a couple of different appointments, I've asked about certain treatments or options for ailments and my doctor is very forthcoming.  Normally if he thinks it's overpriced hogwash, he'll give me his honest opinion.  He's also happily given me referrals to doctor's offices and recommendations to quality referrals for things that are recommended like an annual skin screening to proactively prevent skin cancer.  I think sometimes doctor's can be a little pill happy to offer them unnecessarily, but mine is usually more calculated and cares about finding a solution. In addition, his thoroughness actually saved a friend's life of mine when she had been complaining and struggling through a health problem with her other doctor, he uncovered a serious situation and got her the care she needed.
1	I have never had any reason to mistrust my primary care physician or any other healthcare provider that I have ever used in my life.
1	I generally trust them when there is no incentive to skew the truth. Even in that case they aren't lying they just aren't giving the best solution. 
-1	I typically trust my primary care physician unless they are inattentive or give me a reason not to trust them. If they lose my trust then I just find a new doctor and I do not give them the chance to betray me a second time. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have only had good experiences with them and they always seem to have my best interest in mind. The times that I have had to be given medicine they seem to do a great job of telling me all of the options possible to me and talk with me about the pros and cons of each one. They also seem to be aware of small details that show they have an interest in me. 
1	They seem trustworthy.  It is the insurance company I do not trust.
1	She takes the time to listen to my concerns and ideas and plan for my health, as well as providing valuable information to assist me in doing so.
-1	I have general trust as he has been working for many years and has usually fixed my ailments. However, I do feel that he is getting lazier as he nears retirement and sometimes wonder if he suggests medications due to relationships he has with pharmaceutical companies.
1	Doctors go through a lot of training and education to enter their careers, and there's a 100% chance that a doctor who is anywhere close to decent has more knowledge about health than I do.
1	My doctor is very verbal about what he thinks is happening. He explains the symptoms and what step should be taken to help cure the problem.
1	I trust my doctor because when he is with me he is force on me, he listen to what I am saying and take action about what I am saying. 
-1	I trust him because he listens to me and answers questions I have. he is polite and not pushy if I don't want a certain shot
-1	I trust most doctors. My office is full of residents, with full fledged doctors overseeing them.  They are usually thorough, however, a few have been known to rush me & do what they want & not listen to me.
1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him.  He has also gone above and beyond in taking care of the rest of my family, including handling a couple of emergency situations wonderfully.
-1	i trust medical professionals in general because i understand the job and pressures associated with the profession.
-1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind. At the end of the day he will do whats best for me even if it causes him an inconvenience 
1	I for the most part trust my primary care physician. They always seem to give me the best information and always give me the correct treatment for my illnesses. 
-1	I don't trust no doctor at all. Some diagnosis you wrong. Some don't even no whats wrong with you. They just try to solve your problem 
1	I trust them because I know they have to much to loose, additional to the fact that they're licensed 
-1	my doctor listens to me and consults me if anything is wrong. My doctor cares about me and has my best interest at heart.
-1	I don't know my doctor very well because I don't see him that often. Only 2 experience with him. I have a genera mistrust of anyone I don't know.
-1	My primary care physician is a local p/a but is not afraid to refer me to specialists in larger cities as necessary
-1	My doctor does not seem to give as much effort into examination of me.  They mainly just ask a few questions and then take a quick look.  I feel that therapists would be much more helpful.
1	I just made a appointment with my primary I had never seen him or any primary but I thought of my gynecologist who I've seen for years. I trust her because she has kept me healthy and is very polite. She is easy to talk to.
1	Because she is up front and honest and she is not going to beat around the bush about my health she tells it like it is rather i won't to hear it or not 
-1	"I definitely trust doctors, but ""completely"" is an awfully strong word. Doctors have hundreds of different patients, so don't always have the time to get to know me and my conditions as well as is necessary. While I trust their medical knowledge generally, I am ultimately in charge of my own health. "
1	my doctor has always been very friendly and helpful with anything regarding my health. he is always so understanding and nice that i always feel comfortable and well informed.
1	HE is very detailed and asks lots of questions and takes his time to answer each question and provide concise answers
-1	I like this doctor because be listens To my concerns. But he doesn't over prescribe medicine for my condition
-1	The doctor that I'm referring to is in OB-GYN and he has helped me deliver my youngest son who just turned one and I see him often for diabetes and other diabetes-related issues
-1	I know they are in the positions that they hold because of extensive education, experience and trust building with patients. They are able to answer all of my questions in a credible and convincing manner. I have had no breaches of trust to make me react otherwise.
-1	I trust my priamary care because I have seen her for many years and has always taken good care of me
1	primary care physician is one of the best things that we can do to ensure better care for ourself. This is because we are likely to become more trusting of our doctor as we see one another over the years, so this can lead to better communication, consistent treatment compliance, and regular appointments. For these reasons, it is important to take the time to find a clinic and primary care physician that we trust.
1	When i go to the doctor they listen to everything I have to say.  They answer all my questions.  They will also ask any follow up questions that they need answers too.  They don't rush through the appointment.  they take all the time that is needed by me and by them to come up with a solution to whatever the problem is.
-1	they know better than me about stuff, because i'm still a student...so. and i'm not studying their field, either...
-1	I barely trust mainstream doctors at all. A lot of their diagnoses are just guesses, but they act as if they KNOW what they're talking about and the patient doesn't. I use doctors mainly when I want a particular test done or think I need a prescription.
-1	My doctor is very nice, she tends to be very caring straightforward, she never holds back information from me. She tends to be worried when I tell her something is wron
-1	I trust my doctor because he gives me good advise and when I am having an issue , he is always helpful . He explains to me what to do and what are my best options to feeling better. 
1	I feel my doctors have always been honest with me. They have always all options for a treatment and the informaion foe me to make a good decision
-1	I neither fully trust nor fully distrust doctors and other medical professional. I know that there are some good ones out there but I also know not all of them have the patients best interest in mind.
1	I like to think they do the job in order to help me feel better. Admittedly, I have felt a little rushed in a busy office, but I have never felt like they were deliberately being careless. I think they have my best interests in mind, even though I have had some unsuccessful treatments. I think this is a problem of specialization, as some GP's do not have the in depth knowledge to treat specific medical issues. I trust my GP with my overall health in the end.
-1	I believe doctors often do not want to admit when they do not know something so they will bs and beat around the bush. This leads me to not trust them and be skeptical of future advice.
1	Even doctors nowadays doubt the efficiency of healthcare system advising patients not to trust physicians âany more than you trust your stockbroker (if you are ... Maybe this is the reason why many doctors are complaining on their patient's behavior accusing them of being âdifficult, nasty, obnoxious .
-1	he is older and not up to date on a lot of the newer advances in medicine and I feel he prescribes stuff to get the perks
-1	in 1998 a Dr said I had breast cancer.  He cut my breast off and took out 11 lymphnodes   He got the records mixed up and gave me surgery for someone with stage 4 cancer.  I now have immune system problems and lymphodemia.  He gave me 5 years to live.  Before this the Dr was always right.  I approach Dr's like I do Medicine, with caution.  Only if I really, really need it.  
-1	I don't have a primary Doctor. After recent experience with my Mom being hospitalized for and extended period of time, and fighting hard for her life, the doctors kept misdiagnosing her until it was too late. She passed away because of this, so I don't have much trust in doctors right now.
-1	There are good people and try to do the best they can to assist you and others with there needs and make sure you are happy with the outcome
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for a while and she has always taken good care of me and always been honest and upfront with me about things.
-1	I've never been given a reason not to trust my PCP - Dentists on the other hand: don't trust them!
-1	My current physician has taken me very seriously and been open about all the options, however, past physicians have not at all
-1	I can't really say weather or not I trust my doctor because its usually always different. That's what I think I usually want a 1st 2nd and sometimes 3rd opinion 
-1	Doctors seem very disinterested and distant. They don't seem to fully take my complaints into account and they always seem in a rush to get me out as fast as possible. I hate being treated that way. 
-1	She's always  been excellent in treating me and is a good listener Always helps me whenever I need treatment quickly 
-1	I don't care for my primary car physician. I feel like I am just a number as she quickly would complete my visit and rarely answer questions. When I truly had a need she didn't have any advice for me and didn't offer to converse with her colleagues to find out.She also didn't listen to me and caused me several scares during my first pregncy. I haven't seen my PCP in 6 years because of it. 
-1	I believe the medical industry is plagued with physicians and companies who desire money more than they desire healthy patients. 
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician she is very thorough and explains everything to me so I understand it
-1	I trust the physicians because it's their job to do right and help me out and then I distrust them because they will overcharge for bills.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing my doctor since I was 3 and he has never disappointed me 
-1	Everyone is different. Some are better than others.
1	I think they have the knowledge to know what is wrong and it seems reasoble about what they are telling me. I see no reason to distrust them until they prove me wrong.
-1	Doctors now days are taught to get a patient in and out.  Very few take the time to really hear what you are saying and even fewer spend the time that is needed to find out what the root problem is.  They usually give you some med and it is just a band-aid and you will have to come back at a later time.  Some older physicians still take time but most of the young ones do not.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physicians for over 5 years now.  He has never failed me in letting me know what my problems are.  I completely trust him when it comes to my health.
-1	do not really have a primary care doctor, but if i had one I would probably trust him or her with my medical care.  sometimes I fell that it is hard for me to speak up sometims/
1	I trust my doctor because he has a lot of experience in what he does. He listens to what you have to say and then from a medical stand point he lets you know what he feels is appropriate.
1	I normally trust my doctor but I do have ideas of my own for treatment when I think I can use something more tural vs pharmaceutical. 
-1	My Doctor is very young and seems to always be in a massive hurry. I just don't feel like he has enough life experience yet to really be able to diagnose to his full potential.
-1	"In the current times it seems doctors easily push the strongest drugs on a patient. By saying this I don't mean to suggest any link to the opioid crisis in the country. For instance, my last emergency care visit was last year when I had a kidney stone. This wasn't the first time I've ever had one (2nd time in the emergency room for it in 10 years), and they gave me extremely harsh prescriptions. One of the medications prescribed was Ciprofloxacin instead of pencillin to fight bacteria (I apparently had a UTI). After only taking ""Cipro"" a total of 3 times, it gave me deep pain in my joints that lasted for over 6 months. I could hardly walk and I definitely couldn't bend my knees. I think doctors  jump the gun with a lot of medications instead of starting ""small"" to see what works. I tend to believe doctors now are really careless with all the serious side effects because they spend so little time with patients."
-1	I fee Like sometimes doctors are to quick to prescribe medications without having to Dig hard to know exactly what's the real issue.
1	I put my trust in my doctor because I think they know what's best for me and I 100% trust their decisions 
-1	Regarding doctors in general, I have trust in them because I have no other choice. I have to trust that my doctor has my interest in mind. However, I am also aware that many doctors are often sponsored my drug companies, or they could just be wrong about certain medical opinions. Therefore, it is necessary to get a second opinion. 
-1	I distrust my doctor because I feel that I'm just a check to them. I sometimes leave feeling that nothing had been accomplished by my visit and that my suggested treatment was the most convenient for them. I've also been misdiagnosed at least once to my knowledge.
1	MY primary care physician is always thorough with me and gives me good advice in regards to my treatment. I have always gotten better by doing what he says so I have a lot of faith in his judgements
1	My doctors take time to talk to me.  They ask me if I have any questions and then they take time in answering my questions.
1	I do trust my primary care physician. He has helped me through some trying times and has given me more time,during visits, than I expected and more than I have been given in the past by other physicians.
1	All of the doctors I've ever met have been extremely calm and thorough with everything. They always go through procedures and explain exactly what they think and what I should do and why I should do it. I trust them very much and have no reason not to. 
1	I have total trust in my physician,  If I didn't, I would find another one in which I did trust.  I have never felt misled or lied to,  I feel as though they are looking out for my health, and helping me stay healthy. 
-1	There is two things that I think that you need to fine find that what's love and what's things thing are going we need to help 
1	I think he is mostly trustworthy and competent.
1	I went to several Doctors to find the one that I have now.  My doctor will stay in the room with you until they have answered all questions.  My doctor does not let anything else distract him while you are being examined.  The doctor will ask several times if you understand or if you need them to go over anything else again.
-1	I trust her to make the right decisions but feel extremely rushed when seeing her with any concerns or worries
-1	Not all doctors Are authentic in their reasons for going into a helping profession and are money focused 
-1	I believe people--including medical professionals--operate from their own built-in biases and those biases can result in a doctor's not offering up ALL options, choices and decisions that are out there for consideration. For example, if a doctor believes in saving lives at all costs, he's not likely to suggest hospice care to a patient who has entered or is close to entering the terminal phase of life.
-1	I like to get a second, third, and sometimes fourth opinion on things. My primary care doctor isn't God and I don't entrust my health to her. Her services are valuable, however.
-1	I think that they will try to keep me sick so that they can make money off of me for as long as they can.
-1	I trust doctors but still not feel the need to run to them with every little problem see if I can do it at home I feel no need to go to the doctor
1	I have been lucky in life.  I have not ever had any serious medical issues.  So maybe my faith in medicine hasn't really been tested yet.  But I tend to trust my doctor to give me the best care that she knows how.  I know that science and medicine are always coming up with new ideas, so not everyone can know everything.  all I as is the best care you know to provide. 
1	My primary care physician has only ever shown me they are thorough.  They do not make me feel rushed and always provide a satisfactory answer and checkup before they move on.
1	I never trust anyone completely, however I truly believe that most doctors are truthful and honest or the most part when talking to the clients
-1	Because they have a knowledge of natural, alternative medicine. They look at the whole person not just the symptoms. 
1	I have a new primary care physician who is very cordial, friendly, smiley, smart, and caring. He looks at you and listens carefully to what you say and responds very politely and respectfully. He explains things nicely and with details and examples. He takes his time with you and makes sure he's answered all of your questions before the session is over. He doesn't order unnecessary tests or medications. He is great!
-1	"I think the vast majority of doctors become insensitive to their patients and their problems.  In fact, I think they lose the ability to even recognize that their patients are people.  They seem to push whatever ""treatments"" benefit themselves the most financially, without any regard to how that's going to affect their patients financially or otherwise.  "
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my physician for ten years and I will not have it any way.  He make sure I am good and whatever I problem I have he addresses the problem with the upmost reapect
-1	It seems to me that most if not all doters are working for pharmsudical companies to try new drugs on unsuspecting patients,which seldom works on individual people rather than the majority

1	I have never had any issues with my doc. They are always straight forward and are very helpful when I need it.
1	My Dr is fairly new to me so i am learning to trust her in all matters.  So far she has been on target
1	We have had a long term relationship, he listens to me and responds appropriately. He makes sure I get the answers I need
-1	I believe that some doctors pay attention to you, but some do not. My current doctor i don't believe listens to me. When i first was going through menopause i felt like i was going crazy to have some much anxiety. He was a young doctor and i felt like he was looking at me like i just wanted drugs. He never explained to me all that goes along with menopause.
-1	 As a poor citizen of the United States I like millions of my fellow countryman probably avoid seeing doctors as much as possible. The cost of health care is insane and the treatment that is given to lower class individuals is often not very good. I can say this from first hand experience as told in my previous statement. Doctors often seem to care more about money than about the ethical side of their profession which is to help people. I feel there is a large disconnect between healthcare needs and healthcare providers in this country. Doctors taking hand outs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe their drugs is a huge conflict of interests. Healthcare should not be a for profit business but rather a human right. Until this concept is realized in this country and in the rest of the world who is falling behind the general public will continue to not trust doctors and not seek medical help. Going into crippling debt for simply seeing a doctor is not an option for most people.
1	I am typically a type of person who does not like medication being the first option for everything. My doctor understands that and will give me other options that don't include medication.
1	They are always very thorough in explaining what the possibilities are for treatment. They are always so careful in explaining the pros and cons of each treatment in a way that I can weigh them more easily.
1	My doctor is the first one to listen to me when I told him my antidepressants were making my feet and legs stay swollen and also it was causing me to shake a lot when I got hungry.  He took me off the immediately and then gave me the option of trying to survive without them or going on another type.  We worked together to get me off of both of them.  He also listened to my issue about sleep apnea and got me tested and approved for a corrective surgery.
-1	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable in the heath field than I am and I have to trust because there is no other option.
1	I have a regular physician at the university hospital. I have been seeing him for past few years. So far, I do not have any issues with. During my visit, he is always very professional. He seems to care a lot about patients. He is always polite, kind and caring. He seems very focused during the diagnosis. After careful examination, he has been able to explain my problems in simple words and recommend the proper treatment. He always warns about possible side effects of any prescription.  So, far I have not had any issues with treatment and medicines. That is why I trust my physician very much. 
-1	The last time at the physician's office my doctor gave me the same medicine that I was given at the hospital.  I went in for knee pain and unable to walk. I had the results sent to my doctor's office, but she didn't even remember looking at them. She didn't send me to get x-rays, MRI, or anything else.  Still having knee pain and very hard to walk.
-1	I am a skeptical person about everything really. I know it's not called for a lot of the time but I just can't help it. I often question whether or not the doctor has my best interest at heart. 
1	I have been with her for years and have never know her to put me off or not listen. She listens to what I have to say and goes with me. Her medications are spot on and she has checked my record before we have an appointment so we do have to play 20 questions.
1	I trust both of my doctors, MD and psych. They have a great track record with me and my treatments. I don't know what else to say.
-1	I HAVE NO REASON TO TRUST MY DOCTOR. HE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN HIS BOTTOM LINE. I NEED TO CHANGE DOCTORS
-1	I trust my doctor, because I expect that he has my best health interest at heart. Sometimes, this may not be true which makes it difficult for patients when someone they expect to help them is rather callous to their call for aid. 
-1	He has actually listened and seem more concerned than most doctors I have had in the past. I trust him, to an extent, because he seems to listen and try to figure out the best action to take, but since I have had testing on things that were expensive and still had no resolution and he seems to not have as much experience as others, I do not completely trust him.
1	My primary care Dr. always takes time to LISTEN to me, and explains any medical issues to me in  terms that I understand.
1	I trust my physician completely. I have been sing the same doctor for many years. He knows were I stand with taking non nonessential medications, and antibiotics. I believe he respects that. He has never steered me wrong before. I have also never had any health issues other than an occasional cold. I also believe that a good education in the medical field is also a must have. My doctor has taken many courses and is very well rounded. He has a great amount of experience.  
-1	I trust in doctors in general because they studied during many years their carears and they are well prepared .
1	I trust mines because I have not experience anything that went wrong as of yet.
-1	I am just a person the Doctor puts my name in the computer.  What happened to the good ole days when the Dr. Looks at me instead of the screen.
1	I have had the same Dr. for a lot of years .He is alwys nice ,explains everything in detail for me .He is very kind and thoughtful.
-1	Conveyor belt care, prescribes drugs my insurance won't cover, just does the very least.
-1	It is someone that I have been seeing for quite some time.  If he does something wrong I think its just from lack of knowledge.  There isn't a lot of time to be spent with each patient.  
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I am best friends with them and if they lie to me they will get in trouble.
1	he is willing to work with me and try other ways instead of adding more medicine that would be more harmful then helpful
-1	I prefer to have second opinions on my health to ensure that I know all of the information and not make any hasty decisions.
1	I trust my primary care physician, in part because my father, who was also a physician had recommended him. All my interactions with him are positive and he has genuine concern and interest in my health.
-1	Because A lot of Doctors have been known to false diagnose a person Blacks are high in that trick.  Example tell someone black they have a lump then who are they to know the future. They say you need to take Chemo therapy we THINK!!! its Cancer. Lies. Then 2 months later they Die. Secretly murdered by a Doctor
-1	I often feel like my doctor is so busy that I am just another body walking through a room to hurry on their way. I often feel like my problems aren't big enough or interesting enough to warrant being given full attention.
-1	I don't really feel either, i don't know them enough but they do help if i need it.  they can guide me but don't just give me all the answers, and they have ok ratings.
1	I have to trust him I guess, he has a license so that good enough for me, he malpractices that's on him
1	I trust my doctor. I can talk to her about any and everything. My doctor always takes as much time as needed with her clients.
1	i trust doctors because they aren't evil people. they spend years going to school to help people, not to lie to them. I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies though.
-1	"I have a lot of medical conditions that I've had most of my life, but I have overlooked because my parents told me they were normal. They were not. Now that I'm talking to my doctor about them I feel as though he thinks I'm a hypochondriac and doesn't take me seriously. I've had chronic soreness my entire life. He doesn't believe me. There are a few conditions that are more ""modern"" that he just doesn't believe in. "
1	He is very thorough in running tests to make sure I am healthy.  I feel confident in his ability to answer any questions I have.  He takes the time to sit and talk directly with me about any concerns that I have.  He is very patient and I feel concerned about my well being.
-1	I trust my doctor but if I had a serious illness I would see a specialist and if I was given a new medication I would investigate it before taking it.
-1	I do not always completely trust doctors. On simple diagnoses yes, I do trust them but as far as more complex health issues I would rather get a second opinion as well just to be certain that the diagnosis is correct. 
-1	I guess I would say I trust him. I feel I dont have any other choice. I dont think my dr would want to misinform me
-1	I go to a primary care physician at a school health center and I think that he is on a tight schedule, and has a lot of patients each day that limits his time to spend diagnosing my problems. 
-1	I would suspect that a doctor that is engaging in activities that would lead to people questioning their legitimacy in their decisions wouldn't still be able to be a physician. All my physicians that I've ever had seemed to genuinely care about wanting to treat patients to the best of their abilities.
-1	People can have favorites, flavors, ideas and treatments. So someone can easily get into the routine of recommending a favorite treatments. Also, people can be out of date in their ideas. 
-1	They do not listen to me and I feel that they really do not care to try to understand what I am trying to tell them.  It makes me feel like I am not making sense of what is happening to me. 
-1	i don't know them well and they're a conventiol doctor who wants to deal with symptoms rather than root causes, which isn't something i agree with. i do my own research and speak with a relative who is a doctor as well.
-1	I think doctors at times will push what is easiest for them or what they think might be a option that is a little more costly when the risk is not too high. I feel like anything else doctors are out to make money. They may ask you to do unneccesary tests as well at times.
1	I know my doctor well, and have considerable experience with him and his methods.I trust him to keep me informed about my health issues.
1	My group of doctors work together to get me the care needed. They toss ideas around with each other so there is always a second and third opinion before we move forward with anything in the event that I do get sick.
1	Relates well personally and spends time talking and suggesting best care.  History of experience in their medical speciality.
1	My doctor is fairly new to me.  I have only seen her a couple of times.  So far, I feel that she is trustworthy and has explained why the need for certain tests and paths of treatment.  She is educated, warm and very friendly
-1	It's hard to keep cynical thoughts out of my mind. I can't help but see them as flawed and just figuring things out like everyone else. It's hard to know if I'm communicating clearly enough for them to totally understand everything anyway.
-1	I like and trust my doctor, I've been a patient of his for several years. I trust his judgement and diagnosis although I also know sometimes doctors are just guessing. 
1	I very much trust my primary care physician. She is quite young but doesn't hesitate to scold or call me out when she's not happy with me. I don't like doctors or the whole medical process and she knows what buttons to push. She answers my questions patiently and explains her thought processes behind all her decisions. She very much talks to me and never through me and that's a huge plus. 
-1	I just started with a new doctor and I like her a good bit. However, this has not been the case in general with doctors giving me medications without telling me what exactly they're meant to solve, what interactions I should be aware of, or what side effects to expect. I end up doing a tremendous amount of googling to make sure I'm not missing something. 
1	I trust my doctor because he check on medicines that are best for me. He listens and provide the prescription that are best for me. 
1	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear versus what I may want to hear. Hearing those true facts allow me to make sure I am aware of the decisions that I choose to make. I believe it is important to gain the trust in the doctor, so they know what your background story may be. Most times it is best if they share their own story to make myself or the patient feel more comfortable. this allows me to open up more to them and tell them whats writing frequently. 
1	I have had the same physician for more than ten years.  He knows me personally and is very aware of my medical and a lot of my personal history. He has never steered me wrong in medical treatments or information.
1	I trust my primary physician because I've known him for many years. It is more of a built up trust that we have.
1	though I've only been seeing this dr for a short time, she is thorough and compassionate takes her time with me at my appointments
-1	they are usually honest up front about what is going on with me. ask if I have any questions on anything. a few times the doctor did not read when I listed I can't do clartin allergy pills or nasal spray
1	My doctor is fairly conservative in treating most issues initially. On the other hand, he is proactive and quick to address problems needing immediate attention and action. He also believes in natural solutions over pharmaceuticals whenever possible.
-1	I distrust my primary physician because when it comes to giving out medicine these doctors don't know exactly what is in it. So I feel like I should research the stuff my doctor said when I get home and then make a decision myself and talk to my doctor about it.
-1	I do not have 100% trust in my doctor because she just sends my blood work in the mail & never explain how I can do better I have to figure it out on my own & when she give me prescriptions she never check my paper work to even see if it has something in it that I will have allergic reaction to it or not.
1	i trust him but im smart enough to research things outside of the office to make sure he is correct in what hes telling
1	Before I choose a physician or hospital that I would go to ER visit I always check the reviews and I always do my research and up to now I've had great confidence with all the positions are hospitals that I have chosen
1	Overall, I trust in my doctor because of her confidence and demeanor. She has always been extremely kind, full of information, and has let me know of alternatives if there are any. A primary example was when she prescribed me anti depression medication last year. They worked well, and she made me feel confident that they would help with my situation. 
1	I have worked hard to find a physician who will listen to and believe me when I talk about my health.  My doctor not only listens but acts on what I am telling her.  I trust her because we work as a team when it comes to my health concerns.
-1	I trust my doctors but you always need to have common sense when it is about your heath. I just don't take what they say ad not do any research on my own.
1	I feel that doctors are for the most part trustworthy. But in general some are in a big hurry to get to the next patient. They sometimes make it seem like  are putting them out to ask many questions. Like you are wasting their time.
1	Don't go to primary care Dr. often, but have been very satisfied in how she listens and checks things.
-1	I have issues with doctors telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They think that they are more than God. 
1	She has been pretty accurate and her assessments of my health.  She gives me advice that is reasonable and feasible.
-1	As with most things/people, a medical professiol can have an agenda they are pushing and most of the time it's for monetary reasons. I don't believe in taking unneccessary medicine and sometimes I don't trust the dr when they tell me I need to take a medicine when I think there is a better treatment option available.
-1	I have always had good interaction with my primary care physician and feel like i can trust them with all of medical needs.  This person does not judge me and gives advice for all things that i come to them with.  I have never had a reason not to trust this person. 
1	My primary care physician has never given me reason to distrust him and therefore I trust him very much. He has always given me all the options that I have for whatever medical conditions I am facing. 
1	I trust my doctor, although we have disagreed on the best treatment options in the past. I do not always think that a pill is the cure, while he tends to prescribe medications for everything. I do think he looks out for me though and has my interests in mind.
-1	He seems to know what he is talking about when it comes to my health. He does take the time to ask questions and does a thorough checkup. What I find that frustrates me is he never calls back and it is hard to get an appointment.
1	He has helped me in the past in dealing with health issues and he acts more like a friend in our appointments rather than someone just trying to force something and being very indifferent when it comes to our conversations. He actually speaks and you can feel his concern and his understanding. He knows how to be a friend or at least act friendly.
1	Because my doctor is a very professional and well prepared person who knows the area in which I am currently treated.
-1	The reason that I trust my primary care doctor is the he tells specifically what I need to do to take care of my health
-1	He doesn't really listen to my concerns or questions, only wants to blow it off like it is nothing. i have to repeat my self a lot
-1	My doctors will take the time to research a problem if they're not familiar with it.  They always make sure that I have all the information needed to make an informed decision about any medical conditions that come up. I go to a doctor's office that has multiple doctors in it and don't always see the same one, so it's important to me that they look over my records and are basically on the same page as far as any care is concerned.  We live in a rural area and the doctors communicate with each other in a thorough manner.  When you are referred to a specialist they always get complete information on your condition which saves time for all parties involved.  
-1	I generally trust them becuase of all the schooling they had plus i can easily verify if they are lying by doing a quick search online in about 5 minutes
-1	Sometimes doctors rush on surguries and sometimes even kill people. You have toprove to me that you are worthy enough to be my doctor.
-1	I have been misdiagnosed with mental illnesses twice. He is quick to prescribe medication and get me out of the office and on my way. One of the medications I took had negative side effects and he was unconcerned. It seemed he just recommended it for the commission cash. That medication has since been recalled. Both the doctor and his medical assistant rush through questions during check-ups. I feel like I'm inconveniencing everyone by being there.
-1	it is neutural, because sometimes where I am from they just want a quick fix  and try to just take care of the issue as quick as they can
1	I trust her implicitly. She is thorough, asks questions, actually listens to my answers and answers my questions. She is friendly,  seems really interested in me.
1	My doctor takes the time to listen intently to my concerns and isn't afraid to say that she needs to do more research. She's very detailed and knows a lots about medical researches 
1	I was going to the same primary care physician since i was very young. My mother personally knows my doctor so i feel very comfortable taking advice from that person. I think this person has good intentions and really wants to help me 
-1	My primary doctor is a smart, honest and caring person , I trust him taking care of me in my time of need, he explains everything in detail and breaks it down so you can understand what you need to know and then he asks if you have any questions and if you do he will kindly answer them and tell you what you need to know 
-1	In my case I have always looked for doctors who earn my trust. Currently my doctor is trusted because he has a lot of academic experience and also has a very good experience practicing what he already knows. During the consultations shows that he knows what he is doing, and that gives me confidence, something that is very important to deposit in a doctor
-1	With all the schooling and expenses doctors have to pay in medical school I would hope they enjoy what they are doing. I trust my doctor because that is their profession and I feel comfortable with their decisions 
-1	Cause he  try to get me out of the office fast and always say exercise to every problem I have and that's not what's going to solve my issues 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor because of how he has treated me in the past with being ill also I've known the doctor for years 
-1	I think I can trust any medical guys that I come in counter with, I haven't met any quacks yet In my life time.
1	My doctor is compassionate and open. She is willing to take the time to answer any questions I have. She is reassuring too.
-1	Since I feel good and get cured after a doctors visit i feel like the doctor is helping me to stay healthy.
-1	this is one of the most amazing men that I have met in my life.  My doctor is an amazing person who always helps me in times of need and I also feel like he always has the answers to all of my medical problems in any time i need them
-1	I have had many doctors over the years and sometimes they have totally lied to me and cost me my health.
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part because they are more knowledgeable about the medical field than I am. I don't trust 100% because although medicine has been researched and studied, there are always thin g that may be unknown.
-1	My doctor is usually very thorough. He listens intently to everything that I try to communicate to him.He shows genuine concerne for my well being.
-1	Been going to him for many years and have great confidence in him and the information he give me.   have a trusting relationship with him.
1	Our PC is extraordinarily thorough. If I cad to criticize anything, it would be that all of his concerns share the same high priority.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has a lot of experience in the medical field.  He serves as a mentor and teacher in the medical community and seems to be an expert in his field.  
1	My doctor has always had my trust and has not failed me yet. So I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	I distrust doctors a bit in general because I've had bad experiences in the past with doctors leading me down the wrong path. At the end of the day they are still just human and I believe it should be a team process in finding the best treatment for you since you are the one that has to live with the consequences. 
-1	because he is our family doctor... i know him from a very long time... i know his capacity as a doctor... he is very kind and highly knowledgeable... so i completely trust him...
-1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has extensive experience in her field. She is backed by a degree specializing in her area and she's had no complaints from me or any other patients. She makes me feel comfortable.
1	my doctor is up on everything as he goes to conference. He also knows pharmacolical answersMy daughter who is the hospital CFO recommended him.
1	I think sometimes Physicians are in a hurry. So it is to their advantage to gloss over your case. So instead of carefully considering your case they just take care of the obvious and move on to the next patient.
1	I trust my primary care physician because so far he has been of a great help to me. Everything that he has told me so far to improved my health has been working. I agree and trust his work of expertise.
1	"My Dr. is very attentive and willing to talk to you if you have questions. he never pushes any ""drugs"" and always seems to be willing to help you not come bck to his ofice. He is personalble and isdedicated to huis patients. He once saw me without an appointment (ona busy day) because I had no other day in which I could return. "
-1	It's rare I visit with a doctor that seems genuinely concerned or one that assumes his first diagnosis isn't correct. All seem to be THE expert. Some seem tired of the repetitiveness of their practice. And most seem to prescribe a specific, expensive drug, when there are other options available.
1	I trust doctors because they have the most knowledge on what is best for my condition. There is so much conflicting information that a healthcare professional is the only source of an effective care solution. If I want to recover as quickly as possible then following doctors orders is the best method.
1	I have always had a good long term relationship with my PCP. I see him several times a year even when I feel fine. Health checkups, flu shots a vaccinations ...we are always on good terms. If there's a problem, he won't sugar coat it..he'll be direct and honest...I like that.
-1	I have had great doctors and I have had bad doctors. It takes research and checking them out before you trust a doctor.
-1	I think doctors get rushed by office managers. I also think insurance reimbursements to doctors are diminishing so the doctors are having to see more people in the same amount of time and this results in subpar focus and attention. I also think doctors get into a 'groove' and tend to prescribe the same things and give the same diagnoses without giving extra thought to if there is more going on than it seems at first. 
-1	I didn't in the beginning. He's kind of hard to get to know but, after three years he seems to have relaxed and has confidence that I am making an attempt to do what he says and take care of myself.
-1	The Primary Care physician I saw for 12 years moved too far away for me to see him regularly or when I'm sick.  I changed to someone in the same group but closer geographically. It's a totally bad fit!  He goes by the numbers and doesn't really listen to what's going on with me like symptoms, etc.  He refers me to specialists for health care problems he should be able to manage.  He is very quick to write prescriptions for problems that require more examination and assessment. The practice wants patients to use a patient portal to message doctors.  He answers my questions in very short, often, one word answers. I'm already shopping for a new primary care physician.   
1	I trust my doctor as I have been seeing her for many years now.
-1	I trust them because of their experiences and knowledge 
1	I have a tremendous primary care physician who actually takes great pains to make sure I receive excellent medical care. 
1	I trust my doctor. If there's ever a time that I don't, I don't have a problem getting a second opinion from another doctor. That doesn't mean that I don't trust him as a whole, just that in a certain situation, I would like to know that he is consistent with another doctor. I feel that I can trust my doctor because he seems invested in me. He know about me personally, and he shows true interest in my life.
1	I have known my primary care physician for a long long time now, and every time I get sick or I need help with a medical condition he is there for me, always knows what is going on and always helps me
1	my primary care physician is very direct and honest about all aspects of my health and well being. my primary care physician always takes the time to make sure that i know exactly what is going on and that i have all the information that i need, and that i know what all of my options are.
-1	I do not have a primary care dr. I just moved and havent found a new dr yet,will be finding one soon
-1	"I see my PCP once a month and in any given 12 month period he may take my BP or listen to my heart 1 or 2 times in those 12 months.  He does not generally ask how I am doing or feeling only comes in, sits down in front of the computer and asks ""what do you need today"" referring to Rx refills.  He is not a hands on doctor and If I should ask or complain about a problem he dismisses it and says we are all getting older."
-1	I trust my primary doctor because she has also been my parents' doctor for a long time, so I can trust her. 
-1	i think it is wonderful. i like to eat great thing and go on nice vacations. i better get my ring soon, how long does a girl like me have to wait. its crazy
-1	My primary care physician has never given me any reason to doubt her practices. She has always shown both compassion and knowledge. 
-1	I don't trust some doctors because they are on a higher pay grade and tend to have an eminence of superiority.  Don't get me wrong, some doctors are great, they seem to want to help.  To others I may feel like another cattle being strung along and they don't care if I end up in a dazzling meadow or at a slaughterhouse as long as they get their payment. In my situation (chronic rhinitis) I often have to asking prodding questions to really get any help on my issue.  Everything they have recommended hasn't helped at all, they say the cyst in my sinus doesn't matter, my jaw being realigned with palatal expander/braces doesn't matter, both these things seem like something worth investigating more, but they don't.  Sure I think they probably know better, but I don't count 100% on it.
1	In general, my primary care physician has been a very good fit for me.  He does work in a very busy practice, so I can imagine that he might overlook something in my care, but I have not seen him do so in my dealings with him.
1	I know him personally so I know he'd tell the truth
-1	At the time I wasn't going to my primary doctor but I was pregnant and I guess I was taking off my mom's insurance so I couldn't make an appointment until they fixed it. Well when I finally got back on it and had an apoointment, instead of checking on the baby we just did a pregnancy test and questionnaires.  Second appointment was once I started losing him. They did a ultrasound and said he was fine. Later that day I had a huge headache and threw up the next day I was fine. That following Thursday he came out too early. When I told them my water broke they didn't try to help me. I had to take a picture in order for moves to be made. The nurse wouldn't tell me a gender. They never asked if I wanted to hold him or bury him. He was still attached to his cord and the placenta was somewhat still inside. For about 4 hours my son sat in between my legs with the placenta still inside of me. Once they finally found that type of doctor she took the placenta out and basically dropped him on the floor. I feel more should've been done that first and second appointment and both trips to the er. Then the following month they thought I had a std. Everything came back negative but no further tests on me as to why i had all the symptoms and why my son came out so early.  I had about 4 (I forgot what it's called but you get it often when you're in your 30s) last summer. Soon in August or September I had a follow up and he was a boy and there wasn't anything wrong with him. I knew that when we saw him on the ultrasound. He was alive and active. 
1	I rarely go to the doctor because I am in excellent health. when I do have to go, I feel that the doctors that have been assigned to me always take good care of me and don't let me leave not knowing what is going on with my health or if there are any health concerns. this in turn gives me the optimistic and trustworthiness of my doctors that I can go into a health care facility and not have any regrets. I don't feel that the doctors at any time are looking more for convenience for them, than my actual health.
-1	I have been with the same doctor for 18 years.  I trust him to make the right decisions concerning my health. 
-1	They work for a business just like anyone else. You can't trust them more than you trust any salesman.
-1	"I distrust most of the medical community in general because they assume that they know more than their success rate would corroborate. Their procedures and treatments are more of an attack on the body, hence the 'negative side-effects"". They rely almost entirely upon laboratory ""medications"", while scoffing at most tural treatments. They're drug pimps for the pharmaceutical industry. Most pharmaceuticals are the result of back-engineering things found in ture that are free. However, you can't have a trillion dollar industry informing people that they can use tural altertives at a small fraction of the cost (if not freely) and that the altertives don't cause sty side-effects. The medical community is great for dealing with body parts, but they're failing miserably when it comes to actually curing diseases. They focus more on making the patient FEEL better while they still have the underlying condition."
-1	I feel that some doctors are more into trying to get you out of the office after running up your medical bills than they are into helping patients to get better. 
1	I trust my Doctor because I have been with them for a long time. They have always gave me accurate information and diagnosed problems with relative ease. I have never had an issue that resulted from any decision they have made regarding my plan of care.
-1	I don't like how Dr.s get kick backs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe meds. This makes me not trust them because they put themselves first.
1	My primary care physician is direct to the point, and makes sure you understand what is going on.
-1	I trust that my doctor is doing the best he can. I think he is rushed and overworked though and perhaps could just miss things in haste. 
1	They have never steered me wrong in talking with me about my care. Always talked to me about everything and answered all my questions thoroughly
-1	they seem kind of crooked
-1	I view them more of a guide than an expert on everything. For more common occurrences, I believe he has his way of doing things, which isn't necessarily the only way or even the best way. 
1	Since the first day in her office she and her team of nurses have strove to make sure I was okay and was always willing to answer any and all of my questions. I have always felt comfortable and well taken care of.
-1	i know how doctors get kick backs for prescribing certain medications and although I do like my doctor, I still don't trust that they always have my best interests in mind. 
-1	My doctor is persoble and down to earth and makes going to the doctor easy. She is also very up front about different options and treatments and doesn't give her own opinion of the product but what might work best for the individual.
-1	I trust my doctor in that he listens to my concerns and takes my suggestions into consideration. He is a newer doctor to me and knows I have been dealing with certain heath issues for a while.
-1	I am not sure about those decisions since I only go to my doctor for annual check these years
1	I fully trust my doctors, I rely on their input and knowledge to guide me in my medical care. My doctors and I have a relationship that is long term.
1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I do feel that the majority of doctors are going to try their best to do what is in the best interest of their patients. 
-1	Sometimes I feel like she is being judgy and isn't being thorough. Other times, she is kind and helpful.
1	i believe that health care is mainly a way of making money. Maybe there are some providers that are honest and caring but the majority are in it for the money
1	I trust my PCP because she thoroughly explains everything to me. She asks questions about how I'm feeling/my conditions, and makes sure that treatments and medications are working as they should be without any adverse effects.
1	Because my doctor has been my primary care for 15 years and we are good friends.besides i am in pretty good shape thanks to my doctor
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about my diet. He also encourages me to exercise regularly. He is less likely to prescribe me medicines that I don't need.
-1	I'm a person who needs a lot of information and completely capable of understanding complex medical research. If I think they are hedging or not giving me all the options, I'll find another doctor. If they explain and give me detailed information I trust them.
-1	A primary care physician is something like an immediate or emergency physician. It is to which we go first and these doctors see the seriousness of the health problem
1	I believe in the experience and education of the physician and I do believe the physician has my best interest at heart even though he or she may have the best bedside manner 
-1	I think that sometimes the doctor is not listening to my concerns and is just giving me text book or generic answers.
1	My doctor is very truthful to me and she always tells me exactly what I want to hear, which is the truth. She is very qualified and I consider her one of the best doctors in the area.
-1	I like my primary care physician but I must be cautious. Although my doctor cares for his patients' well-being, he does seem to push prescriptions rather than talking about potential altertives. I do not feel he is wrong in prescribing the medications for most of his patients but I have a strong desire to seek out altertive treatments.
-1	I believe all people only care about themselves and would take care of number 1 before anybody. In general people can not be trusted.
-1	I don't mistrust, it's just that she has a lot of patients. She does what she has to do for my care, but not above and beyond the call of duty in opinion.
1	I have been with the same physician for years and he has never let me down always prescribes the best for me and recommends further help if needed.
1	i trust my doctor totally.......when he prescribes a new med or feels i need test done.......i discuss with good friends and they all agree with his treatment.
-1	Its been quite a while since I seen my Dr. We moved and I havent found a personal dr. If we are in need of medical care we go to  instacare, I have found them to be knowledgeable and helpful, as if our family dr. Really good to explain.  I trust them both.
-1	I trust my doctors because they answer my questions when I ask them, they don't treat me like a child or an idiot, and they actually pay attention to what I am saying. My doctors are engaged with me as a person and while our goal is to make me feel better, it never feels like the docs are focused on the endgoal - diagonsis - and are instead focused on me and what I need and what I'm feeling. 
1	I trust my doctor because he or she does his best to do his job and be honest about it and take care of me
1	My primary care physician is always monitoring my results from lab tests and amends my medications accordingly. She is thorough and likes to be one step ahead and is calling me instantly when she sees any information she finds troubling.
-1	There is no real motivation for a doctor not to do what is best for you. He or she will get paid the same regardless of the outcome of your medical situation so there is no reason for the doctor to screw you over. 
1	the dr I refer to is my oncologist who has treated me for Stage IV breast cancer that is metastatic.  It will be 6 yrs in July that I was diagnosed and also had major surgery to remove a mass in my colon that was also cancerous.  I feel without their careful and thoughtful medical expertise I may not be alive.  I see my oncologist to check my lab levels and also to receive the next round of oral chemotherapy.  I feel it is in my best interest to trust him and I do.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she always gives a lot of choices and me which one is best for me
-1	I trust and do not trust my doctor. I believe that they will do their best to help me. Although, I also think that they might add in unneeded tests just so that they can get more money.
1	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for over 15 years. He is very honest and down to earth. I have always taken the advice of my primary care doctor with excellent results. 
-1	I feel like most Dr's are good and want to serve their patients in the best manner possible. However, there are some that are self serving and will recommend care for what is convienent or will generate the most monetary reward.
1	The reason I trust primary care physician is because because they always explain test, results and procedures in a way that I can understand exactly was is happenings
-1	I know that doctors aren't perfect, but they go through one of the most rigorous schooling systems of any profession. If they don't know the answer then nobody does.
1	I have developed a good relationship with my doctor over the years and she has always treated me well.
1	My doctor is very trustworthy I've never had a complaint yet I'm not sure if I ever will he's been in service for over 50 years
1	I trust my doctor because he seems to know what he is doing and is always super friendly. It helps that we are friends outside of work too. I feel like I could go to him about anything and he will do what is best for me no matter what it takes.
-1	Some doctors these days do not listen to what their patients are telling them. They are to much in a hurry to get to the next patient.
-1	Established patient for many years.  Doctor also has a good reputation in the community.  Primary care physician for all of my immediate family members as well as my siblings and their families.
-1	I've been seeing my doctor for a long time and he hasn't ever really steered me wrong, but I also haven't really ever dealt with any serious health problems. I have family members who have stopped seeing this doctor because they thought he wasn't taking the time necessary to deal with their conditions, but until that happens to me or if I have a condition I don't think he can handle I will continue to see him.
-1	My Primary care physician is actually pretty decent. She knows what she is talking about most of the time and is honest when she doesn't. That being said, she has been wrong about a few things, and is not as turally or holistically minded as I would like
-1	My doctor can come across as very demeaning and curt.  I think this may be because the only appt times I can make are late in the day and he is tired.  Probably more interested in ending the work day and getting home than dealing with my issues.
-1	My primary care physician has known me for majority of my life and is very thorough about what needs to be done about my medical needs.
-1	I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life.
1	 I am new to her practice, I have only been there about 2 years. I have never felt like she didn't listen to my concerns or try to help me.
-1	Again, it comes down to the fact that people can lie.  People on this planet have an ultimate goal in mind and that is to make money.  So, if a doctor is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and are essentially drug dealers, how could you trust that person ever?
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always listened to my concerns and taken time with me,  instead of rushing through my appointments.
1	She has always been open with me about her feelings and suspicions as well as the eventual official diagnosis. She treats me with respect, and, even though she knows more than me, she doesn't talk down to me when she explains things.
-1	I would say that I somewhat trust my doctor, but never completely. Because they aren't my family member or my friend.
-1	My primary care physician did not build a good rapport with me. I felt like, if I had to bring my child to an appointment, she cared more about holding my baby than caring for me
1	My primary care physician is a human being. He sometimes has some mistake but I trust him
-1	i trust my primary car doctor because she hasn't made me take anything or do anything that didn't help me. She's kind and knows all there is to know 
1	I trust my care provider she has been very understanding and very helpful with my needs she has also called my house with different concerns which is unusual for doctors to do nowadays
1	I believe my doctor is talented and capable.  I place a large amount of faith in my doctor and I feel that it is rewarded often. 
-1	Because a doctor is not trained in healing a condition, just treating.  A doctor makes additional money according to the amounts of some drugs they prescribe.
1	I feel like I get an adequate amount of feedback and explanation for their decision making to understand their thought process leading to the medical decision.
-1	I trust that my doctor tries to do well by me.  However, I think sometimes she is in too big a hurry or is distracted.  I can not trust her completely because she is only human and can make mistakes.  I have to take responsibility for my own health.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician.  Sometimes, there are things he does that's unclear at first but he's usual thorough in terms of explaining things. 
1	He seems to know what he is talking about and explains things quite well, so i trust what he tells me.  So far I have no reason not to.
1	I trust my doctors because they have taken the time to know me. They know my history. They listen to my concerns and send me for follow up. They tell me what I don't want to hear sometimes about things to improve my health. I sometimes avoid going to see them because I know they will call me out about things I didn't follow through with.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he treats me kindly.
-1	I feel like most doctors just write prescriptions for whatever condition you may have and things like diet, exercise and more holistic options are not given to the patient. I would trust my doctor more if it seemed like they knew more about things other than drugs. 
-1	The doctors who I know personally genuinely do care.So while sometimes it is a situation of covering their butts, most the time it is done for my welfare. 
1	I completely trust my Doctor because my Doctor haven't given me any reason not to. My Doctor has never prescribed me something or recommend any kind of treatment that I was skeptical of, everything my Doctor has said to me I didn't really have reason to question it.  
-1	I have a good rapport with my personal physician. I feel this way because she not only takes the time to thoroughly discuss my health, but she also spends time with me discussing issues that are not always directly or indirectly for that matter, related to my health.
-1	I distrust most doctors because I believe they are mostly concerned about money.  Most of them don't care how your health really is.
1	He is takes time to explain my care plan and why certain test are necessary  he he is attentive a compassionate 
-1	Doctors see so many patients they forget the experience is new for you, even though it may be their hundredth experience. Even though a lot of them may mean well, I would not put too much trust in their decisions because they have to answer to insurance companies as well.
-1	i suppose i trust them. i wanted to rule out some stuff, try some more their sophisticated tech there,..... 
-1	I do trust my doctors. I went to the same doctor for 21 years and when I turned 21 I was referred to a new doctor by my old doctor who I had good communication with and I believe that he referred me to a new doctor because he understood what I needed as a patient and that this doctor could help me. 
-1	Doctors are in it for the money from the health care industry. Doctors do not listen to their patients.  All they want to do is write scripts and not solve problems holistically.
-1	My doctor always seems like he's in a rush and doesn't seem like he is always concerned about answering all my questions. I think he is more concerned about getting done with each patient quickly. 
1	they are nice  and help you when  you   have  diabetes or when you are sick  and they are nice and special and caring
-1	Seems to have too much on with practices in 2 locations and not effective support to make me feel 100% trusting.. Feels a little disorganized
-1	I trust my primary care physician fully because he or she needs to build a relationship with one an other to gain the trust and to feel safe.It is important to trust them because they are smart about the information and always work in your best interest for you.
1	I have been working with my primary care doctor for several years. She has a personal connection to another organization that I work with, and a similar background to my own. She has gone out of her way to build trust and extend sincere personal insight.
-1	I have not had any problems with my doctor. The only thing i don't trust or have a problem with is when i think something needs to be checked or im worried about someone it is brushed off and not taken seriously.
1	I trust them because they seem ethical.  You lknow that feeling that you get when yoj talk to someone that means that you can just trust them?  I fet that feeling from her when I talk to her.  She's really smart and into you quite a bit when you talk with her.  Id recommend her to anyone looking for a doctor in their near future for sure!
-1	I have a general mistrust with doctors in general. I always hear of many problems and mistakes that doctors make and it make me suspicious when they tell me something. I have yet to experience this but hearing other people's story makes me feel like you can never be too careful. I like to get different opinions to make sure what he is telling me is correct.
-1	Doctors are only people. While highly trained and educated, it is important to make decisions based on what is best for me, the patient. 
1	They've never given me a reason to not trust them.
-1	Doctors are highly educated but may not have all the information regarding every disease, particularly chronic illnesses and it is always better to do your own research as long as it is done properly and well.
-1	I trust them because i have been going to them.since a baby and they are always right they would nor be a doctor if they did not know what they were doing 
-1	well sometimes its hard to trust on your primary care physician because they cant guarantee your health back and even other doctors wont  take responsibility they can just try their best to take care of a person
-1	I have no doc at the moment.  In general I trust no one so everything is approached with skepticism
1	I haven't had too many experiences with doctors, let alone bad experiences. I trust doctors for the most part and tend to take whatever medicine they provide me with. But if that medicine isn't working, I'll start to doubt my doctor.
1	I completely trust my primary care doctor because I have had the same doctor for over 15 years with no negative experiences or instances.
-1	I tend to trust my PCP because my family and I have been with him for a long time. Negative experiences with new, specialized doctors have recently led me to doubt/question all doctors.
1	I like her. I don't know her for very long but she follows up and does what she says she is going to do. She seems trustworthy so far. I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. She seems to care about her patients.
1	I trust my doctor I have been going to him for about 10 years if he has any doubt about what is wrong he refers me to a specialist. 
-1	Because theybcan totally lie to you but yeah uavent you heard of doctors lying their patients like dude that's why slwmtimes you can't just trust undone like make sure you asked of their degree and look up there history 
1	Recently finished medical training.  Listens.
-1	Because they study from a book just like me and you and ever one makes mistakes so sometimes got to help yourself 
-1	My physician has always been very helpful in getting me any information I need, even when I am asking a lot of questions. 
-1	"Doctors are generally good, but they only work with what you give them.  They make mistakes as well.  They ""practice"" medicine.  I know my body best, and many times have successfully diagnosed my own problems.  Doctors go on evidence and when they don't find any, they can sometimes dismiss you.  But I feel deep down, we as patients know when something is not right within us.  "
1	I believe that most doctors are good hearted; they do their best for the patient, Iâve only have a few bad moments with some doctors, but in general they are to be trusted.
-1	I trust my doctors advice. He would not take the chance of harming. I take his advice and do as he saya.
-1	My doctor that I used to have, I don't currently have insurance so I haven't been to the doctors in a few years even though I have a condition that needs medical treatment I don't qualify for free health insurance and I can't afford health insurance, but my previous doctor seemed to just want to get me out of the office as soon as possible and not explain things or ask questions. I also don't feel like I was examined like I should have been. The doctor would just look at me and tell me what she thought it was without any examination. 
1	I trust my PCP because she never rushes during patient visits.  She goes into detail about any test results and she asks lots of questions about my health.  When I meet with her, I feel comfortable discussing anything that may concern me and I feel confident that she will provide me with the best answer and advice that would benefit me.
1	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable. She has diagnosed issues that others were not able to pick up on. 
-1	I trust them to do their job. They have the knowledge and hopefully the honesty to do it correctly
-1	My PCP has never steered me wrong. She doesn't take chances. She sends me for testing when she thinks there is something that does not look normal. She is very honest and doesn't sugar-coat anything for me. I appreciate her honesty very much.
-1	what if a doctor is trying to get you on a medication you dont need  i know most doctors help  people some are in it for the money
-1	I do trust my doctor.  I have been seeing the same doctor for about 15 years and I know him very well.  He always has my best interest in mind.
-1	I don't trust doctors in general because most of them don't take their own advice on eating/exercise. Most of them also just flat out laugh in your face when you decide to take control over what happens to your body and just don't follow their instructions blindly. Doctors that I have been to in the past have been pushy for me to get certain shots or things that I have researched and decided I don't want. 
1	I have never had a reason to distrust my physician.  I most often go to see the physician assistant, and have trust in her as well.
-1	I don't feel as though my doctor knows me or cares that much about my well being in particular. I think he sees me just as any other patient. I think that can become dangerous because then the doctor applies a one size fits all type mentality. 
1	They're licensed. They know what will be best for you in terms of the medical field. They studied medicine for years compared to you that probably did not hence, why you are consulting a doctor.
-1	They are pill pushers Take oaths to push medication  Vaccinations are money and they push those Over helming how much insurance rules over them also 
-1	For the most part, my Primary Care Physician actually listens to what I'm saying. Because I do experience anxiety, I've had previous doctors that brushed my symptoms aside as simply anxiety and not an actual problem. My PCP isn't like that for the most part. She has questioned if it was my anxiety but believed me when I told her I could tell the difference and that it wasn't. What I don't like about her is the way that she treats the med students. She literally told one in the room with me to not ask so many questions. That made me nervous because that's how people get killed is by not asking questions.
1	My doctor is kind and confident. She never seems rushed. She always takes the time to answer my questions. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with the same person for years and my family is also with the same doctor. She has never led me in the wrong direction and I feel that she is very honest with me about my health and condition. She has tried to help me get on the right path with my diet many times and sometimes takes the role past just being a good doctor.
1	I trust my primary care physician as they have been the primary for my entire life, he's a great doctor who is very understanding and always willing to listen and pitch multiple ways of dealing with whatever is ailing me. 
-1	I don't know. I just trust my doctor. I guess she hasn't given me a reason not to trust her.
-1	They don't spend time with you and just push medication and vaccines. They get kickbacks for selling the meds.
1	I taught in medical schools and know about their selection and training.  It is a time-tested process.  The quality of practicing physicians is assured by this process.
1	She is honest with me, consistent, a very good listener and does not rush through my appointments. She takes into account my feelings and my wishes in regards to my overall health care. She does research when necessary and always provides me with informed options which we discuss together. 
1	It's usually a different doctor every time, and they are used to treating a lot of people who are poverty stricken but when they get to me they usually are very kind. 
1	Overall, I'd like to think that most doctors have their patients' best interests at heart. Through all of the knowledge they've acquired, their able to help change people's lives.
-1	I think that they are not intentionally trying to do wrong by me. However, I do know that doctors often do not have the time to keep up to date with all of the latest advances in healthcare. So it's important to double-check any recommendations yourself.
1	ive been seeing the same doctor for almost my entire life. he knows me and my situation very well. has always been good to me and my family.
1	I would trust her with my life she has always been completely open wiyh me about everything that is wrong
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been super honest and up front with me. He has always taken the time to explain everything that needs to be explained and he has never hidden anything from me when it comes to my medical conditions or illnesses. 
-1	I have been to my primary care physician twice in two years. The first time they refused to give me the full battery of STD tests I wanted. I had no reason to believe I contracted anything, but because I am non-monogamous I wanted to be responsible, and because I have a phobia of needles and needed a blood draw I figured I'd get all the blood drawing out of the way at once. I had to fight with my doctor and two secretaries for the paperwork, and then when I got my results 3 months later (great processing time - NOT) they STILL hadn't tested for anything! Planned Parenthood handles this sort of thing SO much better than a fricking Catholic Healthcare system. 
-1	For the most part, I feel that they are most knowlegeable about medicine. I have no reason not to trust their judgement for most health information.
-1	Doctors are taught to go by numbers or by what testing says.  They do not listen to what their patients symptoms.  I have hypothyroidism and have normal numbers but I still have symptoms.  My doctor insists that my symptoms have nothing to do with my thyroid.  I have done my own research and know for a fact that other thyroid patients have symptoms despite having normal numbers.   I wish my doctor would listen to my symptoms and not my numbers
1	I can talk to my doctor about anything and she offers very good advice. She is trustworthy and explains my results from test very well.
1	I trust my doctor because the things that he has suggested to me regarding my health have always helped me. My doctor is patient and listens to me when I have questions.
1	He listens to me, takes time to listen to my concerns and I feel like he tries to do the best he possibly can for my health problems.
1	He has been a family friend for many years and is always up front and kind about everything. I've never had an issue where he has not been correct about a medical issue. He treats me very professiolly at all times.
-1	it seems to work out just fine for me. I find that i can trust doctors pretty easily and have no issue in that regard because i have never had any reason to not trust them. so it works in my favor. 
1	she is the best out there, i know because we live in a small town and everyone knows everyone so everybody knows my doctor she is thoughtful explanatory and super nice
-1	what is the purpose of doctors making me healthy there is more money in people being sick black black black black 
-1	I have a tumor in my jaw and there are treatments out there for it, but it seems like the surgeons try to persuade me to have surgery without being open to other options. Only one has told me about other options.
-1	Does not take time with me. He is in and out of the room and unabale to ask him questions. He is one doctor and does not have a partner. Lack of communcation between the patient.
1	"She has always been correct with her diagnosis.  Most people would rate her low, due to the fact that she takes a lot of time with each patient, so her wait times are in the hours, at times.  However, she is spending quality time, with each patient.  Making sure she doesn't just, ""put a Band-Aid"" as a solution but she tries to find out what is causing the issue.  For example, my husband went in with a bloody nose, she didn't just give him medicine, she spent time with him and did tests to figure out why his nose kept bleeding."
1	All of my physicians are thorough, personable, and genuine. They never make me feel rushed or like they only do things that are convenient for them. They always provide me with extensive information while weighing in on the pros and cons of each possible outcome. 
-1	I think that doctors in general have my best interests in mind when I see them for a problem that I am having. But the trouble with healthcare is that it is a for profit entity and the cost and profit side of it always comes into play.
-1	I don't usually trust doctors to treat patients as individuals, but instead use a one size fits all approach, by which I mean over-issuing prescription medications instead of offering alternative solutions for curing and/or managing health conditions.
1	I've been to many doctors but my current Doctor is very nice and explains everything in a Manor I can understand and is always on time and doesn't keep me waiting
1	She explains all my medications are for and what any procedure is for and why. I have trust in her. I can get appointment in between my regular appointments if needed without any problems.
-1	I do trust my doctor, she seems very informed, and she never takes a guess unless she is sure. I appreciate how organized and detail-oriented she is. My reservations mostly come from my hesitation to fully trust in another person. While medicine has been revolutionized, it is still not an exact science, and things can go wrong at any moment, so while I do trust my doctor, I am not sure I would ever 100% accept everything they told me without some reservations about their correct diagnosis. 
-1	I primarily trust my doctor. She seems to be interested in what's best for me, not necessarily what's fastest or most convenient.
-1	they do a good job.i trus there work.am happy with there work.why not there here to help us.i will be working with theme for a long time.
1	I feel like my doctor care and shows interest in what l have to say. Does make me feel bad for asking silly questions. 
-1	In the 1950's a medical career was a vocation of helping others despite the fact that it paid much more in respect than money. By the late 1960's medical school had become a hard, but sure way to wealth. Too many are focused on the payoff today. 
-1	The medical establishment is a business. Most doctors in the US are not from here, where are all the American doctors? The medical industrial complex is about  relieving problems for the most part, not curing all the time.
1	My doctor takes the time to explain my over all health and where it should be. My doctor also takes the time to listen to my concerns and explains all my options as well as the risk of those options
1	i trust my physical because if there is any problem at any time of the day, i know she will be there for me. 
-1	I just dread goin to see a doctor for anything cause I don't like bad health news. if its all the same I would rather have no news than bad news
1	My primary care physician takes the time to go through what has gone on since the last time I've seen them.  They go through all of my medications.  They do an exam and go over any and all symptoms I may be having. They thoroughly discuss any labwork that was completed and then discuss all options for changes.  I trust their opinion because they take time with me. 
1	This is hard because my doctor of over twenty odd years recently retired. I have only seen my new doctor a couple of times. But she was recommended by my previous doctor, so my trust is heightened. I guess it is safe to say that in general, I trust all doctors to know what they are doing.
-1	i trust my doctor because of their experience but i am always up for other doctors opinions as well. It is always okay to ask other doctors and to get an second opinion.
-1	I feel slightly distrustful of them because they need to push certain diagnosis and drugs and are overworked and overbooked.
-1	My PCP has demonstrated competence and a comprehensive knowledge about any issues I take to him.  He's great!
-1	I don't trust a lot of doctors. Not all doctors in medical field are there for patient health, just money for lining their pockets. Not for well being of patients.
-1	She is easily distracted by other things it seems.
-1	i have little trust in doctors.I have had to fire them because of their care less and evil verbal abuse.When give detailed testing procedures I had to refuse the action as it was a sure failure and would spread the current infection.I was offered perscriptions that were incorrect.I knew what would work but the doctor did not know for one month.Had I not been able to deal with the infection I would lost a life.
-1	I don't trust him because a few years ago he prescribed medication for high blood pressure that almost killed me. The side-affects were so bad I had to go into the er room.
1	I trust my dr because after not going to one in 14 years, I filly found one and she makes me feel safe and respected. 
-1	He's been my doctor since I was a teeger. He is pretty blunt about telling you what is going and why. He is pretty thorough in his questions too. But if you smoke or anything, he'll tell you to expect a stroke.
-1	"My doctor doesn't take the time to listen. She makes it a priority to only spend so much time with you. She even said to me last time ""I don't think I'll have time for that today"" Didn't offer another appointment either. It was an issue I was really concerned about. I told her I was worried and she did give me an extra 3 minutes and a referral. I'm glad I'm being assigned a new doctor in a month "
-1	I don't have a primary doctor but would like to think that doctors in general are mainly looking out for patients' best interest.
-1	Sometimes he seems rushed and he might get benefits from recommending certain treatment to me, so I try to assess things objectively.
-1	I distrust my primary care physicial somewhat because their primary obligation might not be to me, but instead to their career and their financial obligations.  Plenty of doctors have plenty of lawyers to offset complications of medical errors and other eugenicidal malfeasance.
-1	my doctor always seems rushed and doesn't always have time to listen to my concerns. I typically get the bare minimum and then look things up online for myself
1	I have never had an issue with my physician, she's always right with her diagnosis. She is also extremely thorough 
1	He is quite professional, well schooled and has good office technology.  He can be reached online and someone always answers phone.
-1	I have a rare condition and itâs obvious my pcp does not know a whole lot about it. Also I feel like doctors are rushed and donât take the time to do the best care
1	My physician is up-front at all times. She will tell you like it is, answers all questions. After lab work is completed can always expect a call in two or three days with results. She will take the time to explain or answer all questions.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to ask my opinion on which way I would prefer to go for certain treatments of issues I've had. She will give me information and her opinion and statistics but she ultimately will let me decide which route I would prefer to take.
-1	I usually trust what my PCP tells me and recommends. I have only had a couple of bad experiences with doctors, throughout my lifetime.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I am paying them to perform a service and trust that they have my best interest in hand. 
1	I haven't been to my primary care physician in a while due to no longer having health insurance, but I'll do my best to explain. I typically take good care of myself and try to avoid going to the doctor's office at all costs. The main reason that I would visit her is because of my IBS, which is something that she also suffers from, so I know that she understands what I'm going through. More generally, you never feel like you're being rushed. She always listens to whatever you need to say about your issues, no matter how long you go on about it.
1	My doctor has a great reputation with his patients.  He's been a great doctor and has treatment effectively when other doctors have not been successful.  He makes sure I understand everything before leaving his office.
1	I have complete trust in my family physician.
-1	It isn't that I distrust but the primary care physician should not have you come in more than twice a year. If you go into much even if you are fine the physician will not tell you to stop if it is your choice because they are there to help you.
1	I trust my primary care physician. My primary care physician always tells me what is going on with my health and answers all of my questions. She recommends things and tells me how I might feel during procedures which turned out to be true.
-1	I feel that most doctors become doctors in order to do good and help people, however a few can let greed and selfishness get in the way of their original goals. I have been fortunate to have mostly positive interactions with my medical professionals throughout my life. 
-1	It seems to me that more and more doctors are spread too thin in their practice having to see a maximum number of patients in as little time as possible, creating a less thorough exam or alysis of symptoms/ testing.
-1	They are in it for the money. They do not actually care.
-1	physicians tend to look out for themselves and only provide medical advice/prescriptions based on what pharmaceutical company is paying them the most. They are overworked and don't spend enough time with their patients. 
1	I have learned to be very selective in choosing who I work with as a health care provider. If I find myself in a situation where I don't believe the provider is communicating on my level, or if they raise their voice or are clearly not concerned about my quality of life, I will cease to be their patient as soon as possible and find other practitioners. I also, have, on occasion, written letters of complaint to practitioners. The physician I currently am seeing is someone I've had a relationship with all my life, and from her way of communicating, I can see that she has good judgement.
-1	It very good thing and I like to go to you doing fine I hope you get back to take care myself, you doing fine I hope you get back to take care
-1	I have a genuine trust in doctors for the simple fact a doctor's isn't afforded mistakes. If a health care provider makes an occupational they could possibly be subjected to legal ramifications.
1	I had the same doctor growing up and for a few years into adulthood. When I became a nurse I started noticing that my doctor seemed to just want to get out of the room and didn't really seem to care much. I switched doctors several times before finding the one I am currently a patient of and he is amazing. He truly cares and takes time with each patient to provide the best care possible.
-1	always very trustworthy, been going to the same doctor for 10 years now, always very good to me and treats me right, i don't feel like they are doing anything that would make me distrust them
1	I have been going to my primary care physician for a long time now, so I understand his methods and we have a relationship. He knows my habits and health concerns, and he never hesitates to tell me the good and the bad. He let me see the reports and exam results so I can see for myself what is happening, and he'll answer any questions I have. 
-1	well i should trust the person that went to study to become a doctor and they should know what they are doing honestly or they are in the wrong field
-1	I believe I have a good doctor who takes the time to understand my concerns and history. Goes through options and recommendations.
-1	I just started with a new doctor, and she is young and persoble. She listens intently, asks me about my choices, and offers a variety of possible treatment plans. I greatly appreciate that after my previous doctor, who was nice but more interested in pushing supplements she had a fincial interest in.
-1	I spent time finding my primary care,  he's someone that is not overly difficult to talk to and has helped me with issues I previously was uncomfortable with other doctors.  He always gives me many options for medication with the materials to study them. 
-1	Ibdint go to the doctor often only recently started to see a therapist. That is the only time which is staring out to be twice per week.
-1	i trust my doctor fully...if i didn't i would switch doctors as soon as possible.... i have had my doctor for most of my life
1	My physician is a problem solver who looks at variables and offers options to deal with the issue. She then let's me make the final decision.
-1	I think medical caregivers, doctors, and nurses are just in it for the money. A lot of them don't care about their patients. You become a number.
-1	I have never been to trustworthy when it comes to people of the medical staff just do to many story I hear from my friends and family about what has happened to them.
-1	He has always been honest with me. He gives the expression that he undetstands and cares about how i feel. 
-1	I don't currently have a PCP, but have had two children in under 2 years, so I am answering in regard to my OB/GYN. Unfortunately, the Banner office I go to does not allow me to see my regular doctor all of the time and forces you to rotate through doctors. There are 3 that I really like and trust and the rest I do not know so well. Also, during my latest labor (Sept 2017), the doctor told me we needed to use the vacuum because my son's heart rate was dipping. I pushed him out on the next try, after she had already attached he vacuum. Even though it wasn't used to extract him, he now has a calcified bump on his head from the vacuum suction. I do not feel like I was given other choices in the moment. 
-1	I trust my doctor and have a lot of faith in her. I like it that she is a primary care as well as internist.
-1	She is the best doctor i know helpful concerned and strait to the point always informs me on what i need to know
-1	I feel that doctors do their job to the best of their ability but at the end of the day ethnic race and money is their main concern. If you have a condition that could be highly expensive and you have Medicaid like me then I doubt that they will tell you anything until it's too late.
1	My Dr is very young and the new Drs do things differently than the old drs.  They are much more attentive than the old drs.  They also ask more questions which prompts me to explain more.
-1	Doctors generally have other considerations besides a patient's optimal treatment. They can be fincially influenced by pharmaceutical organizations and recommend newer and different medications. They can also be driven by profits when recommending procedures that may not be necessary. They also may avoid certain treatments because they do not have the knowledge to recommend them, or they may want to avoid liability. 
-1	I trust that my primary care physician makes good choices and care about me. He is very knowledgeable about his expertise and always very patient to answer my questions. He will analysis different options to me and don't pressure me to make a choice he preferred.
1	My doctor is very well educated and experienced. He is warm and approachable and always tells me the plus and minuses regarding medicines and treatments I need.
-1	Have confidence in my physician. Great bedside manner. Seems to care about patients. Diagnosis are usually spot on. Great follow up care. My only complaint about any physician is that they are rushed and overwhelmed. I  guess it's because we don't have enough  physicians. 
-1	I do trust my primary care physician basically because she has never given me a reason not to trust her.  I think she is kind and caring, and she has never misled me in the past.  She has been helpful any time I have gone to see her. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because first off, he always remembers me, even when I have not seen him in quite some time. He is very personable towards me and makes me feel comfortable. He allows me to express what I feel that I need before making his own professional recommendations.
-1	I trust them because i know them and they know me well. I dont really have any distrust for him and overall i dont see why i would with anyone else.
1	 I trust my primary doctor. He has been my doctor for over 20 years. Even when I was away for several years he remembered me and what condition I was suffering from 15 years ago.
-1	I have a primary care physician. He is trained well and a well learned. He serves me on a good faith. I am satisfied upon him.
-1	When it comes to protecting your physical health, being able to communicate with your doctor openly and without reservation is essential. When you have a primary care physician that you trust, you are more likely to discuss any health concerns that you have, ask questions about your treatment options, and comply with your doctorâs medical recommendations
-1	My doctor is thorough, but he can't know everything. I can't totally trust him or any doctor, knowing that they may not be able to find the answer. 
1	My doctor listens to me, anything I'm concerned about. He helps me adjust basal rates on my pump, goes over test results and explains any I might be concerned about. He understood my resistance to getting an insulin pump at first when he suggested it. I had been battling breast cancer and had spent several months being operated on, reconstructed, poked, probed, had chemo pumped into my system and just needed a break . A year later I was ready to talk to him about it and he got me set up with one.
1	If I didn't completely trust her, she wouldn't be my PCP.  Health care is too important to leave in the hands of someone I don't trust and/or cannot communicate with.
1	I have gone to the same primary care physician for the past twenty years.  He has always been patient, upfront, and honest with me.  He has never given me a reason to second guess his intentions or information. 
1	I been seeing my doctor for several years.  He has always been helpful and profession when my family or I are sick.
1	my doctor is very good she takes good care of me tells me how to do my blood levels so they stay good and always takes the time to do things right
1	MY DOCTOR IS CARING,AND HE GOES ABOVE AND BEHIND MY HEALTHCARE. HE TAKES THE TIME TO CHECK ON ALWAYS GIVES ME RESULTS ON MY TEST RESULTS
-1	I believe that my doctor is honest and trustworthy, but with all of the resources out there on the internet to research your health symptoms, it is hard for me to put complete trust in my doctor. I have also heard so many stories of people being misdiagnosed and the results were almost catastrophic! I have always been told to trust my instincts if I think that something is not right. That makes me so nervous to just accept what doctors tell me. I also ask for extra testing or information to double, even triple check what my doctor is telling me.
1	My doctor is the doctor to all of my family members and we have all have had good experiences with him
-1	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to talk to me to understand what my symptoms are and determine what the course of treatment should be.
-1	My primary care physician seems inexperienced and doesn't give an educated opinion of my symptoms. She doesn't ask many questions of give helpful solutions to my medical problems.
1	she been my doctor for so many years and all the sickness i had she got me through all of them. she alway tell me what is wrong and what i need to take and do to get better
1	I trust him because of how long I have known him.  It has been so long and I have seen him so many times that the trust grew.  I know about his family and other things about him.  Plus since he has done many procedures on me and I am healthier because of them I trust him.  He has not let me down and is there for me when I need anything including just to talk.  He takes his time with me which is important.
-1	I mostly trust my primary care physician. She is patient, answers any questions that I have, & seems to suggest the right course of action for me.
-1	I feel like they care more about the business of making people sick and medicine.  Rather than the person whose coming for help. I also have been told that I was too big and lazy. I'm 5ft 7.5 inches tall and only weighed 160 pounds.
1	My doctor would have nothing to gain from lying to me, so it would be their best interest to to be honest with me at all times
-1	I know he receives samples from pharm reps. I also know that is what I'll be walking out of his office with. 
-1	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy. As human beings, they do have biases, and they do make mistakes, so it's important for patients to educate themselves, ask questions, and so on, but on average I feel people in the medical profession can be trusted to know how to do their jobs.
-1	i have seen my primary care doctor for years now and i feel she has the best interest of me in her mind
-1	Although doctors have to function in quick way due to overwhelming amounts of daily patients, it is unlikely that they have any bad intentions in mind. In my persol experience my doctor has always been honest and upfront with treatments and diagnosis.
1	While I was in the Army, I had no trust in my medical professionals. Now that I am a civilian, my doctors seem to actively listen and care about solving any issues that arise. 
-1	I haven't been with my primary care doctor for very long, so while I don't have a reason to distrust him, I haven't built up enough of a strong relationship yet.
-1	I trust the medical expertise of the doctor. I do not, however, trust that they are doing the right thing all the time. My doctor's office, like others, is clearly there for insurance money, making us get lots of tests.
-1	Because it would lead towards others not being truthful with their things
1	The doctor for me in question is my OB/GYN who I actually work for. I trust her due to the fact that she tells pts how it is without sugar coating anything while still having compassion 
1	It took me a while to find my current doctor because I wanted someone who listens and seems to care about me. I completely trust my doctor because he is an excellent listener and cares very much about my well being, he takes his job extremely seriously and I can tell he does this because he truly does care for people.
1	No I can not explain any of this. It's just how I feel about this subject. It's difficult for me to express my thoughts in writing.
-1	My doctor has a lot of patients so she has to see them all she might miss something I need medically 
-1	I believe the medical field is too dependent on money, creating big profits while minimizing care to patients.  This trickles down most heavily on the doctors who make the call to run certain tests or not and to dedicate enough time to caring for patients.  I believe there is too much pressure on doctors to overmedicate patients as well.
1	I feel my doctor (or nurse practitioner) has my best interests in mind because she is always thorough and helpful when we meet with her.  She listens and troubleshoots any issues we have. 
1	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because I have complete confidence in him.  He's been my PCP for over 16 years.  
-1	I mostly trust my doctor but sometimes I feel like they would rather just throw medication at the issue instead of discussing other alternatives. 
1	I've been with the same primary physician for 20yrs, I trust her and depend on her. She always has my best interest at heart.
-1	TRUST A LITTLE BECAUSE THEY ARE DOCTOR'S AND PRETTY SURE THEY DONT WANT TO BE SUED, SO THATS WHY I TRUST THEM. BUT SOMETIMES I DONT BECAUSE THEY JUST MIGHT BE DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.
-1	Sometimes I do trust but there are times when I feel I could take other medication that could be more helpful but doctors are so afraid these days of prescribing narcotic pain killers
-1	because they try to lie to me that im going to be fine when in reality im not fine....
1	I trust my doctor, because she is very thourough, and very careful. She is ver concervative in prescribing any and all medications. Sometimes I wish she wasn't so concervative, but I'm grateful she is. Most Drs. just throw medication at you, she does not. She looks for other alternatives first, if that doesn't work, they she'll try meds, but very concervatively.
1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for over a decade. She is always willing to listen to my concerns, sets aside enough time to answer any questions I have, and is always willing to listen to any input I want to offer & make any needed modifications to any needed treatment accordingly. I trust her primarily because she has demonstrated, over a number of years, that she is trustworthy.
-1	he is a position of trust and its his job to help patients, and has a lot of years learning how to do this job correctly
-1	I trust my primary care physician when we talk about what could be wrong, and early treatments.  However I always go online and take a look about what I can find and see what other options are.  I know that the health system is not perfect, and I try to minimize doing anything unnecessary.
-1	it depends on the person. not all doctors are good
-1	My primary care physician sometimes seems to be in a hurry on days when he has a lot of patients to see, so he does not ask me many questions on those days. If I have any symptoms that are bothering me, then I would have to make sure to point them out to him myself when he is in a hurry. He always prescribes treatment or orders tests to learn what is wrong, so he can prescribe accurate medicines.
-1	Nothing is gonna go so bad. Don't worry about a thing because every little thing is gonna be alright
1	I trust my doctor because I've been with him for years, and through those years, I've become healthier and happier by following his advice. I was overweight and unhealthy just a couple years back, and because of a healthy routine prescribed by my doctor, I've shed pounds and am much healthier today.
1	The reason I trust doctors is... in my experience with doctors I have not come up on too may times at all to give me a reason to mistrust my doctor...they have all been truthful and honest with me
-1	For me personally, I spent several years with an diagnosed problem, despite how often I was going to see my doctor about the problem.  Being that this problem was causing incredible pain, I am a bit distrustful of both my doctor and doctors in general.  I do not blame my doctor for missing it, but I do blame them for not even suggesting that my problem could have even been the cause.
1	the reason by take this survey is easy, medical situacion in my household is critic, i can produce this service with surveys.
1	I feel that my doctor is typically very attentive and does a thorough job. However, there are times where it feels like they might be rushing a bit. If I ever had something serious going on, I would definitely seek a second opinion so I do not blindly trust my doctor. 
1	I trust my doctor because the information he has provided has been accurate and in line with any additional testing I have had done. 
1	I had cancer and a knee replacement.. and Id say shes always  given me the best advice.. and always been very caring..and if i have any questions shes always been caring and thoughtful
1	doctors have the education that is why it is not easy to become one. all the classes you have to complete.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing this doctor for twenty-plus years. He always takes the time to explain things and ask questions to understand what is going on with me. I always get the proper treatment for whatever ails me.
-1	It is my opinion that a lot of doctors are just out for the money and they want to rush you out and get the next patient in.  I do not think all doctors are like that but I do think that when someone is looking for a blocked or to choose they should really make sure they feel comfortable that they're getting treated properly.   Also if you have something majorly wrong with you I believe that a second or even a 3rd opinion is a good idea.   I believe it's called a practice because no doctors perfect and every doctor it continuously learning.  When experience I recently had is I was sent to the emergency room with a stomach related problem the doctors was full and I got sent to the heart floor for an overnight visit.   They gave me an EKG even though I was not there for my heart in charge me anyways even though I disputed it.   I am they're young and have a very healthy heart there was no reason for that.
-1	I trust my primary care physician she is always so helpful and nice. She has been with me for a very long time. Ive been with her for over 10 years. She has helped me through a lot of medical issues I have had.
-1	I had a doctor to whom I gave 100% trust because he earned it. Now that I have that person as a comparison, my current doctor falls well short in knowledge and patient advocacy.
1	I have not had any sort of medical situation that would require me to analyze the extent to which I trust my physicians so right now I really have no reason not to.
1	i trust my primary care physician because when i see her she calls personally to give me my test results and after and before examinations she always asks a ton of questions about my health to make sure that I'm healthy and i understand everything she said and the things we discussed
-1	Doctors are not trained to find out what is really going on with a patient instead they are paid off by big Pharma to prescribe
-1	A lot of MDs think that they are Gods. Holier than thou..not interested in the patients cares or needs..just their agenda..i dont trust all of them
1	I trust my primary care physician because he will tell me what is best for my health and not what will make him money. If I feel like a path of health will not work for me we change it. He is very receptive to my feelings.  
1	One of the major reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has being our family doctor for years and treats us so well with kindness and strong hand atimes when necessary
1	down to earth, admits when he doesnt know something, is more then helpful and up front
-1	He is very straightforward and doesn't sugarcoat what is happening with me. He talks very calmly and in a caring way.
-1	Doctors are willing to prescribe drugs that do not work and have proven records of causing more pain. Doctors are actually drug pushers.
-1	I don't know if you are not the intended addressee please notify the system is not important also with the group chat with you and I will be deleted on my phone
-1	I don't have a lot of trust in doctors in general, but when a emergency happens there's nothing I can do but seek professional care
-1	Pharmaceutical companies, among others, have changed how doctors conduct their business and it has not changed to benefit the patient.
-1	I would hope for the most part, they are honest with me and I can trust them, but you hear of so many things that happen, and they are so pressed for time usually, that I am always afraid they don't tell you everything in the limited amount of time you are there. My husband recently had to get something done, and they convenient left out some of the adverse side effects.
-1	my doctor has been very open and honest with me about my health and the things i should be doing and avoiding. she does not sugar coat anything but she is also compassionate when relating her message across to me which makes me feel more comfortable and apt to listening to her medical advice.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been our family doctor for more than 15 years and all his diagnostics and treatments have been accurate. He always gives us advises and we feel that he cares about our well being.
-1	For the most part I trust his knowledge.  I think the problem lies in our approaches to medical conditions. I am more interested in natural drug free options.  He may not always agree but he will allow me to make my own decisions.  
-1	I dont trust my doctor because he asked me what medicines i think i should be perscribed.He takes very little time in getting to know what the problem is.He is always in a hurry to be done with the appointment and does not explain things very well
1	Because she always goes out of her way just o male sure things get done safetly and effectively. I've been with her for years and don't plan to change to someone else 
-1	Because he is a very good physician and he has been honest and trust worthy in the past, so I have no reason not to trust him, and so far he has been right with the medical issues with me.
-1	He or she doesnt listen to me. They tell me what they believe to be wrong or right with me. I believe they just want peopls money and that they arent looking out for our best interest. I do trust some doctors but most of them I dont.
1	While both my wife and I are under care with the VA system, both our doctors spend the time needed to explain what's going on, why something is happening, and the best path to follow, particularly conserning my wife's ongoing condition.
-1	They tend to go for the easiest and quickest solution possible so they can see as many patients a day as possible. They are not after helping people, they are after making money.
-1	I have never really had an experience where I totally trusted a doctor. I usually go for annual physical exams and it doesn't seem like they really check all the things they should be checking. I think they have a routine to go through and there's very little else above that.  
-1	I don't trust physicians,They are known to make mistakes thayt can endanger lives. They can give wrong medicine.
-1	The reason why I trust the doctor is because they care about people health also the be knowing what they be talking about most of the time
1	i trust them because I have known them for a long time and they have done very well by me, he listens to me and lets me talk and give my opinions
1	I am able to reach my  physician by e mail or phone and get a reply back in a timely manner if it is needed. They are helpful in keeping any RX's refilled and providing me with the results of my tests along with any recommendations. 
-1	Almost all drs in this country have to follow the deranged findings of the government and the funding of the drug companies. 
-1	My PCP is always trying to push a medication that I don't necessarily need and always jumps to prescribing meds instead of looking for other solutions to a medical problem.  At times they also forget to physically examine me, just simply prescribing a medication.  There are drug information pamphlets all over the office and this puts doubt as to whether my PCP has a conflict of interest or not. 
-1	My doctor is pretty conventiol and doesn't explore any new avenues of thinking. Sometimes I have to offer him ideas on what might help me.
-1	I assume they have the relevant information, training, and experience to make the recommendations they do, and follow from there.
-1	I've had Dr Flores for over 4 years and she knows me pretty well. She is a Christian doctor and tries to get things through to me so I will heal better.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she does what's best for me, helps me feel safe, and tells me everything.
1	My primary care physician has the qualifications and the experience to make the right decisions. She also takes into consideration my opinion and strives to give me the highest quality of life she can.
-1	A doctor just does not have time to provide a high level of service to every patient, even if they are motivated to do so. They are also subject to fatigue, influence from drug manufacturers, and biases. Sometimes their knowledge can be outdated, if they are decades into their career, or too green, if they are brand new doctors. 
-1	Sometimes I feel that instead of placing my well being first they instead place money first which lowers my trust in them
-1	I see a do and not an md because a do treats the whole body and not just the symptoms.  I also see an acupuncturist on a regular basis.
1	Honestly, my doctor is from my community and i have this doctor as our family doctor since last 7 years. From the experience my doctor is being honest about our health condition.
-1	Doctors are people who can make mistakes. My issue is less that I distrust my primary care physician, but more that I do not trust him/her completely. No professional should be trusted completely, and patients need to have basic critical thinking skills when seeing a doctor. 
-1	i trust my primary care physician because he is very good. He takes time to talk and listen to you. he is very nice and encouraging and honest.
1	My doctor is ethical is her behavior. I have witnessed her bedside manner and he skills in action. Her patients and colleagues admire her. 
1	With the info you give them and the info they have a round then you can stand back and trust then that they are looking out for you
1	My doctor is always very thorough when I see him. I've never had any issues with him, like being misdiagnosed or given a medication that I reacted badly to. I've generally had a positive experience with my current primary care physician. I trust that he knows what he is doing. 
1	I just like him and he is knowledgeable.  I can always research on the internet.  He answers my questions and is patient and kind.
-1	PCPs can be shadowed by other influences such as medical companies to push their products for kickbacks.  This is not true for every PCP but it is known.
-1	I don't necessarily distrust them, but overall they just want the salary and some of them are being paid by pharmaceutical companies for certain drugs 
-1	Doctors are human. They have their own interests like everyone else. So there is going to be bias in there decisions.
1	I completely trust my doctor and his judgment. Thus far, he has always been professional, yet caring and compassionate. He fully explains his decisions and why they are the best for me. All of the risks and benefits or each option are given to me, as well as what he thinks is best and why. My doctor will also explain other options and why he would or would not choose them. 
-1	"i just started seeing my new primary care this year. i have a reasoble amount of trust in her, though i believe most doctors are very traditiol in their methods and i like to know about ""outside the box"" treatments, such as holistic methods. i like to do my own research on the issues i face and often times doctors don't want to hear what ""dr. google"" has to say."
-1	My primary care physician has led me astray before, and a substitute doctor almost killed me. I had issues with my gall bladder and my doctor did not catch the signs of that happening, even though I was making appointments for a knee issue. Also, my knee issue was misdiagnosed as well. She did do a good job telling me all the treatments available for my knee issue, and she did diagnose the arthritis in my foot accurately.
-1	i dont typically go to a doctor something i need to start doing again in the very near future.. i was addicted to drugs and let my health go just began recovery getting back to health is important to me gain
-1	Most doctors have the best in mind for you. I usually trust most doctors and because I can often understand what is going on, I can agree or disagree and understand rationale because of my health care background. Very rarely do I find a doctor that I don't trust at all, if at all. Sometimes they aren't the most thorough, but if I feel the need to tell them to assess something, I will. I keep open communication and talk with them frequently, especially in the patient room and clarify things that I don't understand or need more explanation. 
-1	I know that doctors are busy and cannot know the details of every case. So asking questions to get more information can help. I don't think it is intentional, just impossible to have another person who rarely sees me to know what will be best for my life in some situations. 
-1	I feel they know what is going on with me and they know what I need medical wise. I feel that they have my best interest in mind.
-1	I recently started with a new primary doctor and I don't trust her.  She has not been very helpful and just wants to send me off to other specialists.  She's not really helping me.
-1	The medical field in my observation us more focused on insurance and getting paid well rather than helping people. It is all about how much money the medical field can get and with insurance how much the insurances can save on patients.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he/she is a doctor and they know what there are doing they are not going to intentionally harm me or loose the right to practice because of negligence 
1	My dr sits down and goes into detail answering my question and explaining any new medication she is giving me.
-1	I lost a lot of trust in the medical field in general and especially with doctors while uncovering some information over the years. When I have learned that companies pay doctors to push their pharmaceuticals and also offer them incentive for prescribing their products and meeting up with them. Uncovering things like this just added to the distrust in the medical profession. 
1	he or she spent the time to do the hours for whatever good/bad reason to get the degree and then try to keep up, which maybe nerar imposssible
1	He has always been open and honest about everything and fully explains what is going on or what he is doing.  He will give me all my options and let me make a decision or give his opinion as to what is best but still let me decide. 
-1	"I trust my PCP to a certain extent, not because I feel that she has negative motives, but more because I know she is human and prone to make mistakes just like everyone else. I know she may have a bad day and may not be at her best. So while I trust her medical knowledge, I don""t put 100% faith in everything she says or does."
-1	I dont have one. My choicce.I have to much knowledge about health that most medical staff cant handle me. 
1	I trust my doctor because he gets very personal and not just all about the work. He actually makes time to have regular conversations to make you comfortable 
-1	I generally trust doctors to offer their best insights based on their knowledge and experience, which far surpasses mine as it relates to general health concerns. So I am open-minded enough to entertain any advice they offer. However, I'm also assertive enough to make my own thoughts and questions known so that together, hopefully, we determine the best plan for my personal health. 
1	He answers my questions, he listens to my health concerns and then tells me what hes going to do for me
-1	It is not that I do not trust my primary care physician, it's just that I am not sure he is giving me the best information or just the information he gives to everyone.
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because she is so thorough at each visit.  She really listens to me intently.  I never feel like she is in a hurry.  After she addresses what issues I came for, she always ask how I have been.
-1	I trust doctors in general because they know the right things to do in order to improve your condition. They have the right response every single time.
1	I trust my doctor because I have no reason not to trust them. I would hope that they tell me the truth no matter what and want the best for me. 
-1	I believe even though doctors I've had many years of schooling they can still make mistakes because they are human too
-1	"I don't ask a whole lot of good questions, so I'm just like ""I guess you have the degree and experience, so whatever you say."" Maybe this is trusting enough but maybe this doesn't allow me the best control of my health."
-1	for the most part I trust my various drs, and follow their recommendations. however when it comes to taking prescription medications, I am reluctant to add any to the ones I already take, and feel that sometimes drs are too ready to pull out the rx pad.
-1	my doctor makes me nervous. sometimes i feel belittled. sometimes i understand things but not fully and do not want to seem dumb so don't ask for examples. 
1	I trust mu doctor because he is thorough.  He explains all the possibilities and potential consequences when making a diagnosis and offering treatment.  He then asks allows me to make the decision given the information presented.
-1	I don't really have an opinion of most doctors. Some are good and some are shitty.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor as he is a quite a bit honest person, and very direct on any health topics, and provides different options and explains everything very clearly and answers thoroughly any questions I might have, and even he listens to me and try to understand my feelings on some sensitive topics. He is also one of the highest rated doctor in my area as a trustworthy doctor. So so net net my experience with him is very good that is why I trust him.
-1	In my many years of dealing with people I have never found one I really trust to any great extent, certainly not with my life.
-1	My physician is quite busy and this can lead him to be curt or even impatient when asked for options or explanations. He normally thorough in his treatment but can get antsy when asked to explain himself or to clarify something he has said. I think he assumes that people will give his schedule as much priority as he does.
1	I've never been given a reason to distrust him and I haven't been steered wrong yet so until that happens hes good in my book
1	I have been going to my doctor for a very long time now. When ever I have a pain or any other problem with my health I head over to his office. With my major back pain issues he has always been stright forward with me. Always telling me the truth straight to my face even when I might not like it. He has always been correct about the cause of the pains or illnesses. His procedures and getting better plans have had a one hundred percent rate of effectiveness and I have always gotten better when I follow his instructions. I trust him because he gets things done correctly.
1	My doctor is a very good doctor, who i trust completely. I have been seeing her for the past 4 year. I feel that she always tells me the truth and looks out for my bet interest. Anytime that i feel something is wrong she always listens to me and doesnt blow me off. There has been times when she has made appointments for me for follow ups, within like a week. I have not had others doctors do that
-1	why not trust someone whose job is to make you better? its their job so i feel like they would want to be honest and help me as much as they can
1	I feel those called to such a high involvement with the human condition deserve our respect and ultimately admiration. The rigors of their study and training predispose them to being credible.
-1	Most of them are paid to push certain drugs on me.  I have a condition that through many doctors, i am uble to ever have two of them agree about it.  I constantly get conflicting info about it.
-1	My primary care doctor has a good bedside manner,she's very thorough when she explains everything to me.She tells me what she thinks I need or don't need for my care.
-1	My doctor is usually backed up and busy and I usually feel rushed and that he is just trying to get to the next patient
-1	Many doctors are too busy to listen to their patients. Some have a horrible bedside manner and it makes the patients feel uncomfortable to ask important questions. If a doctor is to be trusted, they need to listen to the patient. They need to show compassion and understanding, while maintaining a professional demeanor.
-1	I trust her because she never seems in a rush and always has time for my questions or concerns.  She does not just shove a drug at me and send me on my way.
-1	Sometimes I feel that my physical don't listen to what I am telling her. She focus more on not giving out to much medication to her patients. I understand that she have to be careful, but it leaves me in pain and still sick.
1	I hardly ever see my physician, but during the times I have seen him, I feel like he listens to what I'm saying and has offered good suggestions.
-1	Often times its feels as if the primary care physicians, allergists, and other doctors will sometimes make things worse than what they really are at the time. Sometimes it is like they want the patient to spend more money out of pocket and constantly come back for nothing.
1	My doctor is very paiteint with me and other paitients. She takes the time to explain things and answers all questions I have. I never feel that I am inconveniencing her when I visit with a problem.
1	My doctor is very trust worthy I have been their patient for a long time.  They listen to my symptoms and take good care of me.
1	I trust my PCP because I have been going to see her for a long time and I know she values me as an individual.
1	I answered this about my mother's main surgeon. He removed her colon, ovaries, uterus, gallbladder, appendix and spleen. We went through four surgeon consults before I found the one we have now. I kept going back to our PCP and getting additiol referrals until I found one I liked. The first four were complete nightmares.They had neither the time or inclition to answer my questions thoroughly and were arrogant. I refuse to accept sub par medical care. I think hospitalists should get with the program and understand that their patients are CONSUMERS and while they are selling a highly specialized product, they do not have a monopoly.
1	I trust my doctor because my doctor would like the best for me. My doctor would help me take care of my health by telling me what healthy foods to eat. They would also help me by telling me what vitamins i can take.
1	My doctor is upbeat and personable.  She is younger than my previous doctor who was wonderful.  I trust her because she looks out for my best interests and does not insist I take drugs that I deem unsafe.  She is very knowlageable and competent.
1	Doctors are humans, and make mistakes.   Patients are individuals, and not a one fit works for all of us.   What may work perfectly for others, may be an awful thing for me.   
-1	My primary care physician has been with me for a long time and understands my health best. He seems to genuinely care about his patients which makes it easy to give my trust. 
1	My primary care physician is the only physician that I've had so far that hasn't made me feel bad about my body or my health decisions. She works with me to come up with the best plan and answers any questions I have about my treatment. 
-1	Most doctors care more about cost than patient care.
-1	I do trust my former PCP, The new one at the VA seems to be very untrustworthy; as she comes to conclusions without efficient data, and that send up flags. For my newest psychiatrist at the VA; he too jumped to a conclusion in only one meeting(today), therefore I don't trust him either. especially when he is not paying attention to detail such as body language and whatnot. Nor did he want my 5 plus yrs of documentation from my former psychiatrist. 
1	I distrust the doctor sometimes because I'm unable at times to get proper medicine I need for pain. However, I do trust the doctor with filling me in on information about my health.
-1	I have been seeing this doctor for some time for a serious illness. So far they have maged it quite well so I trust their judgement
1	My doctor is very knowledgeable. On my first visit I kind of tested him by asking a few difficult questions. His answers were beyond my expectations. I have no reservations about trusting him to make wise decisions.
1	I have been with him for many years and he has always looked out for me. He was instrumental in diagnosing a serious condition that  when corrected completely changed my life. He also makes sure I understand what he says and follows up. I feel lucky to have him as my doctor.
-1	I think i trust the physicians to do their job to the best of their ability. Sometimes, i think that there are areas that are too specialized and then i seek out more information. 
-1	She is a fine doctor, but very busy and does not seem to spend the time necessary to think through all of the options or which option is most likely - she picks something that might be an answer and we move forward.  It's OK, I trust that she is being honest, but I don't trust that she has the right answer.
1	my primary care physician seems like a believable type of person that could provide me with the accurate info that I need to know about my health
1	I generally am in good health, but that's partly due to having some knowledge of nutrition as well as a working understanding of well-being. Accordingly, I can tell when a doctor is bullshitting me but I find that they generally don't.
-1	He has a lot of medical knowledge, and he cares a lot about his patients.  Most recently I went into see him to get a small internal bump in my inner thigh examined.  After he gave me a physical examination, he determined that it was not cancerous and posed little risk as he thought it was a cyst.  He gave me multiple options:  do nothing, an ultrasound, or surgical removal.  The fact that he gave me multiple treatment options shows me that he cares about my needs, and I am grateful that he puts a lot of the care decisions in the patients' hands while taking to explain the pros/cons of different treatment options.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she will explain all options to me and also make sure that she understands who I am as her patient. She also makes sure that her staff is also aware of who I am as a patient. 
1	I am lucky to live in an area where I have access to qualified medical care. My medical conditions are complex; I need to be able to trust my doctors. If I have any doubt, I move on. Otherwise, I am just wasting my time and theirs.
-1	"My doctor has made huge mistakes on forms like making me get shots for school he thought were required when the form actually said I was excluded. He also signed below the signature line which was odd. He says contradicting things like ""inside your ears it looks PERFECT"" than says I""m suffering from inner ear inflammation. "
1	Whenever I've gone to see him for an issue he is able to help me. He prescribes medicine that works for me and if I need to follow up with him he tells me so.  He's thorough and I feel confident that he cares.
-1	I do not totally depend on my physician to always know what is best for me.  I take his diagnosis seriously, but will tailor the course of treatment to better suit my needs if necessary.
1	My primary doctor is easy to communicate with, she provides easy to understand responses and is thorough.  She is part of a larger medical system that provides excellent care.  She works well with other doctors/staff from the larger system.  I can count on her.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. The only bad thing is I feel rushed. Which also makes me feel like she doesn't care. But she does try to find me help through other doctors or whatever is wrong with me. She does ask me questions that I don't even think to ask her. She seems to want to cure me quickly .
1	I really trust my care physician because they have the knowledge and experience  to knowhow to take care of you
1	I trust the doctor because has has a long career and has been through many experiences in his practice.  He has not been sued for malpractice and he is still in business. In our relationship, he has not led me wrong and has always given helpful advise.
-1	I have little trust in doctors because in me experience, they have been very money orientated. They schedule more and more appointments, not because they care about you, but how much your insurance will pay them for each visit.
1	I have been going to this Doctor since I was a young boy and he has taken amazingly good care of me and my family.  He is also a member of my church and we know his family.  He has fully earned my trust and respect.
1	I feel my doctor explains his decisions fully and gives me the opportunity to take part in the process. I feel he is intelligent and I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	i trust my doctors to a certain extent but you cannot trust anyone completely. i dont have any specific complaints about my current doctors. 
1	I'm trust in my doctor because I know him since I'm a child and every time that he told me something is right he is someone with sense of kind and he is helpful and he care about his patience, He can make mistake like everyone because is human but I trust completely in him.
1	sometime they give false information and don't know what is going on with you or give the correct answer to you
-1	Well they are in the buisness of making money my health to me is not that important to them because if they could tell me everything to do to stay well then i would not need them
-1	I don't trust or distrust them I'm not to sure what or how to feel about doctors. I do not like going to the hospital when I go I just get it over with 
-1	My doctor seems knowledgeable and has gained my trust over the years. My doctor is personable and likeable. I've also verified a lot of his/her comments using the internet, books and other personal research.
1	I feel that they know what they are doing and really listen to my input and take that into consideration.
1	My primary care doctor is honest with me and we create goals together. These goals are used to create feasible objectives and 'Small steps' to work on. 
1	We are very direct with each other. He doesn't  beat around the bush and makes suggestions and recommendations. I make the decisions, with his input. He doesn't always agree, but hey, I pay him, he don't pay me. He is not my boss. 
1	Doctors in general, I feel, are usually professional and honest and I would trust them in diagnosing whatever issue I'm having.
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for a long time.  she always gives me good and trust advise
-1	I don't like spending money to see a doctor when I am not sick. I avoid hospitals at all costs because of the associated costs. I won't see a doctor unless I'm really sick/in immense pain.
1	My physician is always very transparent with me. She always asks if I have any questions, and she always answers them so that I understand. She never seems in a hurry, and she is always very friendly.
1	I have had my primary care doctor for about 25 years now, so I trust her completely. She is always upfront and honest with me all the time. 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part. There are a few occasions when I do more research because I feel like the doctor is not telling me everything or that he doesn't have my best interest. When it comes down to it, I trust him more than often.
1	I have had my physicial for many years and she is always receptive and explains everything to me in depth. I feel that I could reach out to her whenever needed.
-1	"I have little trust in anyone. When I ""trust"" it is because I believe it is possible for there to be a better nature of a situation and person, but I believe for the most part people are liars, or truth benders, or they just don't say everything they should, even if they don't lie. It is complicated. All I know is that I do not fully trust anyone, well... I kinda... it is complicated. Anytime I fully opened up to someone and let my guard down they crushed me. So, I keep my guard up always, and trust so litle I barely trust myself, but I try to trust medical professionals as much as I can, I am getting better at it."
1	I like her because she presents all options and treatments and pros and cons without biasing me towards them and she is open to conventional and non conventional treatments
-1	My primary care doctor usually takes all the time I need to understand what is going on with me and to answer any questions I have.
-1	Primary care physicians literally couldn't care less about what you have to say or the symptoms you have. They only care about the blood work. They want you in and out as fast as possible. Primary care physicians live to get off at 5. 
-1	I don't fully trust my primary doctor because of a bad circumstance we been through before where I went to him with some issues I was having and he kept brushing me off for a year. In the end it was something serious.
1	He is the best in his field! He's very caring and has a great bedside manner. He's open and honest with me. He talks through things with me and I can page him when/if I need him. 
-1	Sometimes my doctor give medicine in cases that are unnecessary and set up for appointment after appointment for no reason.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are real with me.  They dont lie and beat around the bush.  They are really nice understanding and knowledgeable.
-1	I trust my physician in part but there are things that I think he could miss. Also I like my doctor but he is only human.
-1	he takes the time to listen and explore options with me. he listens thoroughly and consults when necessary
-1	I don't always trust what the doctors are telling me because sometimes I feel as though they are just trying to get you in and out as quick as possible
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing her for a long time and am comfortable with her. I can be completely honest with her and 
-1	I've only seen my doctor once for a physical and she seemed a little dismissive of my concerns. I was told by a different doctor I may have a condition that requires a simple blood test but she stated that it was unnecessary and ignored my symptoms. 
1	I generally trust doctors, their abilities, and intentions. My only source of distrust would come from them seeming too busy or distracted and making mistakes.
1	My doctor hasn't given a reason for mistrust. We have never had I had situation Or experience.The lack of trust I have is the normal should I think about again kind.
1	I trust my doctor because he has been around for many years and has the experience in treating pretty much everything. 
1	Good communication is a must with your doctor. Mine is a very relaxed and sincere man.  He gives me his attention and takes his time to make sure everything is clear and that I have no questions.  He explains everything fully and has a game plan for how to proceed forward, and I love that about him.
-1	Not always the case for your on good  to make you better in the long run it so much better life.....
1	I've never had her judge me and she's very thorough in explaining why she things this medicine or htis procedure should be done and won't do anything unless I absolutely understand what is going on.
-1	I have a terrific pcp and I feel it's so easy to talk to her. I am also very strong about what is right for me, so as much as I trust her I make my own decisions.
1	I went through a few doctors before my current doctor. So I have a lot of confidence in both my doctors, I have to see a neurologist and my primary doctor.  The first neurologist actually admitted to me that she didn't know much about my condition so therefore I had no confidence in her at all.
-1	I usually go to the poor clinic and the doctors there are terrible. The one I saw the most was checking information on his phone to make sure he knew what to do with me. I had no trust in his judgment I got better by checking Internet and finding a cure myself.
-1	I don't have a primary doctor but I do feel that most doctors that I have dealt with of very trustworthy. I haven't had any issues of being mislead of being misinformed over any medical situation. Most doctors I have dealt with seem sincere and show concern. 
1	I trust my doctor to what is the right thing to do for me. He has treated me for so long and never done anything to misuse his trust. I feel confident he will make the best decisions for me and my long term health care. 
-1	I sometimes trust doctors depending on what the situation is. I feel like they tend to tell you what they want you to do and not the entire story so you go along with their opinions.
-1	I trust most of what my doctor says unless I detect that she is in a rush to get me out of there. I always do my own research to learn different options and to learn about meds before I take them.
1	he is a good man. he is always there for me when i need him even when he is occupied by patients. n/a
-1	the doctor i have no is really not a big help. it seems like he is only in it for the number of patients he can handle in a day. he often has senior citizens so its hard for to relate to the mid age group. he has gotten so much botox that his face is tight looking like something off of tv i call him a rockstar. i feel like he doesnt really care and this is one of the reasons why i am going to be finding me a new doctor this year so i hope it will be soon
-1	I do feel that they are usually trained to give certain responses. I wish that doctors would take a more holistic approach and give nutritiol support options along with conventiol medicine, and give the patient the option to choose both. 
1	I was taught to trust doctors and those in authority.  Even though I may have questions regarding what they are prescribing or telling me what to do, I still do have some skepticism.  Doctors often work with pharmaceutical companies and I wonder if the drugs they suggest are actually good for me or good for their profession and their bottom line (AKA money).  
-1	ive been seeing my dr since i was 11, 20 years now. she knows me in and out (no pun intended) and i know she has my best interests at heart. she also listens to my opinions and respects when i disagree.
1	I trust my doctor to know what is best for my health all the time but sometimes i feel that I know my body better and can sometimes make a better decision than the doctor in some occassions.
1	I have had the same primary care dr for 30 years. His background is much like mine and he is excellent.i trust him implicitly.
-1	I don't really trust my doctor or really distrust him in any way. I feel that he does provide adequate information but he can be vague and that can be very annoying to deal with. 
-1	He always seems busy and I have had him misdiagnose something to where I had to return for a follow up and  different treatment due to him not spending the time initially.  I am currently searching for a new DR. 
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. However, I've only been seeing this particular doctor for 5 months. I think doctors, for the most part, intend and try to do the best for their patients. I also think that sometimes, other things, like scheduling, unforeseen emergencies and whatever get in the way. When these things happen, doctors just do what they can and maybe don't spend as much time with their patients as they should. 
-1	"I have a hard time completely trusting him because sometimes it seems like he just doesn't really care. It seems like he's too willing to write off problems that I'm concerned about as ""probably nothing"". This has happened before with health issues that I ended up seeing other doctors/specialists for (even though he was very reluctant to refer me as he didn't think the issues were real/serious), only to have those specialists confirm that an actual treatable problem existed. He also misdiagnosed me once by saying I probably had bipolar disorder and sending me to a psychiatrist without doing any sort of physical exam or lab testing. I spent two years heavily medicated and miserable before a different doctor realized that the root of my problem was physical/hormol and started to treat me for it. And then all my mental symptoms went away. But he's one of the few doctors in my area who take my insurance, so I don't really have the option to have a different primary doctor. And he does know more than I do, obviously, since he went to medical school. It just seems like he's stretched way too thin and misses a lot of stuff."
-1	I think sometimes doctors just want to make appointments and prescribe medication in order to make money.
-1	i trust them but im skeptical bevause they are sometimes rough and rude and they make themselves out to be not trusted
1	if you cant trust you doctor who can you trust i trust him because he took an oath and is in the service buseiness the buseinss of caring adn heping
-1	I trust my doctor (cardiologist) very much. He has a great reputation and has a great amount of skill and knowledge.
1	My doctor has far more knowledge about medical conditions and treatments than I do. He seems to genuinely be interested in recommending the best solutions for my health needs. For these reasons I have to trust him.
-1	Most doctors listen to patient concerns.  
-1	i trust my doctor in y health care because he or she she know what they are doing that is all i have to say
-1	To rushed with dealing with too many other clients every day of their lives also tyhey do not really carte since they all drive BMW;s every day..
-1	I trust my doctor very much, I am just also the type of person who likes to do my own research before proceeding with any treatment plans. 
1	I trust my dr with my primary care and trust him in my medical decisions because he is a honest and trustworthy dr. I wouldn't want another dr
-1	It isn't so much that i distrust my Dr. the individual, but rather i distrust the system. The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM. 
1	My Dr is a 38 year old female and she's the best Dr I've ever gone to. She is friendly, caring very easy to talk to, has admitted to me that she didn't go into medicine for the money but wanted to help people. I have complete trust in her.
1	I have known my physician for a while and sge does a good job of making me comfortable and answering my questions.
-1	I like my doctor, but his clinic is so busy that I sometimes get the feeling that he goes with the easiest explanation of something. It makes me willing to spend a bit more money to go to a clinic that I know isn't busy if needed.
1	My doctor is open, funny, and easy to approach.  I enjoy my doctor and don't feel nervous asking my doctor questions pertaining to my health.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes time to listen to my problems and examines me thoroughly. He is also smart and empathetic.
1	I have been going to him for a while and he is great.  He actually listens to you and you can tell he really cares
1	I went to my doctor at a very critical time in my mental health and he understood that it was able to address my needs
1	My doctor seems professional; I have no reason to distrust their advice given to me with regards to my health. Every step they've taken when I've been unwell has made a lot of sense and ultimately helped me.
-1	"I trust my primary care physician for the following reasons: She is always attentive and shows interest in my line of questioning when it comes to description of symptoms, inquiries with regards to preventative maintenance (i.e. discussing future concerns based on age, family history as it relates to my current health, etc.). I never feel rushed during a routine visit when it comes to discussing concerns and overall health strategies. Overall, I feel that she cares about my well-being. My main distrust point with my primary care physician is the ""physical"" side of routine examinations. I feel like she is less comprehensive during the exam than my prior physician with regards to tests and covering all aspects of the exam. This is an additional concern now that I am older and more susceptible to common problems (e.g. enlarged prostate, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)."
1	I have spent a lot of time over the years finding a woman's doctor oh finally on the third doctor in about six years I found a doctor that I really like. I trust her a lot and I believe that she gives me her honest opinion on things,  she will leave and go out of her way to tell me practices that used to be performed which are as widely practiced anymore. Myother main doctor is for my sleep condition. I've been going to see him for over year and I trust his guidance as well. 
-1	"Primary care physicians usually are very straight forward with the facts and available treatments, but most are in and out types. Diagnosing the problem quickly without digging very deep into the situation, giving the usual treatment that has worked well for ""most others"" and not thinking whether or not the treatment would be best for you. "
-1	I don't trust doctors in general because they are not there to truly help you but rather to sell you medicine and procedures which simply hide the problem and not fully address it which ultimately results in the worsening of my health. 
-1	I trust my doctor. He knows much more than i do. Always explains everything, even if i don't ask. I don't think he cares more about what is convenient  for him
-1	I have to go to a clinic for my primary care and the doctors are always changing.I think they are limited in what they can do for me.Some are more helpful than others but I generally trust them.
-1	For the most part, she isn't like most doctors. There have been a few times where we didn't agree on certain treatments, but in the end, we birth found something that was helpful to the both of us 
-1	I do generally trust my doctor, but I know there's a lot he doesn't know, and the same goes for most doctors. So I always supplement whatever information/recommendations he gives me with additional research to get a bigger picture. Doctors generally overprescribe medication, which usually has side effects and can do more harm than good in the long run, so I want to know exactly what I'll get into if I make a certain choice.
1	My doctor is always patient and thorough with me. He makes sure to answer all my questions, as well as ask me how I am
-1	I do have trust in my PCP - as he is intelligent and qualified, but he runs a busy office and I often times feel as though he rushed through the process or appointment. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician moderately. I have so many health issues on going it is hard for her to keep up with what is going on. I went to have knee replacement surgery in February. Ended up having my ankle fused instead. Apparently I was walking on a broken foot and ankle for over a year. It was aggravating my knee issues. 
1	My doctor is very knowledgeable and helpful. She explains everything that i need to know about my lab work and my exams. I feel that I can talk to her and she listens.
-1	I have been going to my primary care dotor now for 17 years.  I feel that he has my best interest at heart.
1	If she does not know the solution to my problem she will refer me to someone who is an expert in that field.
1	I feel like my doctor went through a lot of education and training to get to where he is now, so I feel like he probably has a pretty good understanding of my health and how to treat and maintain it
1	I feel a primary care physician or doctor is trained and highly skilled in their area of expertise. I respect this, although I am cautious and will consult a second opinion if I think it is needed.
-1	I do not have a strong amount of trust in any doctor. Doctors often lie or leave out information pertaining to medical information, in order to make their money. For example, doctors are aware of how dangerous kemo and radiation are, but they continue to sale it to patients. 
1	"My internist is always honest with me about any tests or diagnoses he provides.  He tells me options with meds, testing, surgeries, etc, then gives me the choice of how to proceed.  He never ""talks down"" to me, and explains thoroughly. He keeps good track of my health, immunizations, mental health, medications and tests.  He follows up with me after most visits to see how I'm doing."
-1	They try to rush during a visit and get to the next patient as soon as possible.
-1	I trust her.  I just want to look over anything she prescribes to me
-1	Doctors in general seem to want to prescribe the most efficient treatment possible in my opinion. I've only ever had one experience where I felt like the doctor was rushing me along or not really listening to any concerns I had.
-1	I distrust my doctor because they have to google the answers to my questions when I come in to see them with questions. I currently have Medi-Cal and the selection of doctors that accept Medi-Cal are limited. After I finish school and have health insurance, I would definitely do research to switch my primary care physician to someone I trust more. The doctors at the office have a cosmetic focus as well as primary care, so when I had asked for a referral to see a dermatologist, I was not given one. Though the doctor did not push me to get cosmetic treatment, I feel like referrals to dermatologists would hurt their business.
-1	I havent felt that my doctor has ever misled me in the past, nor given me bad advice. Whatever I went into the doctors for, eventually was healed or cured. 
-1	I trust my PC because she listens to me and what I am trying to accomplish. She hears me and allows me to have a say in if I want to take medicine, approach things a certain way. She cares. 
-1	I have seen different doctors throughout my life for regular healthcare visits. These have typically been older physicians. I trust their experience and judgement from having practiced medicine for many years. I haven't always agreed with everything they've mentioned but I believe they recommend what they do to the best of their abilities and due to trying to err on the side of caution.
1	I have doctors that I trust to give me good services and provide ideals to help keep me healthy and to live a good and longer life every time I see them.
1	My primary care physician has been the same since I was born so I have a lot of trust in them. They actually care about my family and myself and what is best for us.
-1	I would have to say more than anything I feel a doctor is there to rush me in and out. I don't go very often but I never feel like I'm truly heard. I wait for 30-45 minutes for 5 minutes with them saying exactly what I have already told them and them prescribing something. I feel like I should be able to see a doctor nearly instantly for a cold, flu, or something common so I can be in and out and not waste my time.
-1	They sometimes just give pills to cure a situation without getting to the root of the cause.  They don't have time to discuss a plan that would work for me instead of pills.
1	My doctor has been my physician for over 30 years and he has always been very upfront and honest with his medical decisions 
-1	I feel neutral about them because sometimes I feel like they are just telling me the most common solution to my problem instead of thinking outside the box.  Sometimes I feel like they make excuses so they don't have to really think in depth about what could be wrong with me.  
1	I have been seeing my pcp for the last 20 years.  he is kind, thoughtful, and smart.  He sees his patients as people, and has a full understanding of their needs.  He is an amazing doctor who has actual conversations with his patients.
-1	My primary care doctor has changed 3 times in the last year.  I totally trust my gynecologist and cardiologist.  Sometimes doctors want to charge insurance companies for additional testing.  Sometimes they don't want to tell you that you should maybe see a different specialist.
-1	I have been going to my primary care care phycisian for many years. He has helped my husband and I through several problems. I had one problem that he could not solve and he kept sending me to different specialists. After 3 years finally found the one in Dallas that immediately knew what my problem was. After open heart surgery he found a problem my husband had that the heart surgeon and heart doctor had missed. So yes I completely trust my family doctor. 
1	Some would say that medical professiols can't be trusted most of the time because there are times that they will just neglect your opinion and ask you to follow their opinion for their own benefits.Yes, it is true in some instance.However, those behaviors depending on the person you are in contact with.People now in our society has different attitudes and point of view in life and what is important is we must be cautious.
-1	Don't have primary care physician but don't completely trust doctors because if patients get well doctors out of business.  Also push too many pills.
-1	I trusted my doctor til she turned me over to a nurse practioner in her practice.  I am not confident with the abilities of the nurse practioner although I do like her as a person.  She seems very kind and sweet.
1	I have had the same doctor for 30 years and he is like an extended family member, I feel he cares for me and will always suggest what he feels is the best treatment for me, he is very professional with an excellent bedside manner.
1	I was diagnosed with breast cancer 17 years ago.  I followed my doctors suggestions regarding treatment & medication and am cancer free and have been for quite a while.  The doctor discussed and explained every in great detail
-1	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mine, but sometimes I do not agree with their treatment ideas. I had a doctor make me get an endoscopy for abdominal pain. It was quite an invasive test that was useless as it did not show the cause of my abdominal pain. I went to another doctor who ordered a non invasive abdominal ultrasound which showed gallstones. I had to suffer and take it upon myself to get the care I needed.
1	I have never had a problem with any medical advice he has given me.He has always listened to what I have to say and answers any questions I have.
1	I trust my doctor. He is kind and caring. He takes plenty of time to listen to my concerns and responds appropriately.
-1	I trust that my primary care physician will provide me with the accurate info regarding my well being in regards with what's diagnosed.
-1	Itâs not that I feel that doctors are intentionally wrong or misleading. In most cases Iâm sure they arenât. But medicine in general is so nuanced that Iâve found when I visit a dr for something I gain little to no actual help or improvements and often just end up trying their advice to little help. I feel like Iâm playing dr roulette every visit. Usually I just end up with a bill and no new help or information and often also have to get referred to another dr cause drâs are so specialized nowadays that you canât just visit one dr for most things. So that just increases my bills, wares my time and creates stress. 
1	I trust my doctor because she has always listened to my issues and questions.  She always gets back to me with an answer if I happen to email or call her.  I have always felt safe and well taken care of and I never worry about her not getting back to me.  She really cares about me and my well-being and it shows in her interactions with me.
1	I trust my doctor, but not completely. I do not, as a rule, trust Doctors in general. They all seem to start out good people, but most of them become greedy, and want to fix everything with pills. There is more to fixing someone than just pills.There is a job to do, most Doctors are not doing it properly.
-1	I currently do not have a primary care physician, but the one that I previously had did not seem to care that much about me or understand how I was feeling. I distrusted her, because she didn't take much time to listen to what I had to say about my thyroid, symptoms, and she didn't act like she wanted to help me. I felt like my previous primary care physician treated me more like a number, rather than a patient.
-1	My primary care physician asks questions that implies they're trying to dig deeper into my symptoms to see what is wrong. They run tests that may help figure out what's wrong with me.
-1	For the most part I trust that my doctor has my best interest in mind.  But I also know that I am one of many patients for him.  He is often following the protocols that he has to follow and does not know me as well as I know myself.
-1	doctors dont seem to care like they used to.  They rush thru the appts just to make that money.  They dont listen nor do they act like they care about what you are saying.  
-1	They are sincere and experienced, but would like to make a lot of money with my visits, which I do understand but most of the time the outcome is generated office visits.
-1	I usually trust my physician because they have no reason to lie to me.  They go based off of current medical information.  Sometimes I get frustrated when I know I need an antibiotic to help me but they refuse or dance around the issue.
-1	I've been with my doctor from multiple years now and I feel very comfortable with our relationship and his prescriptions.
-1	I don't trust doctors because when I had my son they gave me to much blood pressure meds, which cause my blood pressure to drop uncomtrolably with out stoping so much to the point where I need oxygen 
-1	I have no problem with the Dr's analysis of my problems. I'm on the same medications and everything is going well
-1	I have not had very good luck with doctors and have been sent miles away to get care or have had to see multiple providers
-1	She spends more than 5 minutes during appts and seems to listen when I have problems or issues that need addresses
-1	This is more about the doctor I see most often which is my gastroenterologist, he always seems to be pushing me to non-generic drugs even though I like the way my body reacts to what I am currently taking.  I also feel he pushed me into an endoscopy I did not at all need, just to get another year supply of a drug I depend on.  All in all that cost me $2500 out of pocket that I couldn't afford at the time. 
1	I have never had a reason to doubt my primary care physician, I trust her completely she has always been right about my conditions and also told me to get a second opinion if needed.
1	I trust my physician because she genuinely cares about what is best for me and she always advises me to take extra precautions just in case because you can never be too careful.
-1	While I believe doctors are a trustworthy lot, in general, I am also aware that doctors see many patients per day and treatment options are constantly changing. Doctors may not be fully aware of the latest developments in medicine. Recently published studies showing adverse reactions to conventional treatments may not be foremost in a doctors mind while treating her patients.
1	Because he understand me and knows that I have background I healthcare also and we work together to find the problem
1	Our primary care physician goes out of her way to make our visit worthwhile and listens, answers questions throughly and honestly.
-1	I have self diagnosed before I go to the dr. and had to push for the dr to ask for a test . That was contrary to his diagnosis. He then did the test and I was  correct. It was very frustrating !
-1	My physician has helped me in positive ways thus far, but I never like to put my complete trust in anyone because you just never know. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him my entire adolescent and young adult life. I have fallen ill beyond a point where I could recover without assistance from a medical professional and when I went to my doctor for consultation, I felt like I was in knowledgable and caring hands. Furthermore, my parents have faith and put trust in my doctor and I know my parents want what is best for me and my own health, that is why I would trust my primary care physician even more. 
-1	A primary care physician is a physician who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis. Since recently, the term is primarily used in the United States. In the past in the US and still in the United Kingdom (and in many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is general practitioner.
-1	I do not know my primary care doctor that well. I see him 1-2 times per year. He is very smart and knows what he is talking about, but that's not how I build trust with people.
1	Most of the doctors I have been in contact with recently seemed to have my best care in mind. I recently hurt my shoulder and needed to go to the Orthopedic Surgeon for car. While I had not been to this Ortho before, he was very thorough and explained the cost/benefits of the treatment plan he had set for me. However, I find that interacting with other medical staff, such as psychiatrists, RNs, LPNs, that they are much more business-oriented, in and out. For those types of specialists/general staff I do not have as much trust as I do my PCP or Ortho.
1	My primary care physician is kind and answers any questions that I may have. He is also very careful and mostly remembers when I last visit him. I think he cares a lot about his patients.
-1	I have to rely on my primary care physician, because I I don't have any other options to get medical advice. I am distrustful of him on some level, because he is driven by his business interest first very often.
1	I trust my physician because he has always been good to me and given me accuracy and professiolism.
1	I trust my primary care physician very much so, with every thing I go to seek help for. He/she is trust worthy, gives me the care and knowledge and need to know information when it comes to my health.
1	I haven't experienced a doctor who didn't prioritizes my needs. I know there are doctors that aren't completely honest and are only interested in their pay check, but I don't believe I've ever met one.
-1	HE LISTENS TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING MY TYPE 2 DIABETES OR OTHER CONDITION I MAY HAVE.  IF I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING HE SAYS HE TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER THEM RATHER THAN PUTTING ME OFF WITH A HALF ASSED ANSWER BUT RATHER GIVES A THOUGHTFUL ANSWER IN TERMS I CAN UNDERSTAND RATHER THEN SAYING THINGS I NEED A MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTAND.  THIS GOES FOR MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MY UROLOGIST AND MY ENDOCRONOLOGIST 
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. Though, he is a person just like others with flaws.
-1	I trust my family doctor greatly. I've been using him since I was a teenager. I never had a problem with him.
-1	I feel like I can trust my doctor to listen to me and answer my questions correctly.  However, if I forget something or don't ask the question correctly I fell like things have or will be missed.  This has happened.  I do so much of my own research before appointments I try and make sure that I pretty much already know the answers and he just confirms or corrects.
-1	Sometimes I feel they are only in it for the money. I feel they might order something that I do not need done or some other added expense for no reason. Usually this is not the case and they are usually out for my best interest but I feel they sneak a few things in there. I can usually trust my provider to get me the help that I need and that they are being honest with me and careful to treat me right. 
1	Doctor are suppose to take care of their patients as if they were their children, and try to help them as much as they can, I would want a Doctor to do all he can to help me get better and not have to keep coming back for the same problem over and over.
1	While I have been lucky to have great doctors whom I trust, and I trust my current doctors, I would say that I do not necessarily trust doctors in general. This is because I understand that doctors are less likely to take women's reported symptoms seriously, medications that may be prescribed are tested much less thoroughly on women than on men, and especially in obstetrics women are not given important information to monitor their own health during/after childbirth which leads to the US having an incredibly high maternal death rate for a first-world country. If I were a man, I would trust medical practices a great deal more. 
-1	I don't she would tell you just anything for money. Alot of Dr's have had problems for just giving any information. She was highly recommended , so I think she gives good information. She explains everything . Her assistant is very thorough too. They are up to-date on new medications and procedures. She hasn't given a reason for distrust.
-1	my doctor has given me no reasons to doubt his thoroughness and ability to treat me.  I trust he gives me good advice and wants me to be as healthy as possible
1	In the past, I have not trusted my physicians. I felt they did not take the time to follow through with care.  My current doctor is thorough and seems to care to exhaust all possible ways to figure out to make me feel better and also seems to notice how a patient feels at the time of the visit
1	She takes times to be thorough ad suggest what I need. Always have confidencein what she does even though sometimes it is not something I want to do.
-1	I do trust my health care provider enough to hear their advice and opinions, but i truly like to do some added research based off the doctors suggestions to feel more secure in my choice/decision 
1	I trust my doctor to evaluate me and to be honest with me. He is very good at referring me to other good doctors and I trust him to do this.
-1	My doctors give me the facts. He or she does not sugarcoat my diagnosis. That makes me trust them.
1	He's been my doctor for years. Whenever something is wrong, we can general figure out a fix. If there's ever problem we can't work through together, he sends me to a specialist.
1	Generally, I feel they have little reason to be dishonest or disingenuous, compared to the large incentive they have to be truthful and helpful.
-1	I do not even have a primary care physician. I have not seen a doctor in years. I am in good health and do not need to visit a physician for any problems. 
-1	Its not that I don't trust in what they're saying to me, I just have to realize that they may not always be right, and with a serious diagnosis I would definitly seek a second opinion and move from there
-1	dont see them that often but when i see them they are ok they are close by which is convenient thats all i have to say
-1	i do not know her very well yet
-1	I do not fully trust my doctor because it's just hard for me to do. I like to do my own research and find tural homeopathic ways of doing things.
1	I've been with my Doctor now for almost a decade and I've had little or no reason not to trust he has my best interests at heart. He only prescribes drugs when I really need them and gives me more than one option for treatment with full information.
-1	Thus far the recommendations of my Dr.(s) have been a positive and appropriate. I had a condition a few years ago and my OB-GYN recommended I start a daily medication. I don't like to take medications if I can avoid it but after following his advise my health improved and I have not had any problems with this condition in 2 years. 
1	My doctor has my best interests at heart.  On more than one occasion, she has gone above and beyond what would be expected.
-1	You should never trust anyone completely. That is just being lazy, and letting someone else do the thinking for you. You should always put some effort in to evaluating things that other people say/do, regardless of how much you trust them.
1	I trust my doctor because he hasn't really given me a reason not to. He's very receptive to what I think is wrong with me and is very thorough in explaining what I am suffering from. He also explains his choices as to how to treat and explains why my initial thought of my reason for coming is wrong without being condescending.
-1	I think that for the most part, my doctor will recommend what is best for me. However, there are times when the office is very busy. At those times, I do not always feel as though my doctor is fully listening and may be in too much of a hurry for me to feel confident in his recommendations.
-1	I believe doctors are generally there to help you, not hurt or deceive you. They are looking to make you feel better as that is my most people go into the medical field.
-1	There are some doctors that will go out of there way to help a patient and then there are some that are of no help at all. I have encountered both in my lifetime especially when it comes to dealing with my children's health issues. 
-1	I do not necessarily distrust my physician I simply don't completely trust anyone. I value my doctors opinions and suggestions greatly but ultimately I make my own decisions. 
1	My doctor is a straight-forward guy.  I believe that he tells me like it is.  I know that he's very good at his job.  I have confidence in him.
-1	I trust my doctor, but I understand that she has pressures and influences that may not lead to the best care for me. I believe a patient must take an active part in their own care if possible.
-1	I've had family members with doctors who have rushed them thru things, misdiagnosed or allowed very serious illnesses to remain undiagnosed, and not been careful enough in prescribing and monitoring the effect of medications. There are good doctors but I think in the US nowadays if you want to be assured you're getting the best care possible from your physician then you must be vigilant and persistent. I would be wary of any doctor even tho I know most don't mean to cause harm.
-1	because i have been through a lot with mines and it has always been good not much to complain about when it comes to this
-1	Although I don't doubt that my primary care physician cares about me, I also believe that they are not my best friend. I try my best to listen to what they tell me but I also research the information I'm given on my own and find out what the best course of action is.
-1	My doctor is always pleasant and seems to be treating me fairly. We have not had any issues. I came from a primary care doctor that I did not have any trust for, so this seems like a huge improvement to me. 
1	I trust my doctor to give me the best treatment options. That the doctor's job after all, to help me feel better. 
1	I like my doctor, we have a private practice doctor, so I feel we get lucky and get extra time he doesn't seem to rush me and I feel he listens to me when I go in to see him.  I also like that I see only him, so he can look back from last time he saw me or review his notes, that gives me confidence that something won't be missed
-1	I know next to nothing in the medical field and I see no reason why my doctor would not be interested in me regaining my full health. Hence, I see not reason not to trust them. My trust is not complete because they are still humans and can still make mistakes.
1	I trust my doctor because he has yet to give me any false or misleading information. He spends time talking to me and doesn't rush me out of the door. Listens to my concerns/questions and answers them well
-1	I some times dont trust doctors as they have become commercial now a days and sometimes they are selfish about their own growth financially irrespective of the patient's health. sometimes i do trust my doctor's decision but sometimes m doubtfull but dunno why but no doctor is more careful about my medical needs than his own.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is never in a hurry to get to her next patient.  She makes sure you fully understand all of your options 
-1	I've known too many doctors to do things in a rush. I wish they would of sat and had  a conversation with me, instead of telling me what needed to be done, cause some things aren't actually necessary. 
-1	I trust my doctor mostly because I haven't had any serious health issues but if that day was to come I'm not 100 percent confident in my doctor but I am confident enough to trust their opiniuand do what they say.
1	Mainly because I do not really need my doctor to explain to me what is going on. I can see that he gives instructions and recommendation based on current research and best practices by verifying it for myself. Unless you do this you allow yourself to be treated like an object instead of a sentient being. It is vital that a person educate him/herself outside of the doctor's office.
1	I recently changed physicians to a female doctor and feel that she understands me better than the male doctor. I feel I can trust what she says and like her communication style. 
-1	They are human and they make mistakes as well. They are not always right about everything.  Sometimes they don't know and they are guessing about your diagnosis.
1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because he takes the time to listen to my questions and the information that I share regarding how I am feeling.  He is very concerned and elicits my input when attempting to understand my health concers.
1	I trust my primary care physician's knowledge, in that has been able to direct me in the right path of medical care for several years. She has directed me to specialists whom I have found to be great doctors. She is very knowledgeable--a specialist, in fact--in the area of breast cancer, which is of special concern to me because of my family history. She takes plenty of time to ask and answer questions at each visit.
-1	Doctors want money and they often push information they are being paid for, like from pharmaceutical companies and whatnot. I really don't know if my doctor knows what is best for me because of all the alternative medications and practices I can read about online. I don't put too much into what my doctor says as they have limited information from their medical school studies.
1	Because he is experienced at his profession and also he knows what he is doing and also he knows how to treat his patients 
1	My doctor has always helped me in any medical decisions I may have to make. I trust my doctor and she helps me in anyway she can
-1	Waiting around for an hour and more in order to talk with a guy for a few minutes annoys me.  I know they're busy, but I hate feeling rushed.  I feel like just another patient file/number.
-1	I don't trust many doctors because alot prove to be more after money than helping the patients
1	I trust my doctor because of the wonderful service that she provides me with. She always answers my questions and provides feedback for me regarding my questions.
-1	I trust my physician to a point. The only thing I don't like is getting my blood pressure taken, and then I don't get told immediately what it is. I need to have this information.
1	I think you should trust your physician in the team that he works with because they are there to help you and they care about your conditions your health and your well-being
-1	I feel like my doctor cares, but is also very busy. Sometimes it feels like a whirlwind once she's in the room with me. She always asks if I have any questions before she leaves, but sometimes I feel so caught up in the pace that I can't really think of anything at the time. It's nice that her office has an online portal that I can send in a message and get a response from a nurse after the fact. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing her since I am a child and she always will go the distance to figure out what is wrong with me when it is something more than just a cold. She will order multiple test and blood labs, and always tries to explain all information with me. I am comfortable in talking with her openly and she does the best she can to keep me at ease.
1	My doctor does not dance around subjects and outright tells me what is wrong and how or why I should fix things if they need medical attention. 
-1	I feel like the time spent with me is probably not enough to accurately diagnose and help. I think my doctor has good intentions, and is very knowledgeable, but probably too busy. 
-1	So far my doctor has been good to me. When I see him he gives me good advice and tells me the truth about my situation.
1	My primary care physician always looks for new ways to help with my treatment plan, and so far, everything has worked out very well.
1	I generally trust doctors and believe they have my best interest at heart.
-1	easy to use an great fun helpfor use to remain healthy and useful help and good reviews and helpful
-1	My primary care physician is very easy to talk to and have discussions about any particular problem.  He is almost like a family friend.  We can talk about non-medical things, as well.
-1	I am a retired RN so I know a lot about medicine, I know the kind of questions I need to ask to understand my condition and I realize the physician works for me and I'm not intimidated.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust doctors as I've had the pleasure of witnessing first hand their dishonesty. Doctors are a business and their primary concern is their bottom line rather than the Hippocratic oath. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is kind and competent. They care about me and my health. They are concerned about any issues I have. We have good communication between us as well. She is also very concerned about other parts of my life as well.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I do not have a primary care physician, I trust doctors in general.
-1	I have more than one doctor. Some are more thorough than others while some are less conscious of the fact that I can understand my medical condition better when they fully explain things to me regarding treatment. I trust all of my doctors judgment, but am the kind of patient who likes to do my own homework.
-1	Hes there to make money.  He has his own agenda, and sometimes I feel like he ends up only doing the least amount to help me so I will  have to come in again so he can make more money off of me.
1	I have never had a major medical issue come up for me.  It's always something minor like a cold, sore throat, or something along those lines.  When I have taken my daughter to the doctor it is always for something minor as well.  Our doctors have always given great advice and the right prescriptions for our needs.  I have no reason not to trust them, but I know I  might feel different if I went to the doctor more often.
-1	I don't trust my doctor completely. I had a great doctor but he transferred and I got stuck with this guy. I want to change doctors but I am still trying to give this guy a chance because maybe he will get better with time. I know that he tries on his diagnosis but have found that I have had to go to a urgent care more than once because he doesn't get it right.
-1	i have used the same physician for 20+ years. in the last few years, he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor who i felt was completely incompetent , he has hired a pa that is not  listening to me, is affiliated with a hospital where i spent 3 days in pure hell (incompetence running rampant.), renewed a prescription and then a month later called the pharmacy and cancelled it( it was blood pressure medicine..i can't believe these things are going on in his office without his knowledge..
-1	I believe doctors will just throw pills at issues that I go to them for and would like cures more than pills.
1	I trust my physician because he tells me stories on how he basically knows his stuff and content and it just sounded so convincing that it made me believe he's smart
1	My doctor has taken an oath to provide the best care and help ensure I am healthy. I trust their advice and guidance in terms of my wellness. I have no reason to believe that my doctor is anything but straight forward with me.
1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him
-1	I have never had a reason not to trust my doctors.  I'd rather give them the benefit of the doubt.  
-1	I do not trust m primary care physician, nor do I trust doctors in general. I feel like no doctors really care about their patients, instead they only care about making money in this terrible for profit health care system we have here in the United States. 
-1	being inj good health just doesn't need a lot of advice from a dr. treatments are a few pills a day and i feel fine
1	I've been going to my primary care physician since I was a teeger. I've had some medical issues that he's helped me to resolve over the years. He's had his practice for a long time and has never given me a reason to not trust him or his staff.
-1	i trust her because she always listens to me and helps me out all the time makes sure that i feel safe and any test i want done or need done she does it i like it its nice 
-1	I trust him because he looks out for my well being, and if he prescribes something that I am not comfortable with after reading the side effects of reviews then he recommends or prescribes an alternative form of treatment
-1	They take the time to listen to me and explain what they are doing and thinking. Sometimes they are rushed, but overall, I think they are doing well.  
1	I trust my doctor he is upfront and blunt about things. He doesn't hold back anything. He always answers my questions
-1	I trust my doctor with my medical condition because I hope the know what they are doing and have the knowledge and tools to help me if I have test done or a sickness. If I have doubts or distrust than I will sure to make sure I get a different health provider or doctor
-1	I trust them because I have been going there for a long time and like all of them and know they would do anything for me and my health.
-1	I donât anyone should have complete trust in doctors. Different doctors can offer different opinions. A lot of doctors are also in the pocket of large pharmaceutical companies. 
-1	I've been seeing this PCP for the majority of my life so i trust her judgement on most medical decisions. Sometimes i feel as if though she has a lot on her plate and can't spend more than a few moments reviewing certain pieces of information about my medical history, but overall she touches base on all of my medical concerns. 
-1	I would like to think that doctors have the patients best interest at heart. I would also think that they have seen many cases of certain illnesses and have  lots of experience in dealing with the problem. However, sometimes, I think that a doctor can have ulterior motives but most likely not.
1	Because she talks straight up with me she knows me i trust her judgement she's cool down to earth always there to help answers ur questions
-1	nothing like that i can feel the importance and trust mmyself very easy so am saying that very confidiently that i can do all by myself
1	I trust my doctor because he has never made a bad medical decision, and he listens to my problems ad concerns
1	She always gives it to me straight and never tells me any bull. She tells me what she thinks is wrong and tries to help me understand what is going on with my body. 
-1	My GP listens to me and trusts my intelligence. He knows I don't like to take medication unnecessary medications and that I only call if something is very wrong. He's an amazing diagnostician. 
-1	My doctor is pretty good at being very diligent and listening to me and answering all my questions and exploring all treatment options.
1	I've had the same doctor since I was a kid and in fact, he is my family's doctor. So my mother and even grandmother have a great deal of experience with him. He's willing to talk, answer questions and usually does well. Plus he hasn't killed any of us yet, so that's a great bonus.
-1	i think that doctors do whats best in part for the money. An are more interested in bringing in more patients, as it is why they try to keep people on medicine.
-1	I sometimes feel rushed by my doctor which leads me to wonder if they're being thorough or doing what is convenient to them.
-1	they have always been honest with me and take care of me all i have to do is call them and they will work me in
1	he has been on top of my care and takes the time needed to understand the symptoms and challenges that my condition entails.  Seems up on current practices and thinking inthe medical world.
-1	My PCP just seems to have a diagnosis ready to go before we even speak. He rarely seems to be concerned with side effects I report and love to have tests run. His focus just seems very narrow, he is late and just dismissive. 
1	I've been with the same doctors for over 25yrs I definitely trust them, if there's a situation that needs to be address I am confident that my doctors will inform me and give the guidance to take the appropriate action to address the issue.
-1	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for approximately 7 years now; she gradually earned my trust...Have had a few bad experiences with doctors in the past, and by far, she has been the best to date...
1	I trust my doctor because my doctor have my best intense at heart an will not recommend anything that is bad for me or anything that I will regret in the future 
1	I love my doctor,I recommend everyone to my doctor but it took 4 doctors before I found him,before I found him I hated doctors they did not listen or care what you say my doctor will sit and talk to me for 20 mins he is great and he does not push pills he believes in fixing your self or your diet,he is great.
-1	I honestly don't trust anyone. I believe what they say is helpful but holistic approaches are good too. 
1	I currently have faith in my general practitioner as they are reputable, honest, and straightforward
1	I trust my physician because my friend and my friends mom were her patients. They went to a school i am familiar with . They have always explain everything and provided care for me. 
1	My doctor and I have a very strong friendship as well as doctor/patient relationship. She listens to my opinions and thoughts and we make my health decisions together.
-1	I don't trust or distrust them. They are very busy and medicine is complicated so I'm sure they will make many mistakes.
-1	I think that with any doctor I will have some distrust from their patients, because its a money making business. I think that how much income a doctor generates definitely has an impact on the amount care that the doctor provides. I personally often have these distrusting feelings but I also have no problem asking questions for clarification.  I will object to something that I disagree with and I will go else where for treatment.
-1	I have been pushed around and lied to in the past by doctors. Doctors do not spend enough time getting to know you or your situation before making a diagnosis and are often wrong. Doctors in general are greedy and care more about money than helping people. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician is because their always give me a good advice of how I should take care of myself.
1	My PCP is a very reliable man. He listens to me when I report symptoms and places an importance on my physical and mental health, my overall well-being. He has expressed concern for my health and has instructed me to follow necessary steps to becoming healthier in my everyday life. I appreciate and respect his feedback, and I know that he is looking out for my best interest.
-1	I don't think they know me well enough to possibly know what is best for me personally. I trust that they're giving me recommendations or information that they think is generally best, though.
-1	i don't really go to a doctor often - i wait until i have a problem. I trust them to do what is best for me.
-1	My seemingly distrust for most doctors comes from experiences of people that are close to me. I've seen doctors misdiagnose or treat for wrong illnesses way too often. I've also seen and heard about them prescribing medicine that was unnecessary.
-1	I have always trusted my doctor.  He has been my persol doctor ever since I had my first heart attack.  I can say I do not trust his nurses due to their ruse behavior, but my doctor yes.  He has done persol visits to my home before and has taken good care of my health after my first heart attack experience.  I feel much better now than before. 
1	She is a family friend. She takes the time to check on me as a person and not just what is written on the chart for the reason I am visiting her.  She touches up on multiple aspects of my life as far as family, physical activity, emotional state, and other things that may have an influence on my health.
1	I trust my doctors because they have always been correct on the medication and treatment they have prescribed for me. They take their time and listen to what I have to say.
-1	i trust my doctor because he treats well and gives all the information i need. whether its good or bad. there is an app where all the lab reports are uploaded directly and he has asked me to log in to it so that i dont feel anything is hidden from me
1	the most doctors are very skilled and human, so in this way, all of them are very trustworthy and helpful to their patients, and i have complete and total trust on what they say
-1	I tell my doctor problems and he brushes it off. He does not respect my needs.  He is too cold. I told him about a knot on my foot 6 months ago. He ignored it. Now it is painful and bigger
-1	been with him for a long time and feel confident he is trying to do what's right and look out for my best interest as a doctor.
-1	I have a personal care physician that generally is interested in the problem and is willing to offer suggestions or solutions,  For the most part I simply go to the doctor about every 3 months for her opinion if I need to do anything in particular.
-1	It is true that if he did try to explain all of the different medications to me and what they do, I probably wouldn't understand and the meeting would take too long and cost me more money, but for the same reasons, I can't have complete trust in him because there is so much I do not know.
1	My doctors are very capable about making choice for my medical care. I trust them to make sure that I feel very good about all choice for my medical care. 
-1	For the most part I do trust her, but often she does not let me explain sufficiently and take my feelings into account. There is an old saying among doctors that says, if you want to know what is wrong with a patient, just listen to them.... they can tell you.
1	i have already explained this. my doctor and i have a good relationship. we talk, we discuss. she is open with me about where i am at in my care and listens well.
-1	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I think that medicine can be trendy and when my primary reccomends a procedure or exam that I think is unecessay I usually go with my gut feeling.  I have not taken certain test ie colonostomy for example because I don't believe the risk however so small is worth the possible pay off.  This is a procedure that is now common but I feel unecessary in most cases.
-1	Because i have family in the medical industry i have seen how cold they have become from being a caretaker. they get burned out and tired and start treating like a regular job versus a healing profession. 
-1	I don't have much of a choice - I have to trust him - he's the one with the medical degree.  I generally don't put much faith since medicine used to be a profession and is now a business but there are no alternatives.  it is what it is
1	She listens to my concerns and gives options and realistic goals and expectations. She makes wonderful referrals and explains everything in great detail. 
1	First she is a woman, I trust female doctors over male. She listens and even argues with about taking care of myself.
1	I will only trust them if I have previously dealt with them. It takes a few visits for me to be able to trust in a doctor. I have encountered some that are only in it for the money and do not care about the patients.
1	My doctor has never failed me or my family.  Anytime we have ever gone to her she takes her time to get to the bottoms of what is wrong.  I trust her not only with myself but also my child.
-1	there is a time when go to the doctor for help a second opinion is helpful to make the right choice then the time is right to get started to get the best physician care the medical insurance will cover
1	My doctor always seems to explain and talk about everything that i have any questions over and it's always quick and to the point but they are also somewhat hurried.
1	My doctor is knowledgeable and experienced in treating my condition. He discusses with me what the options are for treating my condition. He answers any questions that I have concerning my condition and my treatment options.
-1	My primary care physician seem to be caring about my health problems.  I do trust her, but sometimes I have to make my own decision about what's best for my own health. 
-1	The doctors are just for a paycheck and they really dont care about their patients.  It is sad that they dont have a caring heart.  I rather go to a doctor who really cares and not looking at you as money in their pocket
-1	A doctor has enough experience and knowledge to give advice. The quality and design of the feature has value.
-1	i trust my doctor he has always been there for me and let me know everything that i need to know and explains it to me so i understand it 
-1	my primary care physician will tell me I need to take a drug instead of offering something natural to help me. I really try to avoid drugs. I don't completly trust that taking drugs is always the best answer
-1	My primary physician is pleasant and listens but I am not sure they always understand what I am telling them.
-1	My doctor takes time to talk with me and answer all my questions. There is also time to discuss all options thoroughly to gain the clearest picture.
1	It is his job to give his patients the best care and treatment. If not, he could be sued, and could potentially lose his license 
1	I trust my doctor because I don't see a reason why I shouldn't. They went through all that studying and school, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be untrustworthy.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always makes me feel better.  He gives me exactly what I need to feel better.  He is a nice guy.  I like him.
-1	Dr's are people like everyone else, and people will always do what is best for them. Maybe they are in a bad mood and want to leave maybe they are getting kickbacks for prescribing a certain drug/treatment. My dr has tried to keep me on a medication that there was no real reason for me to be on, when I pressed her on why she wanted me to take it she could really give me a good reason beyond she said so. 
1	I have had the same doctor for 30 years and though I see him only 1 or 2 times a year I feel he is there when I need him. He has taken good care of me  thru any illness I have had.
-1	I believe physicians or primary care go to school to have the up most education in understanding another human. Sometimes you know your self too much to want to hear what a physician has to say. But its always great to hear the physician out because that its there job to do so. They are there to help the public and anyone in need.
1	education, experience and no obvious profit motive. if I didn't trust my doctor I'd find another. Part of an hmo.
1	I trust my primary physician, I've had the same doctor since I was a child and they're always very thorough. We often spend quite a bit of time when an issue arises to ensure we're taking the proper steps to rectify the situation.  
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel there are things besides good medical practice which afffect the decision making of my doctor. When it comes to treatments, I feel my doctor is influenced by the pharmaceutical industry either directly (through an active relationship) or indirectly (through the funding that is given by those companies to research which then dictates what treatments are available or not).
1	My doctor gives me a lot of options and wieks through creating a plan with me, not just for me. She goes the extra mile and u believe she genuinely cares about my health
-1	She has always been earnest with me about whatever I when to see her about. She has never beat around the bush when it comes to my health.
1	I trust my doctor because he is honest and patient  focused. He also explains different ailments thoroughly and is not quick to write a prescriptions and suggests other methods to control ailments (high blood pressure) before prescribing medications 
-1	I see an endocrinologist every 3 months. I trust him. He is young and seems to be very knowledgeable in my particular health issue. He is not afraid to try new medications to help me and talks in plain English rather than using unfamiliar medical terminology when talking to me. I trust him and he seems to take more time than most at each appt.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for over 20 years, and he knows me very well. He is calm and careful and is able to make better recommendations because he knows about my family, my lifestyle, my history, etc. He stays current with medical literature and developments in healthcare.
1	I have been with my pcp for several years now. He is kind knowledgeable and helpful. He listens to me and I never feel rushed. 
-1	I do trust my PCP.
-1	I trust My Doctor To give Me The Required Information For Any Medical Question s That I Might Have at the time
1	My primary care physician is very friendly and likable. She always makes sure that I feel comfortable and I understand all of my options.
-1	I trust a physician to have the knowledge and experiences to at least to best explain and point me in the right direction of addressing  health issues.
-1	I trust my doctor to do her job. To diagnose and treat. Doctors have gone to countless lectures and read numerous medical books and journals. They know much more about the human body and how it works than I do. With that being said, Doctors are still people and they do make mistakes but I trust them a lot more than Iâd trust a medically uneducated person to treat me.
-1	I have had some recent negative experiences with my doctor perscribing certain medications that have extreme negative side effects and my assumption as to why this medication was prescribed to me was because of the comission the doctor receives from the pharmaceutical company.
-1	"She doesnt take the time to figure out my treatment optionsb she just goes with the first thing she knows. If she doesnt know of an alternative, she says its something i ""have to do"" regardless of negative side effects I've already experienced on that course of treatment. In my own personal reaearch i often discover multiple other avenues of treatment thay may work better for me, but she is unwilling to listen to my concerns."
-1	I sometimes trust and distrust doctor. I have had a bad experience when My mom passed away due to A doctor sugar coating things for my mom many years ago. He did not give her guidance or answer any questions about her illness, thus I have many trust issues with any doctor. Including dentist or a nurse. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for several years. He has proven over time that he wants to keep me healthy. He has never diagnosed me incorrectly so I have no reason to believe he is lazy or incompetent. 
-1	I mostly trust my primary care doctor. I trust them in addressing my concerns and treating my problem appropriately. Sometimes, I feel like doctors differ over what treatment option is best so I get a second opinion.
-1	She is helping me with my condition and she has more knowledge in that area than i do, so i trust her that she is doing the right thing.
-1	My most recent primary care physician was very dismissive of my needs, did not inform me of the seriousness of my condition, and overall did not spend the requisite time with me to inform me of my condition. I am still living with the relevant condition as a result. 
-1	Physicians are so busy I feel like they do not always take the time to fully listen and give all options. I trust that they would not put me in harm but I don't trust that I'm always given all available options. They are also highly restricted by insurance companies drug coverage etc.
1	My doctor takes his time and does not rush. He gives me many options for treatment and often asks for my preferences and input.
1	I've had her for 2 years and she'll always take the time to explain things to me and seems genuinely concerned. Since I'm on medicare not all doctors seem to think I'm not worth their time. That hasn't happened too much though. 
-1	Even though doctors are trained and have a plethora of knowledge, your body knows what's best. Trust your gut feeling, pray for wisdom, research information and listen to what your body is telling you.
-1	:I trust my primary care physician because for the most part, they have always given me reliable information. They seem to be very knowledgeable about the conditions I am facing and experienced with those conditions. The take their time in delivering the best care possible to me.
-1	I haven't had a lot of experience with my new doctor that would allow me to build a proper relationship.
1	My doctor listens to my concerns and answers my questions thoroughly. My doctor also provides health information as needed.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because she is very kind and compassionate and always discusses all treatment options to understand what is best for me.
1	I have had the same primary care doctor for over 10 years. She is very thorough and explains her reasoning for any medication that she prescribes. She listens and pays attention to what I have to say.
-1	I believe that the doctor may have your best interest cat heart, but that doesn't mean that the doctor knows everything .
-1	I don't think that my doctor hears what I am saying all of the time.  I also feel like the answer to everything with him is a new medication.  I would prefer to try and solve health issues without medication first.
1	Thus far I haven't had a reason to not trust him, he's done a fine job with my care as far as I can tell.
1	I've had no reason to not trust him. He always explains things well to me. He doesn't do unnecessary tests and doesn't seem interest d in overbilling for things, just gets right to the point and gets me out of there. 
1	They are not perfect and can make mistakes. A second and third opinion is best. My goal is not to say anything about the other doctors and see if each says the same thing.
-1	I Trust them because I go there and they make me feel good about everything and they take the best care of me 
1	Doctors in general should care about their patients needs because not only it's their job but many people need help from someone who would know more about the medical field then they do
-1	I've been going to my doctor for over 20 years.  He knows my history and persolity.  I can talk honestly with him and he'll have an engaging conversation.
-1	My doctor has been a family friend for years and is aware of my needs. My doctor treats me like a member of family and makes sure that someone has the information I need before I leave in case I forget what needs to be done at a later date or later on in the day. 
-1	I think I can trust my doctor enough to know what is wrong with me but i would get a second opinion if I had something big wrong or thought the answer was not up to par.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because i believe him.
-1	Sometimes doctors Can lie and sometimes they can to the truth. I think you should go to more than one doctor to figure out what's wrong with you.
1	I trust my doctor because he has decades of experience in conventional medicine, and also has obtained extra courses lately in naturopathy. He is very knowledgable about medical conditions and how to treat them both conventionally or alternatively with herbs, homeopathy etc. He always looks me in the eye and listens. 
-1	At times, my doctor seems more focused on generating money than actually treating me. I have had several tests that seemed unnecessary. 
1	The doctors I've dealt with have all been upfront and straightforward with me about whatever condition I've had. They've never deceived me and I've had no reason to distrust them or the advice they've given.
-1	Doctors like my primary care physician are mostly thinking about the pharmaceutical companies and the bonuses they get while masking the problems and side effects as care to their patients.
1	I trust primary care physician. I have no other options for healthcare for who else will I trust. I think the current Healthcare System is great and I'm glad that Obama Care takes care of everyone. Without Healthcar without Healthcare no one will live a good life.
-1	He has been forthcoming on everything i need to know about my condition and what i need to do to take care of it.
-1	Alot of doctors care about making more money not about peoples actual needs. As in they make money off of giving prescriptions. You see so many people taking medicine. People dieing faster off taking medications prescribed by the doctor.
1	My doctor listens to me. She tells me te tests I should get and talks about my weight.
-1	I don't think I have seen my primary care physician enough to establish more trust.  I have only seen her once, so most of my answers are based off experiences that I have had with doctors in general, mostly OBs.
-1	I feel that doctors often are overbooked and take the easy way out.  Itâs got to be a nightmare dealing with insurance companies.  Many just treat every patient the same.
1	My primary care physician has been very effective in treating my present health issues to such an extent that my condition has greatly improved in a remarkably short period of time. Of course, I played a role in following the instructions; it is, after all, a cooperative effort. Her guidance and approach has been first rate.
1	I have only seen my doctor a few times since we moved to Kentucky but she seems to be very upfront and honest about things.  She also has to be just about one of the kindest people that I have met since moving here.  
1	My wife and some other family members have the same doctor as I do. All of us have good things to say about my doctor. She does a good job each time I go to see her at an appointment. The reason I didn't put strongly agree is because all doctors are't 100% perfect and that some of the decisions regarding medication are mine. There are a few prescriptions I am on that I am not the biggest fan of. 
-1	They always explain themselves if i have any medical issues, go over the options and help to find a cheaper solution if i cna t afford the first one 
-1	I don't trust them as much as I use tro. They do not take the time to learn about you and listen to your concerns it is a joke.
1	"I have known him my entire life, and he is a second father to me - very, very close family friends who helped raise me. He is calm, ratiol, compassiote, and works with patients by listening to what they know is going on in their own bodies, what's ""normal"" for them, etc, instead of railroading them. Pharma reps have 0 influence on him - he is above reproach morally. He's going to retire soon and I don't know what I'm going to do!"
1	I believe that doctors in general have their patients needs first in mind, but I also feel like they are over worked and over stressed. They also don't necessarily have all the answers, and have to solve some problems through trail and error.
-1	I trust my doctors in general. I don't think there is any reason for a doctor to lie to me or try and deceive me. They may not always be the most attentive or take the most time to get to know what's wrong, but I don't think they're ever intentionally deceitful or anything like that.
-1	I feel that I have complained about the same symptoms for several years and only recently has the dr started to listen to my valid complaints. I understand that people have a magnitude of problems, but getting answers is very important
-1	I have a sense of security with my doctor. I trust them to do their best and provide me with the information I need to help me with a certain problem 
-1	I trust my primary doctor because  the love and care and concern he has for my health. the doctors makes sure that he explains and let me know everything about my health plan
1	my doctor hasn't given me any reason to doubt his thoroughness, especially since i follow up his treatment with my own research on other treatments and medicines.
1	She has never lied or led me in the wrong direction.
-1	They know me better than I know myself and have always given me good advice and care. If I didn't trust them then I would probably switch to a different doctor. Trust is definitely important 
-1	I feel that they usually know what they are doing but you can't expect them to care deeply about you because they see so many people that can't care about each one a great deal. Doctors work long hours and make mistakes because they are human so you need to watch what they do and say carefully to as a mistake they make can cause a good deal of harm to you or possibly death. Doctors are also going to lie from time to time as again they are human., in my experience doctors also have an over inflated ego which can cause problems as they are less likely to second guess their decisions.
1	I trust doctors 100%  Occasionally one physician will allow his physician assistant to speak with me I do not like this and let physician assistant know no offense I prefer to speak with my doctor
-1	They have been my primary care doctor for years.  My doctor is careing and usually takes time to listen to me.  She has been able to help me with most problems and trusts me as a patient.  She also has been a doctor to most of my family for years and knows my history.
-1	It is easy to trust a doctor if they are willing to give you time to talk to them.  Many doctors are in and out so quickly that it's had to even get an impression of them.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he seems to be genuine when he asks how I am feeling. He engages in normal conversation about my life and reassures me that I am doing just fine. He seems knowledgable about his expertise and keeps an open mind about questions that I may have.
1	I have been seeing my current doctor for nearly 2 years, but my experience with doctors in general is very consistent. Every time I have a question about my overall health or a specific condition, my doctor is able to clearly explain his thoughts on the matter. 
-1	I have known my PCP since I was born. My parents really liked him, but I never was comfortable around him. At times he would send me for too many tests and other times he wouldn't send me enough. He never seemed to care about me, just what made him feel important. The Physician Assistants in his office are just as bad, if not worse. Just recently I switched my PCP and have an upcoming appointment with my new PCP 
-1	I  trust my pcp because i have known him and when others were questioning his treatment methods his methodology proved most correct.
-1	I trust them for the most part but they do seem to make sp judgements and not to go in depth as i would like
-1	In general, I think doctors are in alliance with pharmaceutical companies and get fees for prescriptions they generate.
1	They are passionate about what they do and took an oath to uphold a certain code to protect people in every way that they can.
1	Doctor dont tell u everything they just trying to get paid just want u to take different medications
1	I do not know my doctor very well but the contact. Inhave had with her is all positive. She has answered all my questions and has been correct in her diagnosis of my conditions.
-1	I distrust because Dr's are human too.
-1	I do not believe that he spends enough time with me to really get to know me. He has given me drugs which help a little, but never asked me in depth about my chronic pain or fatigue, nor has he referred me to a specialist who could.
-1	Doctors do not respect the moral or philosophical views which differ from their own regarding treatment. They treat symptoms and not underlying causes of illness and they do this by pushing medications that cause more harm and side effects to the body, thereby increasing the problems (and the number of medications) that one must battle.
-1	I feel that my doctor has often gone out of her way to help since I am in a very dire financial situation. As well she has given me advice and recommendations for alternative treatments for certain problems I have had i.e.she does not believe that drugs are a cure-all but helps me get to the root of certain health conditions.
1	My primary care physicians takes the time to talk to me, even discussing things that are going on with my family and work that might be affecting my health. She seems truly concerned about my well-being.
-1	Regarding doctors in general (I haven't seen a primary care physician in many years), I feel like I can trust them somewhat. As I've gotten older though, I think I've become more skeptical about doctors, knowing that, for example, doctors get a higher kickback on certain drugs or treatments than others, so there is a benefit to them to get you to take a particular treatment option. I still trust doctors in diagnosis, but treatment I'm more skeptical. 
-1	"She is very busy and quick and gives recommendations rather than talking to me and asking if I want a certain test or procedure. In general I prefer a less ""medical"" approach to health care than she does."
1	I mean, it is their job to make sure that I receive the best care possible. I am sure they don't want to be facing some sort of repercussions based on how they care for me. I would like to think that they became doctors to help people like me to get the best care they can administer, and so it would be somewhat out of character if they were to skimp on my care.
-1	I usually look things up online before going to the doctor. When I do this, what my doctor and the internet says usually matches yp
1	He takes time with me, listens to me and is very responsive and honest.  He is caring and personable, easy to talk to.  
-1	You and she is the best mother I know I love you I have to work out at work today and she came the same way as I did am I just woke and my soul and my aunt was the best same way with god me to god I am a god and I am not going through it and god god bless god and god bless I god bless god you bless god you god and she is god god and I am not god working with you god god and god I am not god bless you she is god bless you god god bless her and she bless you and god bless you she said the 
1	My PCP was recommended to me and I felt comfortable around her from the first time we met.  We have similar views about certain issues and that leads me to believe that she will definitely have my best interest in mind.
1	My doctor listens to me and explains test results clearly. If I have any questions he takes the time to answer them. He doesn't rush through anything.
1	My physician is young and understands that the medical industry has changed in that not all problems are solved by taking prescription drugs or undergoing intrusive procedures.
-1	I trust my physician because he has always been right about what treatments I need over the years, and he has been my doctor for a long time. Since he has never been wrong, I feel that I can trust him. 
1	My doctor takes her time to listen to my concerns and is not in a rush to get me out the door.
-1	I trust the doctor because she seems sincere.  She has a no waste time approach and although I think she is giving me the bum's rush at times, she has never been wrong in her prognosis.
-1	My primary care physician has dismissed my worries and problems before. She misdiagnosed one of my family members and that family member ended up in the hospital because of it.
-1	I don't really trust or distrust him, I am kind of ambivalent about him.  He seems perfectly nice but he's usually in quite a rush and makes me feel like I'm a hassle just for being there sometimes.  I don't like that he doesn't remember or check information in my chart, especially since it's a small practice and I've been there for years.  If I'm in for strep throat or something, he always tries to prescribe a medicine I'm allergic to and his nurse has to stop him.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part, He does what he can to help me when I come to him with a problem. But one time when I suspected I had a ear infection coming and he said it was my neck. Few days later I had an infection
1	she seems to listen and takes time to hear all my questions.  also available for emails.  her staff is also very kind and attentive
-1	I basically trust my physician because she was able to help me with an issue that a previous doctor did not attempt to address.  I also feel that she listens to my problems and takes them seriously.  However, due to previous experiences with doctors, I am uble to trust any of them completely. 
-1	I mostly distrust my primary care physician because she changes her mind often and rushes through appointments.
-1	"I don't completely distrust my primary care physician as much as I think he just doesn't care.  He seems pretty apathetic and uninterested in what's going on with me.  I don't think he realizes that I do take my health seriously most of the time and so I am going to do things that most people won't do to take charge of my health.  Where most people want a magic pill, I am willing to make changes in my lifestyle.  I don't think my doctor necessarily cares.  He just wants to prescribe a pill because it's the quickest easiest way to ""fix"" the problem."
-1	In general, I am a skeptical person so probably likely to questions all things, so it seems like I am not completely trusting. Also, I don't feel like the doctor listens carefully to what I am saying, so I am hesitant to put complete in the doctor.  I don't think the doctor will intentiolly lead me in a wrong direction but maybe not the best option for me. 
-1	I trust that my primary care physician will tell me the truth about my health and well being and making sure that I'm dieting and exercising daily 
1	My doctors and dentist are honest and trustworthy.  I have been going to them for a long time and find them to be interested in my health and they have always been receptive to answering my questions and concerns.
1	"I do believe in being informed, myself, but at the end of the day, for some things, one has to trust an ""expert"" - I feel that picking a doctor is hard. But once you have picked a doctor you feel you can trust, then you should trust them."
-1	My doctor has gone to great lengths to help me. I am always confident that they know what they are doing or are at least trying to help. This is why I keep going to them.
-1	I really don't put a lot of trust in doctors as there are many who will prescribe medications that may not be necessary in order to get the bonuses drug companies offer to promote their drugs.  I prefer doctors that will consider alternative or natural medication
1	I trust my physician because she has always been honest with me and straight forward. She always tells me things even if it isn't exactly what I want to hear 
-1	I have been with my physician for over a year and she has been very helpful. Always open to questions I have and takes time to explain things to me when I need her to.
-1	"My current doctor is better than doctors I've had in the past, and he has been able to help me more; he listens to me more. Unfortutely he has some attitudes about certain newer medical conditions--one of which I almost certainly have--that makes it hard us to really ""connect."" He does discuss treatment plans with me on the things he CAN help me with, though."
-1	He knows more about me medically than I know about myself. After all he is a doctor and has studied in fields that I have no knowledge of.
-1	I trust my doctor because She is someone I have known for a long time and also knows my family.  This person has always had my best intentions and has always helped me to feel better when I was feeling ill.
1	I've known my doctor for a long time. He always takes the time with me answering all the questions that I have.  I never feel rushed.
1	I have been going to the same PCP for many years and trust him completely, he has never given me a reason to question his practices or choices with regard to my health care and always puts my needs first 
1	My PCP always sits and listens to me and together we choose an appropriate course of action.  She explains anything I question.
-1	When I've gone to my physician or even one at an emergency care facility they often try to rush you and generalize what is going on. This would be when you explain symptoms and you say you've had a bad cough for three weeks and they just blow you off and tell you there is a cold going around and when you end up in an emergency room you find out you had a bacterial infection in your lungs. Its hard to trust them as it's a business now and they move people in and out like cattle. If you're lucky your Dr will spend 5 minutes with you but the nurses usually do all the interview work.
-1	I have established a relationship with my doctor over a few years, and find his advice to be pretty trustworthy for the most part. If I ask about other options, he is glad to take the time to talk to me. 
1	I just found a new PCP, because my old one was grossly overweight and seemed to not treat  patients as individuals; she wasn't always this way; I know she has some personal problems.  She was wrong about some side effects I was having, and wouldn't listen to me.  My new PCP is very thorough, is a good listener, and is helping co-ordinate my care with several specialists, after an unexpected hospitalization.
-1	My primary care doctor always tells me the truth. They also always tell me how to help fix things and if I am on track and doing well. I always listen to their advice. 
-1	my doctor is very through in way he does, he has me come every three months for a check up and to get my meds refilled and every 6 months he does my yearly and checks my blood, urine and checks my prostate
-1	I feel that it is neutral when you first meet your doctor but as sessions go on, it is very important for you to be able to talk to your doctor and for them to truly care.
-1	Well, on the one hand, I trust my doctor because he is a trained professiol and I assume is there because he wants to help people as most doctors probably do.  On the other hand, medicine today is still very much a business.  Money.  And as we all know, when money is involved, there is an inherent conflict of interest at times and we must find very moral doctors who will rise above this conflict and do what is right.  Not all do.
1	I dont my parents have been here  but I see that I lose once I walk out the dooor to something else orthers will take how they feel about health care and use it for the self and not orthers people are a custom to hear they ant shit and it just builts problem more and more for that person to have mental break downs but it has move from mental to physical as well and it is excepted that the y get off the hook and not say on the hook .  That like some else keep you down and know one else stoping that or people have always stopped you from reading body langurs then anything esker in there mind I'm going to do what he wants and win . That. Like in heriting some else s life . Hope my thing is not to keep find the wrong thing to do and try to do the right thing but life has changed for me and orthers see that I have made the, feel uncomfortable in there own home but the will use it to show some one you aren't me or you don't work 
1	My doctor is willing to listen and doesn't ignore my concerns. She brings up different options and will let me choose which of them I think would work best for my situation. Overall, I'm very happy with my PCP.
1	i like so much visit to doctor because him is a person excelent. in all moment the docot speak trust 
1	She is nice and talks about things openly and never talks rudely about anything or anyone. She is always willing to help with medical needs.
1	First of all its I do not trust to many people, do the doctors and nurses, police and everybody else falls into this category.
1	My doctor is out for my best interest. He will make decisions not based on his hospital's needs, but the patient.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because of his professionalism. However, if I'm not satisfied I can ask the second opinion.
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel he genuinely wants to help. Whenever I seek him, he would give me all sorts of reasoble suggestions to help improve my health, responds to email, etc.
1	He has many years of experience, is honest and he finds out what's wrong so I don't have to keep coming back 
-1	I generally like his recommendations and what he says seems reasonable most of the time. He diesn't appear to want to give me a lot of medications. he speaks of getting off the medication as a possibility.
1	My primary dr has been my dr for 25 years,  I trust her, I think she is great.  he never hesitates to help me
-1	I went to them and told them I believe I had something, they brushed me off and said I was fine. Four visits and hundreds of dollars later I was diagnosed with that very thing and then was given a treatment that did not work.
-1	Too many doctors are in it for the money and I have seen evidence that my doctor feels the same way.
1	my dr has never let me down .i am very happy with my dr he is a great dr .He is there when i need him 
1	I had a primary care physician that I liked and trusted very much. She had me do a number of tests when I first saw her so she could see what was going on. She is always listened and answered all questions I had, she had a caring personality, non-judgy. Sadly she moved and I am currently looking for a new primary care physician. 
-1	I have been seeing my PCP for 10 years and he has always been very good in all ways until two years ago I was sick and nobody could figure out what was wrong. My Dr told me I was just beginning the change of life called perimenopause and had nothing to worry about. I knew that was not right I was much to sick for it to be normal. I went through 5 additional Drs trying to get answers and even specialists. I finally found one Dr who actually sat down and talked to me for an hour which never happens but he could see how sick I was and I had lost so much weight I weighed 81lbs....so he did a whole battery of blood tests and finally after 2 years of being mostly bedridden I had an answer. It was or could have been found in the beginning if my Dr would have listened to me and just did some bloodwork. After that I will go to my regular pcp but I don't trust him after that, he could have killed me. I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia which is a vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Thank God for that one Dr and my gut instincts.
1	"For my primary care physician I reserve time to meet with the doctor to discuss my health care plan to see if we can have a honest and open relationship in managing my health. I would not continue to see a physician that did not have time to discuss my health, ensure all my questions and concerns are addressed, and ever said to me ""you wouldn't understand or just do as I say"". Health care is a team effort between the patient, family members, and care Providers."
1	It's not working its very important to be with the best sites that are not have the wiki l a lot more
-1	I don't completely trust my pcp. It often seems that if they don't properly diagnose a condition the first time, that they want to blame the patient instead of looking further to figure out exactly what the problem is. I feel like a lot of the time, they can't be bothered to listen, because in their minds, they've already decided what the truth is. 
1	She always takes into considerations all my concerns and answers my questions thoroughly. Has a lot of patience with me, and never makes me feel judged or that she's basing her judgment on a stereotype or character judgment. Takes care of my varied problems the best she can with what I can do.
1	I have been going to my doctor for years and have not had any problems. She tells me exactly what I need to do and why
-1	I feel that with my interactions with my primary care physician he shows a good amount of concern for my well being. I trust him because he gives me all the information I need to make a decision and gives me his opinions and experience to help me.
1	"I trust pcp a lot. She has been my doctor for several years and she has been great. She knows me well and works with me to help me mage my health problems. I'm not ""just another number"" with her. "
-1	These days I feel that doctors care (with some exceptions) more about their bottom line than their patients.  Not so long ago I believed everything that my doctors would tell me but not any longer.  I was particularly miffed when a former orthopedist had no clue as to how to help me after I fractured my hip and got really upset when I sought a second opinion and had the other doctor operate on me.
1	I trust me primary care physician because she seems to really care about her patients. She provides the truth about and problems and presents all solutions. 
-1	I trust doctors to the extent that I believe that they are knowledgeable about the specific issue being addressed. Not all doctors are well-informed, nor do they have expertise in all areas. 
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I know that insurance plays into this. Some things just don't get approved so they have to tell me different stuff. Also their persol beliefs play in so I know they  may not be honest with me at times.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he is very in tuned to my needs and is constantly learned more about medical needs.
1	My doctors are honest and only do/prescribe treatments they feel are necessary. They make decisions based on me as an individual.
1	I trust him because in the years that I have gone to him he doesn't seem to push anything on me as far as medication and most times gives me a practical way to work with illnesses I might have.
-1	I have a hard in easy life in I try to do the right thing all the time but life can have a way of bring you down in doubt yourself in put you in a negative mood but I try to over come it 
-1	All Dr,s first must consider the likelihood that a male practice law suit could be filed against them. I personally trust my primary care physician as she has been up forward with me about all my conditions and or complaints.
-1	I feel like my doctor takes the time to talk to me and truly understand what I need. If he didnt, I would switch doctors
1	I trust her because she seems so genuine and caring. She is very thorough when giving me information and very knowledgeable. We have a lot in common and I can really relate to her. 
-1	They take good care but I prefer to be natural and not take drugs for everything because that's bad in the long run and end up hurting you because of side effects 
1	My present doctor is the best I have ever had.  He is a Polish Jew and is very caring and compassionate.
-1	Seems like he is into giving out pills like he is influenced by drug sales. So could be conflict of interest there.
1	So far everything that my doctor has told me has been one hundred percent open. He hasn't hidden anything from me or told me half truths. I have a lot of trust in him and don't have any kind of doubts of what he tells me. I follow everything what he says. My doctor also answers any question I have, whether it be a dumb one or not. He always answers my questions to the fullest of his ability. I feel I can continue trusting him in dealing with my health. That is why I trust my doctor in whatever he tells me.
-1	I am new to my primary doctor he seem well informed of my chronic condition and orders test appropriately, responds to my questions in timely manner. 
-1	He has many years of education and experience. But he is also most likely getting kickbacks from drug companies which may influence his prescribing of medicine.
-1	I generally trust medical professionals, but I know that they are also humans with their own self-interests.
-1	I do believe the dr gives you right diagnosis sometime Spme0 you need a second opinion they do miss the mark
-1	I don't go to the doctor often and have no medical condition. I don't have a doctor I see regularly for anything so I don't really have anything to base an answer off of.
1	I have not had a situation when my doctor has been wrong or dishonest. She always goes over any options I may have. She explains everything clearly and is open to answer any of my questions.
1	My physicians assistant is very kind, listens, engaging, good sense of humor and makes me feel comfortable. He does not make me feel bad about myself if i am unsure or if i feel the need to vent or unload about a situation that is tied to feeling unwell to my situation. I would be very upset if he changes practices. 
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. I trust him implicitly to attend to my health and well being.
-1	I generally trust my current doctor, and I think she's a lot more trustworthy than the ones I've seen before, and she always takes extra time to explain things to me and walk me through my health plan. However, I've only seen her a few times over the past couple of years, and I don't completely trust her yet. I guess I just have an ingrained distrust of doctors when it comes to prescribing medications due to previous negative experiences with them disregarding the side effects I was having and pushing medications on me that were not essential (such as birth control pills and certain sleeping pills).
-1	I don't trust my primary care physician because I never hear back from them about test results. Also because I always have to wait forever for her to come back and then feel rushed when she does come in. 
1	My doctor is a candid, relaxed older gentleman who seems to always say exactly what he means. He has never given me the impression that he's in a hurry to see other patients, or that he wants to quickly diagnose me. He's put me through thorough tests, asked me a lot of questions, and suggested many options to me.  The fact that he's so thorough and patient makes me completely trust him to act in my best interests.
-1	I believe that there are a lot of doctors who are in the job field to help others. However, I also believe that the pharmaceutical industry is the biggest drug cartel in the world. I have personally dealt with doctors putting money before my needs. I still believe that there are good moraled doctors. 
-1	not a good bedside manner and doesnt listen to questions. not very nice person.some doctors are very rude and dont like to help people.
-1	I want to have full trust in my primary doctor but I feel like some training is outdated.  I feel that pharmaceutical companies influence doctors greatly.  I've experienced a situation where I was not given all my options and I feel surgery was recommended and pushed to make money.  I feel like it's too much about making money and less about making people healthy.  Especially considering the fact that Americans are growing more and more unhealthy - kids and adults alike.
1	I think the doctor I have has made several diagnosis that have been correct about me over the years, so because of that I trust him quite a bit. Doctors do seem to minimize the time they see me in the office but I can forgive that since they are very busy.
1	I have been with him for over 10 years and we have developed a trust. If I had to find a new doctor, I would have a hard time finding one that I have the same kinds of relationship with.
1	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  I trust him completely for my care.  He does a great job.  I would listen to his advice and suggestions. 
-1	I trust the doctor because he is experienced and deals with patients with similar problems. Since he is familiar in his field he will know how to treat me. 
1	I fully trust my primary care MD because we have a longtime patient/Dr relationship.  She is fully aligned with my health outcome goals and supports me toward those.
-1	My Doctor spends a lot of time listening to me which makes me feel as though she truly wants the best for me. However, now and then she writes referrals or orders tests that I never hear about again and had nothing to do with my complaints.
-1	Although I'm sure he gives great information, I have a feeling that most doctors as well as my own throw out information in order to benefit themselves. Better feedback means more clients, etc. I feel like most solutions to my problems are a bit forced and not genuine.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for years and so has other members of my family. She has always given me the medical advice that I need and I trust her to do what is best for me. She is always open to any questions that I have and is able to explain things that I may not understand. If I happen to not understand she has no problem giving me more info. She tells me if I have any questions to not hesitate to call her. That puts me at ease if I need to call again for anything follow up questions she is there and if she is not there is always another doctor or nurse to help me,
-1	He always seems busy and does not provide enough details face to face. Depending too much on his staff instead of providing personal care.
-1	Gut feeling.  Haven't been given a reason to distrust.  she comes across as knowledgeable about my condition.
1	My doctor was a friend of my father. My father used to be a doctor until his death. He always talked about what a great doctor his friend was.
-1	My doctor tends to rush my appointments. She is in and out in less than five minutes, and doesn't really seem to read any of the paperwork I fill out or really take much interest in the concerns I bring to the appointment. Last time, for example, I brought in concerns about my back pain, but she seemed more concerned about my borderline high blood pressue and gave my a referral to a cardiologist.
