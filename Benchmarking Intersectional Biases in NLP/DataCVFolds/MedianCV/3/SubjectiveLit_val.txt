There aren't a lot of places that you can go to find dependable information for you to make your decisions. Hospitals and doctors are expensive to see and impossible to deal with if you are just needing information and websites can be confusing and misleading.

They get their degree then stop doing their job before they even have one. They can't be trusted. So even when I do get the rare chance to receive medical information, it is usually false, biased, or worthless. They don't believe that I know what's best for my body, but that's becuase they don't care. They don't think that anyone that hasn't wasted 8 years of their life and over $200,000 could possibly know or understand anything. Their all arrogant, narcissistic, self-entitled failures. They. Don't. Care.

So i feel like the communication is not there and i often feel rushed and just put to the side in terms of the concerns I have.

Regardless, I grew up surrounded by medical discussions and spend a great deal of time with health-care professionals and as a consequence am extremely comfortable with them, asking them questions, and challenging them. Obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information to make appropriate health choices is something I'm very comfortable with.
1	I have full capacity to read, process, and understand basic health information to make decisions for myself or a loved one.
1	I feel that I can certainly obtain, process and understand basic health information and services when I need to make health decisions. At anytime I don't understand something, I will ask a knowledgeable person about what they think, ask them to explain it to me in a better manner or point me in the direction of the information that I'm needed to make an informed decision. I haven't ran into too many instances where I needed additiol assistance in understand and making health issues.
1	I am very confident with obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.  I am a very educated woman holding a MPA in Hospital administration 
-1	I feel like I can understand my doctor or nurse most of the time. However, there have been several occasions when my doctor tried to explain something to me that was over my understanding, or he simply didn't care to try and explain it in a way I could understand. Sometimes I leave with more questions than when I came in. My doctors tend to rush out of the room and I feel like they already have one foot out the door when they speak with me.
-1	I feel I am very lucky because I am able to understand and process information about my health better than most to a very high degree, unless there are circumstances. I am a student, and decently intelligent, along with having taken many scientific courses; I feel this gives me an advantage. However in some cases, I am still troubled. For example, I have trouble when I am very anxious about a Dr. visit or technique to be utilized, and this can hinder my comprehension, requiring me to ask for help or repeats of information. This could also apply to an emergency visit or ER visit, as I will be stressed and in a lesser state of consciousness than normal.
-1	I feel I'm easily able to amalgamate and coalesce basic health information, although I may not have the technical understanding of the information. I haven't had many hospital experience, but the ones I have had were pleasant apart from the circumstance.
1	I think there is adequate information available for me to understand, process, obtain basic health information and services. I think I could always check online for more information or ask the persons.

-1	I discuss issues with my husband and we ask questions  together to make sure we both understand everything 
-1	Im pretty good when i go see a doctor.  I usually alwaus have someone with me who can help me understand what is being said and what information is given to me.  I do not always understand medical terminology that is why someone is always with me.
-1	I feel I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. Insurance confuses me sometimes, but as far as actual  symptoms and treatment, I am confident.

-1	I do understand somethings when it comes to the basic health information we receive, but donât really understand some terms they use for explaining what it really is. My wife is some what in that feels so she explains a lot to me.  Based off the little I know and my wife knowledge I feel that I will make the right decisions.
1	I feel have good capacity to obtain and understand such information.  When there is something that requires further clarification I find it easy to get additional information from a number of different sources.
-1	I have a good time understanding the basics to making good health decisions. They gave me all the details about making decisions about my health and it doesn't take that long to understand the basics of it. 
-1	I believe that often times, I am able to read and assess the situation that is provided to me in terms of my basic health information. The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me. This is perhaps due to the fact that past a point, my knowledge regarding treatment and medications is lacking, and doctors do not often have the time to explain in detail exactly what certain things do. Even when they do, they do not specify side effects of treatments. As such, I am often worried about what will happen. 
1	I feel like I have the perfect capacity to understand health decisions. I have a good primary care doctor who always makes sure I leave the building with all questions answered. The staff is always informative and helpful. 
1	I am a literate and well read person. I regularly deal with contracts and official documents in my regular line of work. Up until now I have had no issues with healthcare paperwork or communicating with healthcare workers I have visited in the past. Basic healthcare information is quite understandable to me.
-1	Yes if not I will look the information up or ask for help or have Husband explain it to me or I will ask the Nurse to write down or give me a brochure about the condition or what ever I need help looking up
1	I can look up symptoms online and hazard a guess but I understand that I can't do much more than guess. Information given to me by doctors and nurses I tend to trust but if I'm still not certain I will look up further information for myself online. I wouldn't have access to any specialized machines to try to diagnose myself so for that at least I'm completely reliant on health professionals. Things like blood tests, urine flow test, cultures etc.
-1	I feel like I can review my health records well enough. When I was in the military, I used to review my records occasionally since they were available online. Sometimes, I didn't understand things and would ask. My sister is a nurse so I am able to ask her about anything I need. My best friend's father is also a Neuro-surgeon. If I have questions about anything, I ask them.
-1	I think I have basic understanding of these topics. Anything I do not understand I will try to learn. 
1	I am currently cogent and intellectually capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information.

-1	I feel like if I use my knowledge and information collected from credible websites, I usually have a good idea of any conditions that I currently have BEFORE I ever see my doctor or nurse, and so I know which questions to ask when my appointment rolls around. One major issue is that medical professionals tend to ignore or downplay questions and concerns by patients At least that's been my experience and I truly resent it because I'm not some unintelligent yokel, I have a genius-level IQ and I'm obsessive about researching things, so it angers me when people talk down to me or dismiss my concerns because they have a piece of paper hanging on their wall.

1	I read all information given go me and if any issues I will ask for clarification so that I have full understanding.  On occassions, I may ask family/friends as well as look up info, opinions, results and/or reactions from other patient who may have experienced something similar online.

1	I have been with the same doctor for about 15 years. I am very comfortable asking him questions about any issues I have. I do not feel like he rushes to get me out of the office. He takes his time and answers my questions. He is thorough in all my health care needs.
-1	I feel to some extent that I comprehend the information that they relay to me, however some medical terms are hard to follow, so I most of the time would do online research after leaving the appointment, I also google any prescribed medications so that way i'm well aware of what the side effects or outcome will be. Once I feel comfortable with the treatment prescribed then I will follow the recommended doses information.

I have to visually see what the doctors and nurses are saying to comprehend it. Just listening is not enough to register my condition.

Still, there are many terms and things that I am not aware of today and can always use the help/guidance of professiols in explaining some of these current health issues today.  It never hurts to get more information I feel.

1	I can understand and process all the information in most cases because i feel like my health care providers explain in full whatever questions i have. 
-1	I feel strongly that one, due to the get them in and out in 15 minutes has to often go to outside sources to help with their own health care. It often takes longer to fill out forms pre doc visit than the time that is spent with a person and that they only glance at the forms. Thankfully there is google and many other seach engines and websites and forums where one can practically, at least with simple maladies, get all the information they need.  I feel personal I have the capacity, I feel strongly that doctors and nurses do not take the time to explain as they should.

1	I can understand as well or better than most people what medical conditions or treatments are described by doctors and nurses.

I do not need any help reading or remembering directions and instructions regarding medical care.
1	I am not a science-minded person, so the medical information I receive is not obvious or tural to me. Therefore I like to listen to everything a medical professiol says to me, because I am learning along the way. Since I like learning about new things in life, I have no problem being interested and understanding what they are telling me.

-1	all i do is talk toa docter about my health problems and what i should be doing to keep my body healthy.

1	A great deal. I can ask questions of the medical person. I can also look up more info online. I use different methods to find needed clarity.
-1	I usually am able to follow what I am being told in regards to the medical information given to me, however, there have been times when I needed more information and did not ask for it. I would get flustered by them trying to hurry me up or hurry me out of the office that I forget what I wanted or needed to ask. 
1	I have zero problems when it comes to getting and or receiving information from medical providers. I believe in asking questions and getting answers.
-1	I feel that I am fully capable of asking questions surrounding my own healthcare. The problem is I can become embarrassed or shy while I'm trying to advocate for my needs and make sure that I get all the information that I need to. It's also hard for me when the doctor or a nurse is behind schedule or seems to be in a rush. If that's the case, then I'm almost afraid to ask a question because I don't want to get the brush-off. 
-1	I feel that I have enough knowledge to understand. I really do. I feel I am smart. I feel confident in the up Most created certainty

Additionally, I have access to the internet via smartphone, so I have essentially all of the knowledge in the world at my fingertips if need be.
-1	When I go to the doctor office due to some illness I used to tell the whole history about the illness and how it is affecting my physical condition and how long it is there and I will ask them what to do on this and how will the treatment proceed and how much duration it may take to get all set.
-1	I have an average ability to understand health related topics when they are explained to me. Often I will do research on my own that sometimes conflicts with the information my healthcare providers give me so I need that explained
-1	I usually have no problems but sometimes I just need a little help. But I have people I can go to explain things. I have friends in the health care industry.
-1	I feel that I can understand and process some of the basic health information that is needed to make the appropriate health decision but sometimes health information can be overwhelming even basic. I feel if I could process it and understand it better then I would put a greater trust in the medical profession.
1	I strongly believe one must advocate for themselves. To that end, I have read a lot of PDRs, and when Google came along all information I could absorb about relevant things. I read the papers that come with my prescriptions. 
-1	I feel completely good. I go in knowing exactly what I need to ask and make sure I leave knowing all the information that I need to know. 
1	I am capable of understanding most medical information whether it is by reading or listening to a professiol.  I am confident that I understand what I am told and most remember to ask the important questions.

I feel there are many other resources out there to get the information I need in order to be able to understand most health information.
1	I like reading all the paperwork handed to me by my doctor so I can better understand whatever condition or issue I may have.  If I don't understand a particular condition I always ask my doctor or the nurse.  If I happen to be at home, I usually email my doctor and also look up the definition of certain medical terminology on the internet.  All in all, I like making sure I'm well aware of any condition or illnesses. 
1	I feel that I am able to process most all that I need when it comes to health care information.  Most of the forms are 8th grade level or less.  Also, the medical information on my heath insurance site gives me valuable information about many diseases and drugs.

-1	I am fairly confident that I have enough information, but there are times when the doctor uses terms that I don't understand.  During a hospitalization, there were many doctors talking quite a bit in medical terms I did not understand.  They would use acronyms and abbreviations which I had no idea what they were.

-1	"I feel like I have no problems reading, understanding, and processing basic health information provided to me when obtaining medical care/treatment. I'm able to understand and have enough medical background that I don't have many problems at doctor's offices/hospitals.  Pharmaceutical information can be trickier, but it and other complicated medical information which is harder to understand can also be ""googled"" nowadays, which I have confidence in."
1	I feel very capable of doing these things. I feel confidednt in my ability to obtain and understand information about my health care. I feel that I am able to trust my own reasoning and decision making. 
1	I feel I understand what my doctors are telling me about my health, if I didn't understand I would ask questions 
1	I am usually pretty good at keeping pace with medical forms. If I have a question I simply ask. If jargon is used I am not familiar with I just google it.
-1	I normally have my mother, who is retired nurse of over 30 years, help me fill in paperwork and ask questions during my diagnosis.
-1	I understand the medical conditions that I suffer from when the doctors are talking to me.  If not, I will ask my daughter who is a nurse.

-1	I mostly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I feel like sometimes the information is written in a way that it is difficult to understand if you don't have experience or training in the medical field.

1	I think that I can comfortably ask all the questions that need to be asked and digest all the information presented to me. I think that it is easy enough to find the information you need online before talking to other medical health professionals.
-1	I can generally make my own health decisions. The issue comes when doctors and nurses do not have time to give me all the information I need. I can understand most things just fine but if I do not have all the information I want then I can't make a good decision.
1	I think I am able to obtain a good deal of information on my own.  Searching the internet can be scary when it comes to health topics, but I do feel it is useful in getting broad ideas.  I also am not afraid to ask questions of health professionals.  I do know that not being able/willing to ask questions has been an issue for others in my family.
-1	I feel very confident in my ability. Generally the only time I will reach out or ask someone else for help understanding is if I have reason to believe they know a lot about the topic, and it is a very important procedure, or severe health issue.
-1	I can read all the information myself. Sometimes I need to ask the right professiol for help in understanding parts of it. I am capable of doing all of this for myself.
-1	I'd say that I'm moderately good at doing this but this is also due to recently becoming a lot more independent than in the past so I now do all of this stuff on my own. I make sure to ask questions and go to my doctors regularly and consistently so I can stay on top of my healthy and learn to live a healthy life. The thing that's hardest for me is healthy insurance because there are so many variances based on the type of doctor I see and what's covered and what isn't but that is a learning trend not associated with my health information directly.
1	I feel that I have a strong capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am very confident in my research ability and the internet has reliable sources of information when you know where to look. Outside of the internet, I have access to health professionals that I can speak with or make appointments to meet if I have any concerns regarding my health or any health related decisions.
1	I feel that i can understand it very well and, if not i will ask about it. Either to a doctor or a nurse about my medical issues.
-1	That is really difficult to say, but I dont feel I, myself have those abilities to make those decisions by myself because one wrong decision or choice and I could be paying for the rest of my life. It is really very serious and I need to be precise when choosing. I feel I have average skills to read and understand and dont feel thats strong enough to make tough decisions as this on my own. I really have made this mistakes in the past regarding my healthcare and I spent thousands of dollars trying to make right on it.
-1	When i ask the what i don't understand. So that i can understand what is going on. Than i do my research online.
-1	No I do not I often need help I usually do.not understand medical forms and things like that  .........
1	I would ask questions to the doctor about anything I didn't understand until I was satisfied that I knew what they where telling me.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information because I have a degree in the healthcare field. I also obtain knowledge by asking the important questions of my doctor. I also go a step further to research information provided to gain further understanding. I feel it is important to obtain a doctor that doesn't mind taking the extra time to make sure you understand the information they are providing. 
-1	I recently went to the doctor's a few days ago, this was my first time going back since I was 18. It's been nearly 6 years since my last visit, and I was given so many forms and documents to fill out, with some ambiguous questions that could mean this-or-that and I didn't want to make a mistake. It was slightly difficult, and kind of nerve-wrecking.
1	I feel that I am well equipped to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I am literate and can read information, process this information, and make informed decisions based up said information.
-1	I choose a doctor after going through online reviews. I make sure that the doctor is an expert in the corresponding field of medicine and has many years of experience. When the doctor prescribes a medicine, I make sure to understand the purpose of the medicine. Also, I go through the leaflet that arrives with each medicine to understand the side-effects of the medicine. I also ask the doctor whether I can heal without the medicine or whether it is mandatory that I take medicine to recover from an illness. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, I don't bother to buy the medicines prescribed.
1	I do a lot of research on health topics so that I can ask pertinent questions during a doctor visit.
-1	I definitely feel I have the capacity.  I might not know basic health information right off the bat,  but if it's explained to me in a nice, easy way i'll catch on fairly quickly and grasp what is being told to me.
1	I have a great deal of understanding basic heaalth info as well as services in regard to my and my son's medical care.
-1	I feel like I am able to do so with everyday medical decisions. If the medical decisions involve something rare or that I have not heard of, I tend to research the topic and seek advice before making a decision. 
1	Very confident that I can and do understand almost everything a doctor or other healthcare persons tell me. What I do not understand when they first tell me some thing then I do by the end of the second telling
-1	I really do not, it's usually above my head.  Sometimes, the doctors explanation is clear while other times is over my head. Alot of times u am just trying to get it off the office so I disregard a lot of the information they are telling me. Other times when it's very serious, I try to get all the information that i can or that is available. At those times it is important to get all the info I can.
1	feel I have a 90% capacity to garner fundamental health info & services necessary to make appropriate healthcare decisions.  I say this because altho' I keep a list of points to cover, those in the healthcare industry mean well, yet they are time-strapped, the environment is stressed, focus is not always laser-fine, thus things get missed, re-directed, misinterpreted, etc.  Teamwork makes the dream work, so I try, they try, we try, Pobody's Nerfect and 100% is not feasible.  I end up making additional appointments, physical concerns need to be re-evaluated, health problems sometimes exacerbate, co-payments multiply, etc.  Probable solutions.. ..processes re-investigated i.e. policy/procedure/protocol, but takes time, $$$, buy-in $ & who honestly has that?!?  
-1	I can obtain and process health information fully. The only instance I can think of where I can't is if I were to get bad news and be so overwhelmed and scared I would need a second person there.
1	I believe that I fully have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  I ask the questions that need to be asked to fully understand my situation.
-1	I think I have a moderate capacity to in obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. The times I need to help is when there are many technical terms being used or when information is complex and has many interwoven factors that must be taken into account. But overall, I think I do a fair job in understanding and processing these things. 
1	as a nurse, i feel i have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself and my family.
-1	I make sure to ask the doctor as he is explaining it to me, there are times when I feel like I am asking dumb questions because of the face the doctor makes. So I will just give up and wait to ask the nurse just before I leave the appointment. 
-1	Ability is about average. Can understand most. Rest can be explained easily just the medical terminology may need help to understand more.
1	I feel I can understand most basic healthcare information. Where I need help is when condition s occur that I have never had before. Under these circumstances I need a lot of help.
1	Im about as competent as you can get regarding health/exercise decisions. My knowledge is also very high in amino acids and their specific modes of action, replenishment cycles, and any cognitive/regenerative benefits that are associated with them. I'm also an active martial artist; i've seen about 20 years of habitual activity.
-1	Often forms are easily to fill out because they cover most concerns. Sometimes doctors do not ask if there are any questions and sometimes I forget to provide the questions. Mostly I understand or will look on  the web.
1	I am 100% confident that I can obtain, process and understand health information.  I do not have diminished mental capacity and I know mostly what doctors and nurses are talking about.  And if I don't know, I can certainly look it up online.
1	my Mother and Grandmother were registered nurses so I am very health/medical wise and I can always go online if I want to know more about a medical issue
1	I have a pretty good understanding.  I have studied anatomy and physiology and my mother works in a medical field so I have someone to call if I have questions.
-1	I feel like I have an average layman's understanding of health information. I don't think I have more knowledge or anything, but I do think that I can process and understand the information I am given, or information I am searching for sufficiently. Sometimes, though, things are out of my ability to understand, and I will either ask someone who I think is knowledgeable or just look it up myself.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand health information.  I feel very confident in my ability to do so.  I am not afraid to ask questions when I need clarifying, and I am always eager to take the time to read and learn about my own health conditions so that I can make the best decisions for myself possible.
1	I feel i can relate symptoms to known conditions and input my own variables into the equation to make sure everything is correct. I also sometimes rely on stories from people with similar conditions and things that didn't/did work for them.
1	i am of average intelligence and have no problem filling out forms and such. i do not need assistance. 
-1	Yes usually. I have the advantage that I worked in the health insurance industry 30 years ago so I can remember a FEW things...lol. 
1	Absolutely confident I can get information needed to do so.  Online resources and people will serve as primary go-tos.
1	I have a high  comprehension level when it comes to communicating with my health care provider or pharmacist.  They explain most things in basic terms and only used the big medical terms when there is no substitute.  I am extremely comfortable ask questions when i do not understand

-1	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information to a great extent. I am a nurse, so a lot of medical things I understand. But even being a health professional myself, I find some of the information is hard to understand, and I realize working as a nurse a lot of it is even harder for someone who has no medical background. 
1	I am confident that I am able to ask the necessary questions and have a good basic understanding of conditions I may have and services that may be recommended/required.

-1	It depends on the health condition I may have if I can fully understand it. Things like having a cold or a sprained ankle are somewhat simple to understand as oppose to a stomach condition like an ulcer. I would research online and ask for advice from family if I don't fully understand.
1	I am very capable to understand the information given me and when unsure I know mostly where to go to get the information needed to make any decisions I need at the time
1	At age 35 and my comprehension I feel I have 100% capacity in how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services that are for me and that are needed to make appropriate healthcare decisions. I am well versed in my care, health issues, medical issues, basic medicines and my insurance policies. If there is something I am unsure of I have no problems or difficulties in asking for an explanation.
1	I am still fully able to deal with doctors.  if I have any problems i have no problem asking.
-1	I don't feel like I understand basic health information to an extended capacity, merely because these things are very complicated and I rarely see or understand what the doctors and nurses advice. I'd love for a day when making good health decisions will be simplified and made easy for us to understand. 
-1	I have the ability to understand all the information given to me by doctors and nurses.  Sometimes doctors do move quickly and so obtaining all the information can be tricky, I sometimes have to keep a running list in my head of things to circle back to and sometimes I forget before I have time to circle back to them.
-1	I feel I have basic understanding of health information services needed to make appropriate health decisions by researching to get help me find answers.
-1	my ability to understand the language is moderate.  However such medical encounters are rare, because I am in excellent health.
1	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.

-1	I feel that I have an good amount to process my healthcare decisions but I do feel I need help in certain areas in the decision making.
-1	I can obtain it, and I understand it once I know the terms, but the medical lingo doesn't make sense most of the time and needs to be better explained 
-1	I feel slightly capable to do asses the information and services needed to make health decisions because of the access to the internet and access to nurses that can explain difficult medical terms or other bits words that I canât understand, So on my own I canât understand too much because of the medical terms but thanks to the internet and nurses they help me understand 
-1	I feel pretty good about any medical issues of my personal health issues. If I have any issues with anything my doctor always assist me or send me in the right direction

1	I feel I have the ability to find and understand information about any health conditions or services I might need. I know where to look for the information and what questions I need to ask.
1	I am fairly young still so I don't have a ridiculous amount of pills or supplements that I need to take a day so that is one thing I do not have to worry about. However even at my young age I have spent a good amount of time in a few different hospitals. Two times because of an injury and once because of a personal health problem. I never really had any trouble understanding what exactly I needed to do in order to prevent any further injury. The doctors explained to me clearly what I needed to do and even if I didn't understand something I had no trouble asking them directly what to do.
1	COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS THEN I ASK THEM TO RESOLVE ISSUES IN MY MIND.  THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING SO COMPLICATED THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON FROM TURP TO CLEANING OUT MY CAROTID ARTERY I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS DOING ON AND POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS FROM ED TO RETROGRADE EJACULATION.
-1	For the most part I feel like the information is available. But often the medical staff or doctor is rushed and they seem impatient and rushed.
1	I understand information very well. I can research anything I don't allow understand to make the best possible decision about my health.
1	I think when it comes to making decisions about my health, I feel that I'm fully capable of interpreting what the doctor's are saying and asking a lot of questions.  I tend to ask about alternatives to treatments depending on what the recommendations are.  I tend to trust what my doctor's say because I have a long standing history with them and they have a proven track record of having positive recommendations.  Any literary information I receive I'm fully capable of reading and understanding and usually do additional research myself.  The only thing I do is I have my husband take care of understanding the side effects of my medication so I don't get super anxious and dwell about the side effects.  I just let him know if I start feeling weird. I also make most of my decisions with my husband so that I have a support system.
-1	I can easily read and understand medical information on my own. Sometimes I may need a nurse to explain medical information or hospital jargon or language.

1	I do understand my health record because I do write and speak English. I am also a nurse so I can understand my record with no problem. I understand when the doctor talk to me about my health issue.
-1	I have the capacity to process basic health information when it is provided. But recent experience indicates I seldom get all information such as consequences and other options, nor repercussions of all options. 
1	I feel capable enough to process and understand most things. This includes the basic health information that I might need.
1	I think that I have the capacity to do those things. However, I do have issues with feeling that I am bothering my doctor. If I have a new health concern I don't usually call my doctor to inform them. If my appointment is taking too long, I worry that I shouldn't ask too many questions so she can get to her next patient. I don't call when I am having problems, and really only have appointments when I have to have my annual work done. 
-1	I think I would have a basic understanding on what procedure or task I would need to do obtain the information required. Processing and understanding the information might take some time and that requires me to do some external research to get a more general idea. A second opinion is also helpful.
1	I do research ahead of time so I can try to ask the best questions. I have good enough mental fortitude to process the information given to me and ask the right follow-up questions. I can think about things afterwards to help me best.
-1	I feel that I have the ability to understand and process most of what a health care professional has to tell me.  There are times when i am somewhat confused about what they are saying.  When this happens i try to ask them to explain in more detail so that i can comprehend what is going on.  I feel confident in filling out medical documents/forms when needed. But, again if there is any confusion i just ask for it to be clarified.  Now, at the pharmacy, i don't always ask all the questions that i should. I usually refer any questions about medication back to my doctor/nurse. 
-1	I feel I have full capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information. do not know what else to type
1	I feel confident that I make the correct decisions for my health because I typically understand what the doctor is telling me. I know what questions to ask if I don't understand them. I typically understand the brochures and my doctor is really helpful explaining things in lay men terms.
-1	I feel like I understand most of what is told to me regarding health information but sometimes I need help.  I rarely go to the doctor or get sick so I am not familiar with a lot of medical terminology or how processes work so I usually have to get either my wife or mother to help me understand things.  I usually consult someone if there is a big decision to make although that is extremely rare.
1	I feel as though I have great ability to read, understand and utilize basic health information to make medical decisions
-1	I believe I have the capacity to understand basic health information.  If I have basic health issues I am fine with understanding the risks and treatments.  If it is more complicated then I would tend to have someone with me who understands the medical field a little more than me or someone who has been through the process before.  I think that I can make decent informed decisions on healthcare needs and services.  
1	I am quite confident that I am capable of obtaining information from my primary care physician/through research, and understanding *most* of the health information that I retrieve...
-1	I am currently in the medical field and I have more than basic medical knowledge. I do have moments where I have to ask questions to get the understanding of things. I obtain knowledge quickly and process it just as fast for the best understanding of a situation at hand.
-1	I have an extensive medical history going back more than 20 years. Throughout that time I have been in situations that called for requests of my medical records and other related transcripts of my care. I also have been in need of more materials for my own understanding, as I have had more than 10 surgeries over the years and many procedures.  I have fulfilled the requests(for legal and Disability reasons) and supplied myself with what I needed too. I was in touch with anyone and everyone including, records department employees, APRNs, to people that are part of national health help organizations to the doctors themselves in order to obtain what I needed to get.
-1	I think that it is very easy to obtain any information that I need. I can easily call my doctor and ask to speak directly to him or her and I can get whatever I need.

1	I feel confident in my capacity to understand basic health information and services. I don't have any concerns in this area.

-1	I feel very unconfident. It's an unfamiliar environment and unfamiliar forms to me. Often I'm nervous anyways about being sick and my health declining so I do not think of questions I should ask at that time. I would want a friend or family member to accompany me or have assistance from personnel in filling out forms and documents before seeing the doctor. Often I'm in a rush to get in and get out so I don't take time to ask questions
-1	I feel like I have enough of an understanding of health issues that may arise that I can discuss options with my doctor or doctors. I also only go to doctors that I trust to help me make the right decisions. I have a couple close friends who are nurses so I can always talk to them if there's something I'm not completely sure of.

1	Based on the previously asked questions I fully understand and I am fully capable of answering and filling out medical forms. 
1	I think I have an above average ability to understand and process basic health information. This is due to my schooling in the biological sciences, in addition to my mother being a nurse with whom I may ask questions and have her explain the complex medical jargon that I may not understand. I also have the ability to google terms/conditions I do not know about and glean understanding about them from reputable sites.

-1	For the most part I think I have the full capacity. If its something that is really in depth I probably miss things and need someone to kinda help walk me thru it.

1	OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING HONEST AND DIRECT WITH THE DOCTOR .   THEY CANNOT HELP IF THEY DONT KNOW EVERYTHING

I sometimes will ask a few questions but by the end I am shaking my head like I fully understand when actually I have no clue. 
1	I'm pretty confident with my understanding and basic knowledge of the health information, and I do rely quite a bit on online information, if I didn't understand something even after I ask my doctor, I spend a considerable amount to research more online. It also helps that I have a couple doctors in my family as well as a good friend of mine who is also a doctor (in addition to my own doctor) so I talk to them quite a bit whenever I have questions, although sometimes it can get confusing to get multiple answers from different people at the same time (one may say I need more meds for my cholesterol, another says i don't need that much, etc).

1	I think I am perfectly capable. I've never really needed help filling out or understanding medical documents

The health industry has gotten a lot more complicated in all levels of health. From making simple appointments to diagnosing, to the right health care needs and all of the complications with insurance , how to pay and how much health care cost.

-1	I think I have the capacity.  Sometimes I do not know what is wrong with me.  Sometimes I think the doctor or practitioner is in a rush.
1	I feel that I have a good grasp of medical terminology and lingo. My grandparents and father have all had vast dealings with the medical community, which makes me feel comfortable and familiar with what happens at a hospital or a doctor's office. Medical professionals don't seem as intimidating and medical procedures as scary as they once did.

Once I have information from trusted sources, I do feel confident exploring, understanding, and responding to it. I appreciate the expanding information available online, especially that increasingly provided by insurers.
1	I feel I am better than average.
-1	I pretty much understand most of the time, sometimes I do have to ask extra questions.

1	I have no problems at all. I understand what the doctor tells me. I ask what I don't know.the doctor explains in terms i understand.
-1	I am confident that i will understand all medical information.  I sometimes will need help in knowing what needs to happen with anything that may occur.
-1	As long as they speak in layman's terms I have you difficulty understanding the complications come in when they use words I don't comprehend.
1	I have never had any problems with reading what the doctors or nurses write down.   I have never had any problems understanding what doctors or nurses have told me.
-1	I still can under stand basic things about my health if the doctor takes time to explain it Some times they hurry too much and have office help explain it and they do not do a good job. And it helps if they explain in basic terminology which often they do not.It depends a lot on the doctor to make sure you know what they told you to do.
1	I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health info. At times I can't think of questions to ask, but overall I am competent.

-1	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a pretty good degree.  I am still somewhat young, so I haven't had a lot of occasions of going to a clinic or hospital on my own.  I am still pretty used to going with my parents.
