0.822200	"I am a relatively intelligent person so I'm confident in my ability to process information in general. The problem arises when medical terminology is used and not explained. This is particularly true of lab tests where I may be told ""X is high"", but not told why that is or what that means for my overall health.

I dont need a word that uses every letter in the alphabet twice. A lot of stuff uses too much lingo and can make you feel inadequate. Makes you not want to ask the question because ohh this person doesnt know what ""dnkfnepehdnlopidkodnghineocian"" means. Why are you wasting my time if you dont know that.

0.588900	Well, I'm not mentally disabled. I therefore *can* do it. I don't sometimes understand medical terminology, which for some reason medical personnel seem wont to use when speaking to non-medical personnel, and often I can't be bothered to have a conversation about it.

I put my trust in them that they have my health and well being in their best interest but sometimes I wonder, especially with the billing they are going to send to my health insurance career, it might be a time where they want to add some dollars in their pocket. Luckily I have my wife who is a nurse who can explain everything in a much slower manner once they leave. This is very helpful because then I have time to process what exactly is going on and then we can come up with the best possible decision regarding my health.

0.583300	I feel I slightly have a good capacity to understand basic health information, as well as to obtain and process it. I've had to figure it out on my own and family hasn't been that helpful. When I go to my health insurance page, it doesn't explain things that well, so I have to make a decision on my own again.

0.783300	An average person does have difficulty filling out medical forms. I am only knowledgeable in this due to the fact that I have an associates degree in medical billing and coding.

0.633300	I think i have a reasobly good capacity to understand and process health service information. I might need some help with certain things when plain language isn't used, or when my anxiety disorder cripples me to the point that I have trouble processing information, but during those times I have either my mother or the internet to consult for help. 
0.638900	I think I have a decent grasp on how to navigate the health industry. The Terminology is confusing at times but I think I can understand for the most part. 
0.816700	I feel I am very capable of making medical decisions. If I don't understand something I will ask the doctor to explain it in a way I can understand. I can also ask them to show me on a picture of organs or part of the body it pertains to. 
0.900000	I feel well-equipped to understand the materials given to me. My educational background is in Psychology and Pre-Medicine, which means I've taken a good amount of coursework in the sciences including biology, chemistry, and (obviously) psychology. This material challenged my reading and information-processing capabilities and has taught me to understand medical information more thoroughly, though I am no physician!
0.916667	I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information and make basic health decisions. 
0.827778	I have the full capacity to understand any health information and services in order to make clear decisions
0.688900	I am a pretty fast learner and most of the time I am able to understand all the medical forms. Sometimes I will have someone go over it with me to explain in more shortened terms
0.900000	I feel that I have the capability to understand the written material that is given to me when I go to the doctor. Although there are a very few times that I don't understand but I seek help, usually at the front desk of the doctors office and they explain to me in detail. It is very important to me that I understand all the medical papers about my health because I want to make sure I take the correct measures in case of an illness. I would not want to misunderstand and later on deal with a worse health issue. I would rather ask even if it means asking a lot of questions.
0.544400	I feel that the degree is difficult. I think most information is presented in a manner mentioned to confuse patients about what the real cost involved are.
0.694444	I think I understand most of the basic health information. But sometimes when it comes to services. It get kind of hard to find appropriate health decisions.
0.916667	When the doctor are nurse explain what need to be done,I make sure I ask all the question,that going to let me know,what have to be done,to make sure my health ,be better
0.850000	Yes, I can still understand and process all the health information that my doctor or nurse give to me. If there is something I don't understand, I ask. I know how to use my medical and dental websites and all that entails.
0.872200	When necessary, I am fully able to obtain and understand health information and medical services.  There have been a few instances where difficulties arose (with a specific dentist who was hesitant to provide accurate information because he was pushing for unnecessary and expensive dental work), but these situations have been exceedingly rare over the course of my life.
0.694444	i like the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions and its easy and things like that and it makes its easy to do things and stuff
0.888900	"I have no problem understanding health information that is given to me.  The problem is when doctors are more concerned with a ""treat and street"" philosophy merely going through the motions to check off boxes for insurance companies than actually LISTENING to patients and taking the time to ask the questions that need to be answered in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  Patients often do not know that a symptom is just that so when a doctor fails to asks the right questions there will likely not be an accurate diagnosis.  Another issue is when a doctor blatantly ignores my questions.  How many ways to I have to ask the most basic question of what does this diagnosis mean?  More often than not it's just easier to go home and search webmd or the Mayo Clinic website.  Problem with that is I generally end up with even more unanswered questions.  Ultimately I am quite capable of understanding information when it is provided and if my questions are answered with more than a couple of words.  (The correct answer to ""what does the thyroid do?"" is NOT ""Pep"" and after a look of disbelief ""You know, energy"")"
0.855600	I believe I have the full capacity. I've never had problems before.
0.755556	i can understand health information about me or any of my family members  I have been through a lot of health issues
0.916667	I have all I need. No one needs to assist me in answering any health questions. I am fully capable of taking care of myself.
0.850000	I have some experience in a health-related career. I feel fairly well-equipped to understand common terminology, as well as some of the more common services that a provider would recommend.
0.900000	I understand what the doctor tells me to do I just don't like taking pills that's all doctors do is give pills to everyone 
0.483333	I have no problems with these health issues and services, regardless so why do you ask? This is ridiculous. 
0.644444	I feel like i do have the capacity go answer questions asked to me about my health. I can process information very well and answer thwm all correctly
0.866700	I am fully capable of understanding and obtaining my basic health information. I can do so in person and also online with my healthcare account. It shows my lab results and general health information.
0.888900	I can almost always understand and remember what a doctor or nurse tells me. I understand all basic medical terminology as well as some more advanced terms.
0.705600	I think that in general I am able to get the help that I need in understanding health information and services. At the hospitals that I go to, quite often the information that the doctor conveys is backed up by written reading material. My main trouble comes with pharmacy medications. It is not always clear how to go about taking it - for example, suppose I want to switch from taking something in the evening to taking it in the morning, can I do that? Additionally,  suppose I suspect something is a side effect of pill X, then i hate going online to figure it out because its just not the same as seeing a doctor. 
0.633333	I really do not, it's usually above my head.  Sometimes, the doctors explanation is clear while other times is over my head. Alot of times u am just trying to get it off the office so I disregard a lot of the information they are telling me. Other times when it's very serious, I try to get all the information that i can or that is available. At those times it is important to get all the info I can.
0.883300	I feel I understand the information properly most of the time. I can use the information to make a decision.
0.916667	I have no trouble understanding, if I do I ask for a better explanation.The they will explain in better terms for me to understand.
0.855556	I am very involved with my health and the impact that the medical profession has upon it.  I do research and take that information and apply it to what a Dr. recommends and form my own opinion on the information on hand.
0.766667	Documents are important because if you don't understand it for any reason you can always go back ANd inform yourself and at the worst case contact your doctor for more information.
0.472222	Yes I feel I understand what the doctor's tell me enough to get by. If not I look up the information on the internet and read about it. 
0.550000	It's kind of difficult to answer.  I have many conditions that are still unknown, so i cannot get actual answers very often, not to the fault of doctors or nurses most of the time.
0.916667	there is nothing wrong with my brain. I can read, listen and understand as good as ever. if I have a question I ask it.
0.783300	I feel like I have a fairly average capacity to process and understand basic health information as long as it doesn't get too technical about the medicinal or diagnostic aspect of it. I do feel fairly confident in my ability to make decisions based on this information. I feel more hesitant about my ability to obtain such information, as due to anxiety I find it difficult to ask relevant questions in real time. 
0.733300	I think I can easily fill out the health forms but it's difficult finding a doctor that is covered by insurance and affordable to get the answers needed, so I always feel like I am doing the bare minimum to maintain rather than actually getting help.
0.711100	I feel that I have the capacity almost entirely. Everythime I have gone to the Doctor I have left feeling confident that I understood what was going on.
0.916667	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services given to me by a health physician because I listen and I ask questions about things I don't understand so that I can understand them.
0.833333	I usually understand what is being said.  If I don't, I ask them to clarify.  I don't really have any problems.
0.838900	pretty completely. It is not that hard and if some terms are not understood I can google it. 
0.716667	I'm very concern about my health and healthcare. And I watch what I eat some times I can walk and some days I can't walk at all
0.916667	I can understand mostly everything and am capable of making my own health decisions. I have a good grasp of the English language and good communication skills.
0.750000	i have to ask the doctors a few questions. the service that i normally get it always great services. my nurse that i go to also help me with all the questions that i have for them. they would tell me what i need to eat right and drink.
0.794400	I believe I am fully capable of understanding basic health information and services needed to make health decisions for myself. If I am unclear about something, I will research it myself or ask others for help or I will seek understanding from a health care professional. 
0.761100	I feel absolutely competent in understanding and processing basic health information to make decisions about my health. However, finding or obtaining information that will truly be helpful to my health is difficult. Intense research is often necessary for basic information. 
0.811100	I feel like it isn't that hard to get clear information on what I need. Even if I don't bother asking someone, Google is right there to provide additiol information.
0.794400	I feel that I have the ability to make most of the basic common health information and services that I may need. Outside of that, I think depending on the issue it would be much more difficult to obtain what I needed by myself. 
0.622200	Confident. I feel confident in making my health decisions. I'm still fairly young and healthy. I know yo ask questions when something is important. I forget information, but I know what to do and say to function and survive. 
0.900000	I have been in and out of the hospital since my 20s. I have had cancer twice and other problems that has made me aware of many things in the medical field. 
0.583333	Not well enough. Need better information. More visitations and help. More written easy steps for adults and children....
0.883300	I think that for the most part i understand what the doctor tells me concerning information about my health, sometimes if something is written down it could be hard to understand because of the hand writing and then i would ask  to explain to me what is written.  
0.705556	well i fell as i know myself better than others so that why i could fill out medicail papers with no problem
0.744400	I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions based on my own health curiosity and a detailed family tree of health issues. 
0.872200	I feel pretty confident, but mostly because I have done my own research. Honestly doctors seem to fly through visits any more. Over scheduled and over worked. I don't blame them, I know it is but a clog in the system. 
0.644400	I feel like I do.  I just don't understand some of the terms the doctors/nurses use.  I understand most of what they are saying. It when you are at the doctor you're (at least I am) a little scared so your brain doesn't process like normal. 
0.916700	I believe I can acquire all available information about making a health decision, and then evaluate and understand  that information in a way that leads to the best possible decision.
0.788900	I believe I have the willingness to learn all that I need to about my health and any appropriate measures that I could take to address any health issue I have. I'm willing to dig into details and be thorough about it.
0.872222	Yes I think I could do that with out help and I have been doing it in the past I never had any problem before.
0.861111	I am fully capable of understanding written and verbal information. I have no problems understanding basic health information as well as the services needed to make the appropriate health decisions. 
0.833333	they tell you what you are diagnose with you ask question and get immediately result and thing you may not onthe other hand such as cancer you start hurting. place on your body starting to bruise yu dont know how but certain you know the answer. bang out of the blue
0.616667	i feel like i have a large capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information when i need to make health decisions -- I am able to talk with nurses when i need and i am also able to set up appointments online which makes it easier
0.644400	Being in the medical system can be difficult and confusing. There are quite a lot of forms to fill out and its difficult when you are sick. I feel like i need more resources and information in order to make the appropriate decisions with my healthcare. The standards of care vary and some medical professionals recommend things that others do not.
0.722200	I feel I have a pretty good capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I would say I am confident in this area about 85% of the time. Sometimes I need some assistance from other health care workers or more information before making a decision. Usually, in these cases, I am able to get the help I need.
0.866700	im young and i have the patience and the knowledge to be able to deal with anything medical related 
0.855556	I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information which is explained by my doctor or in basic medical reports.  I am unable to understand test results that have shorthand, acronyms etc. that are specific to the medical field.  I do, however ask my doctor to explain any test results or language that I do not undferstand.
0.833333	I have a strong capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health info. I am well read, and 9 times out of 10 can understand fairly complex ideas.
0.822200	Even if I don't initially understand all the information, I try to ask questions to help me understand further. I also have a close family member who is a registered nurse who has helped me at times. I try to use good resources on the internet for information.
0.733300	I think I can understand the information well enough to get by but there are times I don't understand what doctors verbally explain to me. I'm not great at asking for clarification either.
0.916667	I feel very confident in making appropriate health decisions because I am well educated.  If my wife or I are undecided about a condition, we consult with our daughter and/or son-in-law who are both physician assistants.
0.483333	I do, I am just scared of looking or sounding dumb. I know I am not a doctor or a physician but sometimes when I ask questions I feel like they look at me like I should already know the answers or something. 
0.816667	I feel like I can make all appropriate decisions because I have no problem asking healthcare professionals questions about anything I don't understand. I also fully trust my doctor and nurses to give me the best advice.
0.916667	I have full capacity to understand and make appropriate decisions about health information and services
0.672200	I feel like I have an above average understanding of medical terms and technology, although I'm not in med school or anything.  I feel that a lot of the information available assumes that we are doctors and isn't really put into terms that the typical person can understand.  Some information is missing too, like how nasal steroids can cause dependence and shouldn't be used for more than a week or two.  These spurts of missing information can lead to very misinformed decisions.  I feel like the medical community could provide better resources.
0.727778	I can advocate for myself in person, over the phone and through documented communication including email or letter.
0.805556	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate decisions, especially because I am in very close contact with  my doctors regarding my health an information for things that keep me healthy.
0.916667	I am an RN, therefore, I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and  understand based health information and services that I need.
0.916667	I am a retired RN and so I understand all the medical terms a Dr. or nurse might use and if need be I ask them appropriate questions.
0.916700	I have an Associate's Degree in Medical Information Technology and have taken many classes related to the medical field. I feel that gives me more of an capacity to understand information about my health. Even stuff I don't know, I feel I can still understand when my doctor explains it. I am always able to research things I'm not sure about, but that doesn't happen often.
0.900000	I ask a lot of questions when I visit my doctor and have follow up questions if I don't understand his answer.
0.633300	While I am reasonably confident in my abilities to understand, there are times when doctors and health care professionals speak with too much complicated jargon. It is helpful to have someone with me to ask the questions that I don't even know I should be asking.
0.916667	I am a person who constantly reads and wants to learn things that I do not already know. I do not have a problem with asking someone to explain something I do not know so I can understand.
0.783333	I am pretty good at understanding documents.  The form directions could be written better though.  Sometimes it is not obvious where to put the information I fill out.

0.411100	I can defiantly understand the concept of hospital services and health decisions.But,somebody has to help me out a little bit. 
0.827778	I understand the medical procedures that may be necessary for me but sometimes I don't understand why. For example, there is one procedure in particular that I need to get but I really don't understand why I need it. 
0.833300	Yes I understand the basic information needed to make appropriate health decisions, If I have questions doctors usually explain things in a way I can understand even though I am not in the medical field. 
0.600000	I have the capacity for the most part but every now and again I find myself needing some assistance with not just filling out paperwork but even understanding pill bottles and other medicine. It can be mentally draining but something I've accustomed to. For the most part, I understand what I need to but it doesn't mean I don't need the help every blue moon.
0.777800	I feel I know just as much as the regular ordiry person does in regard to medical questions, and paperwork. I know sometimes questions aren't asked due to worrying about feeling dumb about something.
0.711111	I CAN DO EVERYTHING AND I UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION, WHEN I HAVE A PROBLEM AND I GO TO THE HOSPITAL I READ THE INFORMATION IF I HAVE A QUESTION THEN I TALK WITH DOCTOR OR NURSE
0.916667	  i am very health smart and i use the computer for years to read about many of my own conditions and many others.I am very interested in medical issues and reading on them.

0.888889	I have full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I can successfully make health decisions

0.916700	I feel very confident in my ability to understand necessary health information. I also am competent on researching symptoms via the internet.  Overall, while I am not an expert by any stretch, I feel like I have a very good grasp on my health and what impacts my health.
0.916667	I have no problems obtaining information, processing or understanding what is necessary to make appropriate health decisions. I have access to a computer to help with research, family and friends to reach out to and various health workers to discuss my concerns.
0.916700	I have been in situations where I needed to find out as much info as possible and I did. I have also been the person that was needed to get the info for someone else, so I know that I will ask about anything I am not sure of and that I can research and question the Dr's based on that research. 
0.833300	I feel that I am fully capable of getting and understanding the information.  I also know how to ask the right questions and to ask for help if need be
0.600000	I feel very accomplished in reading or assessing medical instructions it is just sometimes the professional answers are closed off due to they can not admit or deny what i ask since it is something they are not willing to discuss
0.855600	I feel that I do have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services that are needed for the right health decisions. I do feel that some of the answers given to me by doctors is very ambiguous and vague. I feel it's becoming more and more difficult to get a definitive answer and treatment plan by many doctors. In this way, I do find it difficult, because there seems to be a lack of concern in what I'm asking about in certain situations. I often have to rely on doing a lot of research myself, which can be difficult when trying to discern certain medical journals. 
0.738889	A pretty strong degree. My mother works in healthcare, so she has set me up with a pretty strong understanding of medical terminology, and anytime I don't understand something, I call her to clarify. 
0.744444	I ALWAYS WRITE DOWN MY CONDITIONS, BLOOD SUGAR, BLOOD PRESSURE ETC, SO THAT THEY CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING

0.916700	I believe I have better capability than the average person to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I am very good at picking up key information that is needed to make important health decisions. 
0.883300	In general I feel that I can understand everything the doctors tells me about my health. At times when it comes to my husband's health conditions it is more complicated so I do ask my son to accompany us to the doctor to make sure that I do not miss anything that I need to know. I think as I get older sometimes doctors treat us differently like they do not have faith in us understanding them and that gives me doubt at times even though I do everything I need to do in my life without any problems. But as far as basic health instructions and decisions I feel very confident at this point with regards to my health. My husband on the other hand hates going to the doctor and turns his doctor off without listening to anything he says because he does not want to hear and doesn't believe most of it. 
0.716667	Yes I do feel that I obtain the capacity to read and understand basic health information, due to completing school for Medical Assistant and learning from my own personal health issues.
0.838900	I have a biology background and a little bit of hospital lab experience.   I feel like this gives me an above average ability to process and understand what doctors are saying and to research.  I will still ask questions though if there is any doubt.
0.855556	I HAVE NO PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION OR SERVICES TO MAKE HEALTH DECISIONS,BECAUSE I AM CONFIDENT IF I'M ASKED I CAN DO SO WITH SOUND MIND.
0.916700	I always prepare ahead of time before seeing my PCP. I take my notes with me and she always asks me, at the end of our time together, if I have asked all the questions I want to ask. I feel secure in my ability to understand my doctors instructions, her answers to my questions, and I feel secure in making health decisions for myself. However, If I have any doubts, and certainly before I make any major decisions such as possible surgery, I always consult my oldest daughter, and if necessary, my other children as well. 
0.866667	I am only 58 years old and not senile. I ran my own business for 10 years so I am not uneducated. I understand medical terminology quite well and have been a caregiver for my disabled husband for 25 years so I am familiar with all kinds of medical jargon. If I do not understand something, I ask the dr. I go online to look up things if I feel the need to. Regardless of what any doctor says, I know my own body so I often know what is best for it. For example, If I have any dairy, I get horrible mucus and have to use my inhaler more often. I've told the Dr this several times and he keeps telling me that dairy won't cause that Hogwash! It DOES cause it so I avoid dairy
0.816667	I am confident that I can get the information that I need to understand any medical information provided by the doctor or nurse. 
0.916667	I am 100% aware of my needs and wants, I do not suffer from any kind of dementia or other memory loss

0.916667	I have the absolute capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic and advanced medical information
0.694400	Because of my anxiety, sometimes its hard for me to further questions professiols to properly convey what's wrong or to get the full instructions that I need. Especially if they seem annoyed or like they're stuck up it increases this. 
0.861111	i am perfectly capable of doing that and have no problems with it. I always read everything I get, especially before signing anything. 
0.916667	I feel very comfortable talking to my medical providers about my own conditions and treatments. I believe I understand completely what is being said, even if I have to ask follow-up questions.
0.883300	As a young, intelligent woman who has no mental health issues that would preclude me from basic literary understanding (ex: dementia)  I feel that I have very good capability to read and understand basic health information.  When a medical professional gives me materials, I read and understand them just fine.  And when I have questions about my health or medical procedures, I can usually find the answers I need on the internet.  Then, if there is some question specific to only my situation, I can ask my doctor and receive a suitable response in a timely fashion.  
0.727800	I believe in understanding documents and filling out forms I find it easy to process and understand. It is when I need more information and have to ask the questions where I do stumble and or tend to ask the wrong things or word it weirdly. I have horrible social anxiety which does not help one bit.
0.783333	I can understand basic health information and services and obtain and process the information. I can make appropriate health decisions.
0.850000	I feel I'm better than the average person at being able to process and understand basic health information. My mind is still sharp and active and I study about my conditions in order to understand them and their causes. I know that many people my age are unable to do the same.

0.811111	I am educated person and i make sure i.get the facts. I.know how to ask questions and to let the doctor or physician know when I'm not understanding something. 
0.566667	I feel with my limited exspirance and novice knowledge, my level of medial understanding is minimal. 
0.705600	At least decent in the form of if I do not know I will ask and I do follow my Doctors instructions. 
0.883300	I think I am fully capable of understanding and obtaining my basic health information. I am also fully capable of making decisions about treatment for any health problem.
0.800000	I think that I understand basic health information fairly well.  If there is something I don't understand I ask for it to be explained to me
0.916667	I think my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to help make the appropriate health decisions are great. I usually ask question when trying to compare prescription but over all since I graduated with a bachelor degree in health science I know enough to understand.
0.916700	I feel that I have a very high capacity to get and understand what health information I need. I learn quickly, have a good memory for facts, am very capable of research, and I'm able to look at my condition objectively without letting anxiety or fear get in the way of me understanding what I need to understand.
0.833300	I feel like I am very much capable and knowledgeable enough to make basic health decisions. I feel like that because every time I go to my doctors office they always answer my questions and if I have any problems they are just one phone call away.

0.588889	It seems as of the doctor's do not talk to the patient so that they can understand what they are talking about. It would be nice if they would speak to the patient in terms that the patient can understand.

0.794400	I feel like I can understand the information given to my by healthcare professionals, however, I still find it nerve-wrecking to ask all the questions that I need.  Sometimes I feel like the physician is in a rush to get to the next patient and thus, I feel like I'm being a burden by asking too many questions.  The physician seems unwilling to truly find out the source of my issues.
0.916667	I do not have any problems at all in regards to understanding any health concerns, or anything that goes along with it. I have worked as an LPN for almost 25 years and am quite knowledgeable about health care.,

0.844400	"I am about 95% proficient at processing the information needed. This is in part due to ... sorry ... being intelligent, my family history to see trends and what happens when you don't treat illnesses, and knowing that ""if you don't understand, ask, instead of walking out."" "
0.538900	Most of the time I feel like doctors and nurses are too rushed and I don't want to bother them with things that they seem to think I should already know. Many test results are too complicated to understand anyway and I feel like I could just look them up later instead of wasting their time. 
0.883333	I feel I understand everything I'm asked when i'm  talking to my doctor. When my doctor ask questions i fully understand with I'm asked. 
0.827800	I think I have the the capacity to understand basic health information, but sometimes I don't think of the right questions to ask until I'm home and I realize I should have asked more questions while I was there.  Then it's too late and I search the web for information which is maybe not as good as getting information specific to my needs from my doctor.
0.916700	As long as they don't use technobable only understandable by nurses and doctors I don't have problems understanding what is told to me (or read about it). The problem is (for me) to get them to give me the information (that seems to be something they don't want to give).
0.900000	I have the knowledge to understand things that medically going on with me or around me and if it's something I do not understand I have the knowledge to ask questions
0.827800	I received an Associates degree in Pre Nursing, so I have an above average understanding of medical terms. Also I read a lot of medical magazines mainly my moms as she is a nurse and receives many scholarly nursing magazines. Another reason is because the medical field is my biggest interest and I love to learn about it whether it be medical conditions or any other related content.  
0.850000	I feel pretty confident in my ability to perform these tasks. If I have any doubts, I always make sure I get the information straight before I leave the office. 
0.700000	I think I have the capacity to understand things when they are explained to me.  Knowing the relevant information is another thing altogether.  Sometimes I don't know which questions to ask.  I put my faith in the professiols and hope for the best, although I wish I had more control/knowledge of the situation.  
0.811111	I understand the disease I am diagnosed with and I make the doctor explain it the I will understand so that I don't get confused.
0.705600	I feel like as long I knew the definition of basic medical terminology than I would be able to understand somewhat. It would provide a good foundation of comprehension.
0.672200	I have general familiarity of general, basic medical terms, however, I don't feel great about filling out forms. I tend to overthink them and am always concerned that I'm going to fill something out wrong, and have it negatively impact me in the future. 
0.844400	I am knowledgeable in the terms and words used so I can answer and understand what they ask or am able to comprehend the material. The doctors and nurses usually let me know of the situation in an easy to understand fashion so I am not confused. 
0.883300	Because of a disease I was diagnosed with over 20 years ago, I've learned a lot of terminology related to medical health.  I'm not afraid to ask my doctors questions or for thorough explations if necessary.  It's been my experience that doctors are always very willing to take the time to explain. My husband has EMT training and his knowledge helps sometimes.
0.761100	For the most part I feel that I do have that capacity, but it honestly depends on the doctor or nurse that I am dealing with. I feel that many doctors and nurses are so strapped for time that they are not as willing to listen to whatever questions I have, and therefore many things end up getting lost through the cracks. 
0.916700	I have rarely, if ever, had trouble understanding medical info given to me, either in writing or verbally from my medical doctors and their staff. If I ever do have questions, or am unsure about a certain part of the information, I have always been sure to ask questions until I fully understood and felt comfortable.
0.800000	I am of sound mind and I can understand what I being told or what I am reading. If i don't understand what I'm being told I will ask the right questions if I don't get the answers I need I will get a second opinion.
0.916667	I am able to understand exactly what doctors explain to me enough to make informed decisions. I am able to assist doctors in the regards to all my health issues.
0.916667	I understand about my health problem and understand what the doctor tell me I process my health to the fulles

0.838900	I am very confident to understand basic health information and services. I have a lot of experience at hospitals and doctor's offices. 
0.777800	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I also know that it's not always easy or something you can accomplish in a timely manner. Health centers and hospitals differ, as do health professionals. I have a primary care doctor who is unfortunately overworked and somewhat difficult to speak with to the extent that I need to. On the other hand, when I had a fracture almost two years ago, all the specialists I saw after I left the hospital were very forthcoming with help and information, and they listened well. Their assistants were superb. However, my experience in the ER was terrible. Really terrible, especially while being in the midst of trauma. So I feel that my capacity to obtain what I need has been very uneven.
0.872200	I am quite confident in my capacity to obtain, process and understand this information, I am far less confident that medical professionals will give me the correct information or that they even possess the correct information in the first place.
0.722222	I have my daughter to help me. If I don't understand something she helps me to figure it out.  She also goes to my doctor appointments with me so I don't forget any question I needed to ask the doctor at my appointment. 
0.833333	When I do visit a doctor, I do feel like I understand paperwork and conversations fairly well.  However, I tend to avoid going to the doctor due to cost, and even I do visit, I may not completely follow up on certain concerns because of the potential cost involved.  This is the only regard in which I feel that I do not have the capacity to obtain health services.
0.744400	I feel like I am able to adequately obtain, process and understand basic health information.   Often I need to research these things but I am good at using things like the internet to research and filter the good information from the bad so even if I need to look at mutiple sources I am usually able to find a source that makes things easy to understand.
0.800000	I am fairly confident that I understand basic health information. I ask questions if I am not clear about something.
0.705556	sometimes is very diffucalt to understand about illness need to have additional infformation so go to website or google to find additional information sometimes need to have second opinion
0.711111	I am confident that i will understand all medical information.  I sometimes will need help in knowing what needs to happen with anything that may occur.
0.805600	I just do
0.872200	Extremely confident.  I have a basis in A&P/medical in high school/college so i understand most things.  If i don't, my doctor or nurse is always willing to further explain to me.
0.900000	I am very capable of making my own decisions, reading and understanding information as well as obtaining and researching information pertaining to my health.
0.677800	I feel like I can understand a lot of things and that I have gotten better at asking questions. However, I am bad at asking questions when they are about a new topic. For example, if I made an appointment to talk about issue A, but I also have issue B, I will only talk about issue A. I also do not understand health insurance information well.
0.805600	"I have a curious mind so anything I may not understand I will be sure to ask my doctor to explain. I have the capacity to understand much of what I'm told. My only barrier to understanding health information is anxiety which leads me to have a tendency toward ""burring my head in the sand."""
0.916667	I feel that I have 100% capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I am fully able to make to make the appropriate health decisions, based on any information from my doctor.

0.777778	I think I understand basic health information and If I don't I always ask my doctor or nurse or look it up on-line
0.766667	I like to look it up on my phone to fully understand what they are telling me. Because, they will use the technical words
0.883333	I cqn understand basic health information and services quite well. I will ask for assistance understanding jargon often used by newer doctors and I always make sure I am comfortable with my understanding of the information given to me.
0.766667	More then most people. I've been doing it for years. I've been helping my dad fill out the forms for himself and my husband too
0.661100	I feel the for the most part I have the capacity and understanding to fully grasp what is going on. Still, there are many medical terms that I just don't understand and it's very difficult for me to know 100% what's going on.
0.861111	I understand the health Decisions very well and they questions are very understandable ands agreeable 
0.700000	I have been able to make good choices so far in life.  I expect that I will continue to make good choices.  If I doubt myself, that's typically when I ask for someone else's opinion.  If I do not understand something, I typically would call my doctor for advice, or use the internet to expand my knowledge on certain subjects.
0.761111	I feel I am well equipped to understand my own health and information.  I feel I am better suited to tell a doctor about me than he is to tell me about myself.
0.850000	I can do some things on my own, some others I need help with. It's not always that I could understand medical terms and instructions but I try my best. I access websites, contact my doctor, ask my family, and I just try to be patient when dealing with information.
0.816667	the only time i have a problem understanding what the doctor is talking about is when they diagnose me with something i've never heard of, can't pronounce, or spell, which leads me to not believe what they are saying
0.816667	extremely well....My doctor is a wonderful man and is a great aid in helping me to understand my health conditions
0.916667	I have never had any difficulty reading and understanding any forms or medical situations.I research any new conditions as they arrise.
0.900000	Most official forms are developed for the comprehension of a 9-grader and only require limited clarification related to terminology or language used that's specific to the medical community.  That said, I do not have any concerns or require assistance when processing documentation or speaking with clinicians.
0.722200	I mostly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in an independent way. The only times I have difficulty with this are when I have questions about procedures, terminology, and timelines regarding certain conditions, procedures, etc. The ability to make appropriate health decisions is very important for me to be able to do. If I do have difficulty obtaining, process, or understanding any health information, I make sure to ask lots of questions and get my concerns addressed.
0.900000	I understand basic health information very well. I also have enough intelligence to do further research if I need to/
0.916667	I am a retired RN so I have no trouble understanding what is being said to me by my physician and I have enough background knowledge to know what questions to ask to fully understand
0.672200	I would say that for the most part I do have all the information, tools available to myself when I need them or need an explation of something. My current doctor is very caring and explains things well! He even tells me to ask questions at all times if I have them. When it comes to filling out a form and I do not have confidence I can always ask him or the staff for help.
0.761100	I have the capacity to process basic health information when it is provided. But recent experience indicates I seldom get all information such as consequences and other options, nor repercussions of all options. 
0.650000	I am a person that tends to read a lot about health issues. Not only do I talk to octors but I also o my own research that way I can understand at least the basics when it comes to meical terms. That way I can make better decisions.
0.761100	As an academic who lives close to a hospital, I feel that I am uniquely fortunate in my ability to obtain, process, and comprehend basic health information because I have research resources at my disposal to help understand concerns and experts to consult nearby.
0.900000	I can easily obtain and understand health information provided to me by medical professiols. Usually the medical condition is explained multiple times by the nurse and doctor. Also, they usually give you educatiol literature to take home and read. 
0.650000	I can understand health information very confidently. I know what a lot medical terms mean 
0.844400	English is my tive language so I understand the forms I'm filling out and the conversations I'm having with my doctors.  I'm also relatively young, and do not have dimentia or other type of mental processing blocks.

0.916700	"I have had to learn to advocate for myself with all healthcare people and specialists. About a fourth of those people are apathetic, overworked, inattentive, abusive and/or neglectful. I realized a long time ago that they mostly guess ""conditions"" without proper testing. I have been given ""band-aid"" medicine for decades and much of that medication has caused me further harm. I will no longer take anything without further testing and more proof that it will actually improve my quality of life. "
0.783300	I can easily see that I am able to obtain health information from my doctor. I would be able to process the information that I was given and if I'm not able to understand it all, then I can ask the doctor to explain it more simpler.
0.677800	I feel as if I generally do understand everything that Is being said to me. At times though some things do get confusing and having anxiety I am sometimes scared to ask questions if I don't always understand what is being said. I feel I am very capable to make decisions without any help though. 
0.738900	I feel like for the most part I am able to make the appropriate decisions . If there is something that I do not understand I make sure to ask questions to fully understand it . If it is a bigger decision I take all the information I can from the doctor . I then go home and google and read as much as I can about the problem . I also talk to any and everyone who has went through the same thing . If I am still lost on what is going on I go back and talk with the doctor . If something doesn't click for me I keep asking till I fully understand it all . 
0.833333	I am a well educated professional who has the capability to understand and process health information as it pertains to my individual health or that of my family members. 
0.883333	I can comprehend and understand information for the most part, but I would ask questions for things just for clarification.
0.572200	Well it is all so complicated, not even just the medical information but the information needed to navigate the bureaucracy so that one can begin to have medical coverage and have things set up the right way to afford coverage. Then you have to do not only what is medical best for you based on what the doctors tell you but what works out with your work schedule and is covered by your insurance but often to find these out it is a waiting game. So you might pick one option in the hopes that you are covered but then find out later that you are not. Plus you might have to go out of work depending on what choice you pick and then you don't have a job and that makes future medical even harder. Plus I worry too about changing insurance standards because everyone seems to think that healthcare should be about making money instead of taking care of people. 
0.883333	have 100% degree to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions
0.833333	I am perfectly capable to understand, process and make health decisions for myself and help loved ones.
0.866700	I believe I have full capacity to fully obtain and understand health information. I am confident I could make the appropriate decisions about my healthcare based on the information that is readily available online or through the doctor.
0.633333	I am under the care of 2 to 3 doctors at any given time. At times I feel like I am being rushed and things aren't explained to me the way I need. I can fill out forms, but it seems they aren't read by the doctor. When given a diagnosis, I have to do the research to find out exactly what it means. I can say that my PCP does a better job than my other doctors in taking time to listen to me. I recently had a very bad experience with a surgeon and staff at a prominent hospital/medical facility all over forms. No one would really help me. They just passed me around to different people. I felt discarded.
0.555556	I have plenty of it Very cool ok yeah I like it a lot fun in the game of the house pink on the ear plain on the tail Oreo cookies
0.600000	Health information can be very confusing. They do not always write the information so that an average person can understand it. Many times, I have to ask what the long medical terms mean, then I feel stupid. It can get scary, causing even more questions that are hard to understand. Having the internet so handy now does help with searching, but then you find other information that is really scary. 
0.844400	I feel fairly confident that I am able to navigate most healthcare situations in order to get the information I need.  I have rarely had any sort of complications when going to a doctor's office, pharmacy, clinic, or hospital on the occasions I have had to go.

0.688889	I feel like I can fill out most medical forms, with a help of some questions so I can understand exactly what they are asking, and I do not answer the wrong question the wrong way.
0.722200	I can get alot more information on my own.  I just struggle sometimes really knowing what is relevant in my situation there is so much info on the internet, its hard to know.  Doctors always seem in a rush and I try my best to ask all the questions in a visit but sometimes forget or think of things later
0.916700	I have no problem asking a health professiol any questions to clarify anything I don't understand. Some Drs speak in medical terms and I often have to ask them to explain in layman's terms. My current Dr is extremely good about explaining everything and is more than willing to answer any and all questions.
0.872222	I can totally understand and process information. I have no problem understanding health information as I read up on things a lot.  What I don't know I look up information or ask.
0.805556	I am perfectly capable. In my opinion it is not hard at all. Also my moms a nurse so that helps me alot

There are only a few websites that are dedicated to explaining medical terminology and even these can be complicated to understand.

I am trying hard to understand everything and create a mental image. When I am processing the information I am thinking about the important things that are said.

0.900000	I feel confident that I will understand basic health information, and ask questions to obtain clarification or additional information.

The difficulty occurs when, if I have a health issue, and I wish to obtain further information, I don't always have the best understanding of what is then told to me. This is perhaps due to the fact that past a point, my knowledge regarding treatment and medications is lacking, and doctors do not often have the time to explain in detail exactly what certain things do. Even when they do, they do not specify side effects of treatments. As such, I am often worried about what will happen. 
0.916667	I believe I can understand all of my health info.  I can make my own decisions with the help of my doctor by him prescribing me with the meds that I need and have to take.  My doctor and I are able to make these decisions when he lets me know symptoms that I have .

I can think things through but have problems remembering so I try to go to appointments with notes that I type up in advance to make sure things don't fall through the cracks.   I can then make handwritten notes as the doctor or nurse answers the pre-typed questions.   The times I run into trouble is when I don't bring / take notes as I can easily forget some of what was said if I count on memory alone.  That is why I prefer to get written information that I can review slowly and refer back to as needed.

0.916667	I feel that I am more than capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.755600	"Yes, because there is this thing called Google.com. Google.com is a search engine that allows anybody to have the world's knowledge at the tip of their finger. You can search for ""How to walk your dog?"" to ""How to implement brain surgery?""."

0.838900	For the most part, I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the given information and external resources; however, the glut of resources available (between internet resources, studies, constant barrage of news, etc.) can make decisions more difficult. I feel this is further compounded by the general distrust of healthcare providers as of late due to news coverage, dealing with cost of services and insurance coverage, and the volume of patients versus the number of healthcare professionals to allow adequate time to get the information that one needs. These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics.

0.916700	I believe I have a well developed capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, and to take advantage of services, where applicable, to make appropriate health decisions.  The problem for me is not one of being able to understand materials, issues, and choices, it is about making the best choice with the available information, which is sometimes lacking, ambiguous, disjointed, incomplete, or even biased and perhaps incorrect.   I frequently consult with other health professiols when forming judgments about health decisions, and almost always benefit in the long term from doing so.
0.916700	I have the ability to read, research, ask questions and do anything else I need to understand the basic health information and services I need to satisfy my doctor and my insurance. I am not afraid to ask question. I feel I can obtain, process and understand everything I need or find a way to understand it.
0.761100	When it comes to processing and understanding all the health information that pertains to my own well-being, I believe I am confident in my ability to understand most of the jargon. However, since I'm no expert, there is some material which I will not always fully understand, and I am usually confident enough to ask doctors/nurses to give me some guidance.
0.850000	I feel fairly confident. I have access to the internet which helps quite a bit, and I'm not shy about asking questions or asking for clarifications if there's something I don't understand.
0.861111	I understand basic medical information so I don't need any help but my problem i after talking to the doctor and walking to the waiting room to leave I just forget about all that we talked about so I forget what the doctor tells me.
0.805600	I believe I am capable of understanding basic health information. I have the capacity sufficient to make the necessary health decisions on my own.

0.672200	I feel I can get most of the information I need if they're brought up. I worry that I may, or the staff may forget to check or mention something that will help my health. I also worry that some of the information is too complicated to understand and the meds prescribed have side effects that are glossed over.
0.883333	I understand info given or have the ability to ask the right questions about anything I don't understand.
0.900000	i understand everything i ask questions to the doctor about my health.  I understand the kind of medicine i take and i know when to take it ,   I go to the doctors and he explains everything to me 
0.750000	I feel I have the capacity to understand written and oral information from hospitals/nurses/doctors, but when they start using big word medical conditions I do ask for an explation.

0.850000	I feel competent when it comes to obtaining, processing, and understanding health information and I feel competent to make the appropriate decisions for me. I am quite well informed on a multitude of health information, and I spend time online doing my own research. General Practitioners are very useful, but I feel responsible for understanding my own health problems and researching them as much as I can. I have disagreed with a prognosis before and ended up being right. It pays to be vigilant.

0.722222	I think I can understand basic health information well . If I don't understand something I either ask the doctor or professional who is treating me or I will look it up on the internet.
0.900000	Whenever I've visited any health professional in regards to my health I've always had the option to seek out any health information that's necessary. Almost every single time they have always given out a few sheets of paper with a brief explanation of everything as well as always constantly asking me questions if I have any. They always have constantly made me feel as if I have the opportunity to understand and obtain the information with relative ease. 
0.733300	Sometimes I feel that I do not have a sufficient understanding of medical terminology to express to a doctor the concerns or problems I am having in a way that will help them to focus their treatment. I feel that often doctors are using a trial and error method of prescribing treatment and think that much of it could be because I am not communicating to them effectively.

0.744400	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information to a great extent. I am a nurse, so a lot of medical things I understand. But even being a health professional myself, I find some of the information is hard to understand, and I realize working as a nurse a lot of it is even harder for someone who has no medical background.

I try not to use things like webMD or other things on the computer and just listen to my doctor.  I don't want to get any false information or confuse myself.  I trust my primary health physician as he has been right in the past and has helped me get over a few things with no complications and fairly quickly in all instances as well.  He goes over any documents or directions with me before I leave so I can ask questions and so he knows I understand everything.  
0.577800	I feel like I can comprehend the information to a certain extent. I tend to go through it with someone I trust to make sure I understand the information and that I'm not missing anything. I feel like I have the capacity, but still rely on others to help me.

0.744400	Sometimes I get confused by the jargon and procedures. But in general, I can go to doctors appointment by myself and be fine. I can communicate and get the help I need. And doctors are usually good about explaining the important facts. If there is medicine or procedure I'm not familiar with, even after asking about it, I'll look it up online when I get home. 
0.572222	is very important. for a wonderful life, is a headshoot.now, can any person realize this in several time?

0.916700	I have no problem understanding what is said by my doctor or on written forms.

0.800000	yes I can if it is in plain english often there is to much medical jargon mixed in and it can be confusing such as diagnosis etc
0.666700	I think I have a good grasp, but sometimes the physicians differ in their abilities to convey information in a way that is useful to me as a patient. I find medical forms a challenge as I am dyslexic and also an immigrant. I usually have my husband read them over or fill them out for me.
0.666700	I don't have a problem dealing with medical stuffs because I had a sister who is a nurse by profession. I usually call her specially if I need some help with the information. It's pretty useful to have her in my back.
0.833333	I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND PRETTY WELL, AT LEAST WHAT PILLS IM TAKING, WHEN AND HOW MANY. WHEN I HAD CANCER I HAD TO HAVE THINGS EXPLAINED TO ME ABOUT TREATMENTS ETC.

I like knowing the results of my blood work and if something is wrong I ask questions.
0.916700	I have great doctor that has always been good about explaining everything in detail. Aside from that, I haven't had any major issues that were confusing or over-complicated.
0.822200	I can read all the information myself. Sometimes I need to ask the right professiol for help in understanding parts of it. I am capable of doing all of this for myself.
0.672200	I feel I have a very basic ability to understand basic health information, I find it easier to understand when layman's terms are used and not medical jargon, and if the writing is not very small, the fine print is too difficult to read.
0.605600	I believe with my schooling I have taken I could understand and process basic information. Once you get into more complex and unusually diagnosis is when I can no longer comprehend what is going on. I also have anxiety that does not allow me to fully process what the doctor is saying completely and I leave with only half of the information that was said. 
0.816667	I feel I am more confident in asking and answering health questions since a lot of my family and friends are in the health professions.
0.822200	I feel pretty confident that I can get the information I need. I usually search the internet thoroughly before a visit, so I go into the meeting with a pretty good set of questions, and hopefully a decent understanding of what the situation is. I always try to listen pretty carefully when speaking with my doctor in order to ask the appropriate follow up questions.
0.900000	Some information are difficult to fill. These questions can be like health insurances questions. n/a
0.644444	I think I have the basic skills necessary. What confuses me is whether or not certain information is relevant for me to put on the form because sometimes when I do that I haven't a question after or at the medical terminology gets more in depth and can confuse me.
0.733300	There are plenty of ways thourgh the internet to get information or direct contact from the nurse or doctor while its asked. 
0.866700	I feel I can handle basic health information between me and my caregiver or doctor.  What can be confusing is dealing with actual health insurance forms and questions.  Dealing with the health insurance companies can be a real pain sometimes as things are not always in clear cut, understandable terms.  Between me and my doctor, if I don't understand something, I always ask for clarifications.
0.883300	I really feel that most people have to rely on the information that their doctors present to them.  That is something that can lead to unfortunate circumstances when you consider that doctors are humans and some humans tend to take advantage of others.  
0.733300	I feel that many doctors and physicians use very technical terms, and do not want to spend the time to explain everything.  I trust a lot of what the doctor tells me with very little questions so that I do not waste their time.  I rely on using the internet to search out or answers any questions I may have
0.900000	I have the capacity to obtain & understand the information unless there are some medical jargons or procedures that need further explation from them.

0.544400	I have a basic understanding but many medical documents are confusing. This especially applies to insurance documents and co-pay amounts, deductibles etc. Many times I have been left with large Medical bills because I did not understand paperwork so it has lowered my confidence in my ability to fill out correctly on my own.
0.705556	I at least get to say enough that I need to at least to understand what is wrong with me even tho the doctors and nurses are always busy
0.766700	I believe that I am competent in basic services and health information but whenever doctors and nurses start using terms that I am not familiar with i have a problem. They say the terms and explain it in a way that they assume you are already familiar with the term 
0.827778	I feel I have a pretty good understanding. There have been occasions where I needed assistance to understand.
0.916667	I think I am perfectly capable of understanding how to make health decisions. I have no trouble reading or writing and I'm more than comfortable asking questions. 
0.888889	I read everything, research and ask questions until I understand and will fill out papers accordingly even if it takes me a while to figure things out
0.916700	I am a former medical school faculty in biochemistry. I helped teach and train doctors. I can listen to, converse, and understand medical jargon. As a former biomedical researcher, I often know more about the molecular mechanism of disease than many of the doctors I associate with, and I have no trouble asking questions and hearing recommendations.
0.672222	I feel like when doctors and nurses or medical field workers talk to me or other patients they pretty much know we don't understand medical terminology so most of the time we understand them. 
0.916700	I'm already a nurse practicer and usually, I don't need the help of anyone to understand basic health information and services
0.861100	I've never felt like it's been a problem. I haven't had a lot of issues filling out paperwork for various things, but I haven't needed to all that often (knock on wood). When I did, it was pretty straightforward. I'd leave things blank if I had to.
0.838900	I believe overall I can understand what medical professionals tell me about my health. Sometimes though I need to get them to repeat information I didnât fully understand the first time they explained it, especially when a lot of medical terminology is used.
0.844444	I don't believe I have a lot of difficulties processing basic health information from a medical professional. I believe I ask the right questions, if I remember to ask them. I expect medical professionals to ask me questions and to spend their time talking to me and assessing my medical needs. All these things being equal, I believe I am able to obtain, process, and understand what I need to in order to accomplish the goal of moving towards better health.
0.916667	I am one hundred percent certain that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and the services that I need in order to make appropriate health decisions. I am of sound mind.  
0.855600	Even if I have trouble understanding something (I can usually figure it out on my own), my sister is a medical biller, and I can always do a Google/Web MD search to answer any other questions.
0.600000	sometimes I have some particular difficulties to understand what it is written on the doctor's diagnosis. In some situations, i have some difficulties to better understand medical terms used by my doctors so I often  ask them to explain them to me
0.666700	My capacity to obtain basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is very high. The doctors and nurses try to give me as much information about my condition as possible and answers many questions I ask them. My capacity to process basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is kind of slow. I have to visually see what the doctors and nurses are saying to comprehend it. Just listening is not enough to register my condition. My capacity to understand is that I usually donât understand what is happening unless I am given time to process the information because I need time for the information to sink in and ask questions.
0.850000	I have a few chronic health issues, and I've felt with loved ones serious medical conditions. I've spent more than my fair share of time in doctor's offices, hospitals and clinics, you pick things up.
0.850000	I believe I have a huge capacity to understand basic health related information. I have worked in the health care field since I was 15 years old and have had many hours of training in medical terminology. I enjoy health related topics and understanding human anatomy. Itâs a passion to heal people.
0.883300	I think I am fully able to do and take care of myself and my own needs
0.866700	I feel pretty confident in myself. I am pretty young for an adult still, but I believe I am pretty competent and confident enough to understand what needs to be done pertaining to my doctor and my health.
0.616700	If I am interested in a not very serious illness then I look for information in the internet, but I always seek advice from the doctor is the condition is somewhat more serious.
0.872222	I understand what is said and can fill out the forms and read any booklets given to me.  I do have to sometimes come home though and look up my diagnosis on the internet.
0.855556	I am intelligent enough to ask for what I want - it is the doctor I do not trust to keep communication open, answer my questions thoroughly or allow my input in treatment options.
0.666667	I do pretty well understand since I sick at a very young age. My doctor ask my was it ok to have understand why it was important to not miss my meds. Because they help me to say out the hospital or from having a bad Ashman .
0.472200	I have a difficult time asking the doctor to clarify when I donât understand.  Sometimes I am intimidates or feel rushed.  It is hard to reach the office one I leave.  This has led to me discontinuing care and leaving the practice.  I can research basic information online, but when dealing with a complicated matter itâs not as easy. 
0.800000	I feel like I have enough knowledge about basic health situations to understand what my doctor is telling me. If I look confused when my doctor tells me something they will often explain what I need to know. I do not feel like I would understand things that are more uncommon like serious diseases or complicated insurance limitations.
0.916667	I think I have the understanding to complete forms and ask question if I don't understand. I have completed three years of college, and I am capable of read with comprehension.  I give the nurse or medical personnel all information on how I am feeling the symptoms I am experienced and the length of time I endured any symptoms
0.888900	I feel I have a capacity greater than most others in my age group to understand health information. I come from a family of health professiols and have a good vocabulary when it comes to healthcare terms. I also worked as a CSR for a major heath insurance company for a couple years.
0.883300	I don't have difficulty with anything.  Doctors and nurses are very good at explaining things in a way that I can understand.  They also provide ample opportunity for me to ask questions.
0.538900	I think I have a moderate capacity to do this. I think that they use a lot of difficult terms, and that is where the misunderstanding come from.
0.727778	If I don't understand what the doctors are saying I ask them to explain more in-depth. The only way your going to understand is by asking questions. They're doctors they probably have seen it all.
0.916667	I am confident that my perception and comprehension of basic health matters is beyond adequate to understand what I'm told by any health care provider. I regularly keep up with my health and I believe in questioning anyone that's involved with my health care.
0.794400	I can understand most basic health information, I might have an issue once in a while not understanding some concept. I try to ask questions to doctors and nurses but most of the time I think of additiol questions when it is too late because I already left the doctor's office. 
0.811111	I have the ability to understand basic health concerns, but just as any human being I feel uncomfortable and nervous when displayed with major or serious concerns. I often clam up and don't hear what is being said to me
0.888900	I am fully confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information about any condition I have in order to make appropriate health decisions.

0.683300	I believe I have average ability to get, and understand health information given to me. I sometimes need a little time to process what I should do to make the appropriate decisions. Overall though i am confident in my ability
0.872222	I think I understand most of it when it comes to the basic forms and information sheets. Any questions I may have if I don't understand, I have the confidence to address it. 
0.816700	I have the ability to understand all the information given to me by doctors and nurses.  Sometimes doctors do move quickly and so obtaining all the information can be tricky, I sometimes have to keep a running list in my head of things to circle back to and sometimes I forget before I have time to circle back to them.
0.866667	i have a great ability to understand it all.  just worry that if i get bad news, i will shut down.  in that case, i would have my son or his wife help me.  hasn't happened yet, though
0.733300	I am a pretty intelligent individual, so I think I have a higher comprehension than most. With that being said, I know when I go over my insurance plan and that sort of paperwork, I have a hard time understanding what all of it means. I never took any sort of secondary schooling in the medical field, so some of the terminology is beyond me.
0.761100	i have a high capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. i have been visiting medical professiols for decades and have always asked questions whenever the initial explations needed more clarifications. i have no issues in doing so until i can understand what is going on.

0.638889	I feel that I have the knowledge and experience to obtain the medical jargon and maintain for further reference.  I have a basic understating to the medical information presented to me.
0.561111	I don't always feel confident.  Drs don't tend to explain things in layman's terms and I don't know what questions to ask.  Its difficult if you're not sure if the questions you're asking are the right ones and if the dr is telling you all you need to know.
0.850000	I believe that I understand documents that are given to me concerning my health. If I do have a question, I feel comfortable enough to ask my healthcare provider to explain it to me.

0.916700	I consider myself to be intelligent, inquisitive and self-aware.  I always did well in science and was in advanced placement classes in biology in high school.  I research any and all health conditions that I've had, as well as those health issues my family and friends have experienced. Once, a medical professional commented to me that he thought I worked in the health field.
0.766667	I think I can understand basic health information if it is presented in an understandable manner.  I think a lot of this depends on the presentation itself.
0.744400	I feel like I do, but I get nervous when I talk to a doctor or nurse. When that happens, especially if they tell me that something is wrong, I get flustered and forget to ask what it is and all the questions. Then when i call I cant get them or they wont answer questions becuase they are too busy.
0.916667	I am very capable of handling my own medical affairs. The medical professionals I see do an excellent job of explaining medical issues and procedures and answering any questions I have about my health. I am also very good at finding and understanding information on my own regarding my medical health and conditions. 
0.522200	I believe that I am able to moderately understand the things presented to me
0.872222	I feel as though I have to be competent in this area in order to be my own health advocate.  Experience has taught me that not every health professional cares, so it's important to read, research, and ask questions
0.633300	I understand somethings that are presented to me but my problem is when they use big words. It's hard to understand some big words in the context they have it in
0.883333	I feel completely confident to do what I need to do at the doctors office and beyond. I don't need assistance and I always ask

0.900000	I completed and passed the courses and tests required in my state to become a licensed vocational nurse.  Since I have completed this course, I have a much better understanding of the medical terminology used by doctors and nurses.  I am also more aware of what questions need to be asked so that any questions that you may have will be answered in a way that you can understand.  Typically, my family prefers me to be there with them during medical visits because of my better understanding of medical terminology.  
0.900000	i fully understand the questions. i do not have any problems talking to my doctor about any issues. i am my own best advocate
0.805600	I feel I can effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.850000	"I feel that I can do all of the above on my own very well. Usually, I would just ask for ""help"" or advice from someone if I have been diagnosed with something they have previously had if I had any questions about it. I was also responsible for my grandma's health decisions and went to all of her appointments with her."
0.844444	I think I have an analytical mind that frequently leads me to research health information. As a biology major, I have a relatively good understanding of health concepts and mechanisms.
0.866700	I make sure to ask questins of anything that is not clear, and I don't stop until I am satisfied with the clarification.  I also will obtain more information on my own to confirm that what I've been told is true.  If there is any discrepancy, and if it is important enough to me, I have not reservations about seeking second opinion.
0.827800	I feel I'm intelligent enough to understand most information provided to me by my doctor. If I have a hard time understanding information, I'll rephrase my question or simply tell him I don't understand what he means. I sometimes think of additional questions after my appointment. If so, I'll usually look on the internet for answers. If I'm not confident in the information I find online, I'll call my doctor's office and ask to speak with him over the phone.
0.588889	its easy for me to understand and i know it help.i think its important to know all you info and for you to keep it all on you
0.827800	To make the appropriate health decisions  and understand basic health information  I feel like I'm pretty confident I could handle it by myself.  Sometimes if I do need help I will just find somebody and have them explain it to me.   I would say 75% of the time I could figure it out.  However I never sign anything that I do not fully understand. Because me and my wife work separate shifts  I have no choice to go to the doctors myself and fill everything else as well as take my 2 children to the doctors and fill their information out.   Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%. Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%
0.883333	The only thing I struggle with is understanding information from and about insurance companies. As far as actual health information, I feel I know and understand at least as much as the average person, probably more.
0.800000	I feel like I am able to understand what doctors and nurses tell me, especially my normal doctor. The only time I have had difficulty is when English is not the doctors first language.

0.550000	Some things don't understand they are confusing to understand what they are saying to you about what's going on with your body
0.855600	If I ever need help understanding anything at the pharmacy, they always are willing to take the time to explain any side effects or questions I have about specific medications.  When I see my doctor, it can sometimes be a little more rushed because he has so many patients during the day he has to see and he runs a very tight schedule.  However, I never felt like he answered any of my questions inadequately.  I usually do research on my own (online), before I go in for an appointment, so that I am better prepared to ask relevant questions regarding my potential diagnosis or ailments.  Therefore I know what to ask and usually have a good understanding of the health information presented to me.
0.900000	I have the capacity to understand basic info but it gets a little confusing once it starts getting into the more detailed stuff that you cant even understand what the words mean
0.550000	"I feel like it is very stressful and takes a long time to get someone to explain certain simple medical things/information to me, just for instance at my endocrinologists office (I am pre-diabetic), the nurse doesn't even know basic diabetic information such as what level your A1C should be to not be pre-diabetic or diabetic, she states she only draws the blood - but my doctors assistant is the same way, they do not know basic info for that field when I believe they should to save time for the doctor and also be able to explain it to you. My doctors sometimes do not use ""layman"" terms - they use long huge medical terms and don't really dissect it for you to understand, which leaves you to google which can be a severe panic attack in the making to do your own research."
0.850000	I have a PhD in public health, so I am generally pretty knowledgeable about health related issues. When I am uncertain about particular health conditions or my family history of disease I usually ask my mother, a nurse, for help.
0.900000	"Yes, I have the capacity to understand basic health information. I'm not sure what else to add?	I see a nurse practitioner, we have a good relationship and are able to communicate effectively. I'm very open with her and trust her advice. She spends an appropriate amount of time with me and answers any questions I may have."""
0.900000	I read voraciously. I am in the insurance field and feel up to date on coverages. I was a an er tech in the service with a pharmacy background. My daughter is the CFO at our hospital.
0.833300	I worked in a medical related field. Usually, i understand the terminology used by doctors or nurse. If i don't understand then i don't hesitate to ask them. Its my body i have to take care of it. If i still don't understand then i ask my closed friends or relatives. Most of them are in the medical field. For whatever reason i still need more explanation then i search on web and read about it, understand it and then make educated decison. Sometimes it does happend that i can't read doctors handwriting then i call their office and clarify it with their nursing staff, usually they are very helpful. 
0.916700	I do feel that I am able to understand the materials provided to me by doctors as well as ask any questions for items that I may not understand for my basic health and wellness.
0.738900	If I need help I can call the office and ask.  But sometimes I don't ask.

0.772222	I feel that I am fully capable of accessing and understanding my basic health information with little to no outside assistance. I have been to the doctors a few times and know what to expect and how to read and understand diagnosis and steps to take to, etc
0.672200	I feel like once I listen to what my doctor or nurse tells me, I need a few minutes to process it and by that point, they have left and I have been pushed out of the room and I now have a million questions I wanted to ask. On my last doctor's visit I left feeling confused and I realized in the parking lot I had no idea what I was supposed to do after my blood work results were going to be messaged to me. I then contacted my doctor, she was uble to respond to me, so I talked to a nurse who read the results and scared me to death thinking I had a disease and then hours later my doctor messaged me saying it's no big deal. 
0.855600	At age 67, my experience comes in handy.  I feel fully capable to make health decisions.

0.855600	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I understand these the most when presented in Layman's terms.

Also, years of experience taking care of my daughter's issues with mental illness and learning some much needed understanding of both circumstances. Making sure we both get plenty of exercise and to try to eat as healthy a diet as we can so we can both obtain a relatively productive lifestyle. Learning on what medications that can keep us  in good condition and the side effects that might occur. Keeping in close contact with our doctors and nurses.
0.750000	For the most part I think I have the full capacity. If its something that is really in depth I probably miss things and need someone to kinda help walk me thru it.

So I make sure to listen carefully,  ask plenty of questions if I do not understand,  and do everything my physicians instruct me to do. 
0.722200	I am not dumb. However, sometimes medical terms are used that are hard to understand. And I don't know how to apply them to what I or a family member has. So it's hard to translate those to a question I can make the doctor.

I always take a list of questions to ask my doctor (if I need to), and I do not leave his office until I am sure I understand everything I need to know about my condition, medications, and altertive forms of therapy.  I have to be my own health care advocate, because no one else will do it for me.
0.777778	It is rare that I need medical help, but on the rare occasion that I do I try to make sure I understand what the problem is, how to treat it, and what to expect from the treatment.

I've never not known what was going on with my health after a visit. 
0.766700	I think that i cam reasonably understand what is being told to me by health care professionals.  My dr is very good about taking time to clearly explain things and make sure that i am understanding what is happening before moving on.  Occasionally if i have questions i need to call back in to talk to a nurse to clarify something but that doesnt happen too often.  I also have a biology degree so i can understand a bit more behind the concepts that he refers to than the average person might.
0.544400	I feel very comfortable that I am able to understand basic health services.  Although sometimes services may be unclear, and the doctors diagnoses may bring about some confusion, I am generally able to understand and comprehend my illness and how to work other health services.  A lot of the times instructions are not entirely clear which also causes confusion.  This is probably my biggest issue.  Also, the handwriting of physicians is awful and makes it really hard to understand what they are trying to tell you.  Overall, I am confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions.

0.883333	i am completely sure that I would understand basic and perhaps intermediate level medical information
0.616700	I think it is a low capacity- mainly because I am usually very intimidated and do not realize all the questions and confusion I have until after the doctor leaves. I don't feel confident enough to question them, or to disagree if I think they might be making incorrect assumptions.

I see connections and understand the logic of cause and reaction.

I also have the internet of course including some resources there that my doctor has recommended. Overall I have had very few problems and when I do my questions are usually answered satisfactorily. 
0.772200	I feel basic medical information is easy to process, unless it is something that you are not aware of.

0.677800	I feel that I sometimes understand basic health information. There are times when I am reading my online medical chart after I get a result in that I will need to call the doctor to understand what it is saying. Most of the time I will make an appointment after getting a result back, just so I have that one on one conversation with my doctor. It feel I understand better when they explain to me face to face. That is when I feel I process the information very well. Especially when they show me different examples of what is going on in my body. It helps when the doctor doesn't seemed rushed. I think when the doctor is rushed not a lot of information is obtained.

0.777800	Sometimes my doctor will just scratch the surface when he explains things to me. He will avoid going into detail on what can happen if a test comes back a certain way.
0.855600	I feel I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Generally medical professionals are helpful in that regard, as if you ever have any questions, most are willing to explain it in detail. Also the age we live in, any questions about medical stuff are only a google search away. From the google search you can find actual medical documents explaining certain things, or just find other people like yourself suffering from the same thing who will share their experiences. Also not trying to brag but I've also been a smart person, so I find understanding things like this, isn't that tough. Generally though, I just try to make sure my Doctor and/or Nurses are fully informed of what is going on with me, and make sure to ask any questions I have.
