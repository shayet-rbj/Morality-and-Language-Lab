0.840000	I feel completely confident in my health care professional. He is very trustworthy and I have never had any issues talking to him about any of my medical problems. 
0.680000	I really like my doctor but I do find her rude at times and it is apparent when she is having a stressful day. Unfortutely a few months ago my summary of my doctors visit was given to another patient. The visit was incredibly persol and I was horrified. I have lost a fair amount of trust at the office since.
0.800000	I have a big trust in my doctor because he has chosen his profession because he wants to help people achieve good health and good life.  I feel that my doctor has no reason to give me something that would jeopardize my health and my life.
0.840000	My physician is always honest without being judgmental.  She tells me steps I can take, but understands when these steps are difficult to fit into my life.  She also is happy if changes are made as small steps or trying to complete one healthy change at a time, rather than expect me to completely alter my lifestyle.
0.520000	sometimes he go out of his way to help me get the medications or treatments that i need, so i trust him
0.960000	I really do trust my physician because of his bedside manner, his eye contact, his willingness to answer questions, the way he makes the encounter feel professional but personal. He always greets me when he enters the room, asks me how I've been, reviews the previous visits with me, asks if there have been any new updates or changes, if I've been sick lately. The tone he sets for the entire encounter is always very positive. He makes me feel like it's not just about a paycheck or a routine of his daily life. He asks me if I have any questions. If I do have questions, he's always willing and able to answer me honestly and completely. Sometimes he offers up information on natural remedies that usually have no drawbacks. His attitude is always bright and positive and I never have to dread going in for a checkup or appointment for a new issue. I also know he won't speak of it outside of the appointment. He has my confidence.
0.920000	I have had he same primary physician for 9 years and I trust him with my life because we have formed a bond and I know he cares about me and my well being
0.760000	i do not really have much to say about it after all medical treatment is not an option its a nicesity
0.960000	I trust my Dr because he is very experienced and he knows what he is talking about. I am confident that he has my best interest at heart.
0.560000	I don't trust my primary care doctor mostly because I feel like I'm being rushed through my appointments. Also because they tend to diagnose you with something and give you medication even when they are not completely sure if what is really wrong with you.
0.560000	I trust them to an extent. However, they are human, they make mistakes and they can't always devote full attention to every patient.
0.600000	Doctors tend to just want to prescribe drugs whether or not you actually need them. It's how they're taught to do their job. 
0.840000	i trust my doctor he is insiteful and forthcoming, he brings up tips and information that is  having a healthy life
0.880000	I have known my doctor since my first daughter was born over 13 years ago.  She has treated all of my children.  I started seeing her myself 4 years ago and she has always given me insightful options and thorough testing.
0.880000	I have done a lot of research on my current doctors and have taken the necessary steps to be sure that I am being seen by competent and caring individuals. I trust their opinion and knowledge with regards to my healthcare. When I am seen by them I feel welcome and encouraged to speak about my concerns rather than rushed and ignored. 
0.520000	i believe that doctors  are in the of making money, because if they cure people no one will come to see them
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I've had the same doctor since I've been born. I have the same doctor that helped my mom give birth to me 
0.680000	For the first few years I had full confidence in my primary care doctor. In the past year or two she has taken on many more new patients, and as a result she is harder to contact and schedule appointments with. She spends less time with me during my appointments and the conversation can sometimes be rushed. I feel like due to time constraints, she often forgets to tell me something, such as a treatment option or type of medication that could be helpful to me. Because of this, I have lost some confidence in her ability as a health care provider.
0.720000	I have been to many primary care doctors in the past. Because of this, I have gotten to know who is a good doctor and who is not. My current primary care physician is very helpful and caring. She never rushes me and spends as much time as I need answering my questions. She is also familiar with my condition, so I trust her in giving me the correct dosing for my medication. She is also empathic and can explain things in a way that makes sense. 
0.680000	I like my doctor. She is very thorough in some areas but a little cavalier in others. I've had to come back twice because she said something wasn't important and it turned out to be more serious.
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because they're usually there if I need them. They also ask other questions even if it's not regarding to what I came in for.
0.800000	I feel that with all his training and years of practice he does know what is best for me and tries to help with any problems I may have.  Once in a while we don't agree but can work something out that we can both agree upon.
0.920000	He has been my primary care physician for my entire life. He has never let me down in the past so I have no reason to expect him to in the future. He is a reliable person overall.
0.800000	Overall, I'd like to think that most doctors have their patients' best interests at heart. Through all of the knowledge they've acquired, their able to help change people's lives.
0.360000	I used to trust my doctor until last summer.  I took my son to see the Dr. and he said he just has an infection take these pills and get some rest.  I trusted my gut and took my son to the ER and found out that he was a type 1 diabetic and he almost died because the doctor did not diagnose him properly, he spent a week in the hospital recovering.
0.600000	because it is in his own best interest to what would best for me. This what he has trained for and has taken an oath to do what is best for his clients. so I believe he would do what is best for men.
0.400000	I don't have a primary physician, but I feel that overall, doctors are more concerned about the bottom line than the patients. In the past, I have been prescribed medicine I don't need for a condition I don't have, just because the physician I was seeing was paid to do so by the pharmaceutical companies. I don't feel that doctors really listen to their patients. 
0.800000	I've known him since I was a kid. He's been my family and personal doctor for over 30 years and I trust him. He's helped me through quite a few issues and struggles.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because I feel she has my best interest at heart. She listens to my complaints and ask questions concerning them. If she can't figure something out, she will refer me to another physician.
0.640000	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mine, but sometimes I do not agree with their treatment ideas. I had a doctor make me get an endoscopy for abdominal pain. It was quite an invasive test that was useless as it did not show the cause of my abdominal pain. I went to another doctor who ordered a non invasive abdominal ultrasound which showed gallstones. I had to suffer and take it upon myself to get the care I needed.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because she gives all the information I need She gives me options on how to care of myself and my health
0.520000	Do not always feel he is listening, but he does often get back to me after investigating certain things.
0.400000	I have had way too many bad doctors in the past. I literally had a doctor look at my mom when I was 5 and tell her it wasn't if I got cancer due to my family history, it was when (while I was sitting there). After that, I started having anxiety about going to doctors and my health. I was severely overweight and another doctor told me to run and eat less. I wasn't physically capable of running. My knees were damaged. I have never been able to trust a doctor to look out for my health. 
0.600000	I trust my doctor for the most part. There are a few occasions when I do more research because I feel like the doctor is not telling me everything or that he doesn't have my best interest. When it comes down to it, I trust him more than often.
0.760000	Seems nice and listens to me she reminds me of me physically so I can relate to her.  She is a female so it's nice that we can discuss colon topics 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because we have a great understanding. We are able to openly communicate and I can also ask any questions that I have. I am comfortable with my doctors. I usually only have doctors I use if I feel comfortable with them.
0.880000	He is someone who is honest. When I have a question, I dont hesitate to ask and he is clear with his answers. 
0.640000	I mostly trust my doctor. However, I've only been seeing this particular doctor for 5 months. I think doctors, for the most part, intend and try to do the best for their patients. I also think that sometimes, other things, like scheduling, unforeseen emergencies and whatever get in the way. When these things happen, doctors just do what they can and maybe don't spend as much time with their patients as they should. 
0.600000	My visits often feels hurried and like there's not enough time for a thorough consideration of my health issues. She seems completely competent, but I don't think enough time is given for her to really be very thorough.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He's never led me wrong so far.
0.800000	He seems to know what he is talking about so I trust him.
0.600000	Some doctors do care about their patient's welfare, however other doctors just see dollar signs on the patient's forehead and are just working for money to go on vacations. 
0.840000	Other members of my family see the same primary care physician as me, and she noticed a serious medical issue affecting my mother before any other doctor.
0.560000	No matter where I go it seems doctors and facilities are more concerned about expediency and cost than care.
0.960000	I have had the same primary care doctor for quite a number of years and she has always taken the time with me to figure out any problems and treatments available. She helps me come to a decision with treatment plans, taking my day to day life into account. If she doesn't know an answer, she will tell me, and refer me to a specialist she trusts to help me.
0.680000	Regarding doctors in general, I have trust in them because I have no other choice. I have to trust that my doctor has my interest in mind. However, I am also aware that many doctors are often sponsored my drug companies, or they could just be wrong about certain medical opinions. Therefore, it is necessary to get a second opinion. 
0.240000	because she tells me nothing. she invites other doctors in that also say things like it doesn't look good but when you ask them what it is they say i can't tell you here is a referral to another doctor who then says the same things and prescribes drugs without an explanation at all of what it is and what its for
0.680000	i trust my doctor to a point but them it is up to me to make sure them i get a second opinion then take it from there
0.720000	Cool ok yeah I like it a lot it cool fun interest nice storm rainy day cloudy in the sky winter day on the snow of the ocean barn b in the frogs one get rich and horse in the deerr
1.000000	I have built up a great relationship with my doctor.  He allows me to contact him anytime and that makes a very persol relationship. 
0.760000	My doctor is very blunt and tells it how it is. He tells me all the options and then tells me what he recommends.
0.640000	I trust doctors because that's the only gap between dying from a cold and living with cancer. I believe doctors are really important and valuable to the world for the sense of security and safety. They are the closest things to magicians due to the miracle they are able to perform.
0.720000	I need to know all the side effects of each treatment and take a proactive stance when it comes to my medical treatment.
1.000000	My doctor truly have my best interest at heart. She takes her time to explain everything. She goes over & beyond.
0.840000	My primary care doctor goes over all of my options and I have asked about options that she has not presented and she will explain why she thinks that option would not fit my lifestyle.  She also genuinely listens to my concerns and answers my questions.  
0.880000	My old doctor is retiring and the last few times I have had the doctor that will replace her when she retires. He is young but seems competent. I haven't really seen him so often as to really build any kind of relationship with him yet. 
0.600000	I don't have a primary care physician at this time.  In general, I do trust my doctors though.  I think most doctors are honest and capable.
0.320000	The last time I want to my doctor he seemed rushed and had other things to do do. He said he was going to do a tetnas shot that day. He never marked it in his notes so the nurse never gave it. 
0.720000	they're medically trained and have good bedside manners. Shows genuine concern for my health and wealth being.
0.840000	I have always had trust in my primary physician.  He has a great bed-side manner and is very personable and explains things very well.  My father was a physician and I am able to relate to him because of this.  I also know that he his telling me the truth that I need to hear as this is the same things that I heard from my father.  I respect his years of service in the industry as well as he has practiced his trade for over 20 years.  I also trust the people that recommended this physician to me.
0.840000	My trust my physician because I just do. They know what they're doing and I've been going to the physician ever since I was a child so there's no distrust with my physican
0.960000	My doctor has never let me down or been wrong.  I have been seeing her for a very long time and she will do whatever it takes to make me feel better or to get to a perfect conclusion as to what is wrong with me.  She believes in referrals and never hesitates to get me to the appropriate specialist if needed.
0.640000	I like my doctor and he has always been conservative in his treatments.  He lets me know when something will have a side affect and also lets me know when he is doubtful that something will work but is willing to try.  I feel that he is in general very honest with me.
0.520000	I feel like if I tell you there is something wrong then you should believe me. My doctor is pretty good at checking out whatever my issues are. He will have me to try to things at home to help before taking more invasive measures.
1.000000	I started going to a new doctor since we moved. He is very gentle & kind. I had to have tests done, it didn't take long for him to call me with the results. 
0.760000	I assume they have the relevant information, training, and experience to make the recommendations they do, and follow from there.
0.920000	Because not only do they care for me, they ask when the pain last occurred and to rate it on a scale. They have more than one way to solving from the most risky to the less.
0.680000	I definitely depend on my primary care doctor but I do know enough when to seek out a specialist.  I'm very fond of my doctor but I always question medical decisions.
0.680000	I like this doctor because be listens To my concerns. But he doesn't over prescribe medicine for my condition
0.720000	I do feel that if I go to my doctor they will give me the best medical attention as possible but I am also aware of natural way of healing that can also be applied.  The natural way are never mentioned by my doctor.  Because of side effects of medications I will often try a natural way of healing first followed by a medication only if absolutely nessesary. I often feel that side effects are overlooked and not discussed. 
0.520000	My Dr. really cares for her patients. She is wonderful. If you have an issue, she will give you a list of specialists and tell you, which one you should go. he is very professional.
0.600000	I feel doctors do not generally look at all options and want to do what is best for their schedule, not what is best for the patients needs
0.600000	Some doctors I feel rush through the appointment and I leave feeling uncared for which is not the purpose for my visit
0.960000	HE LISTENS TO WHAT I TELL HIM ABOUT MY HEALTH AND IF SOMETHING IS NEEDED, HE WILL EXPLAIN IT TO ME. I ALWAYS WILL GET WHAT EVER TESTING  I NEED DOWN WITHOUT A SQUABBLE.
0.920000	I believe he is smart and thorough. I don't usually need him for many things but he has always had good advice when I do have a problem.
1.000000	my primary doctor has all my my health in good hands and she works to keep me on the right track. she is truly successfully keeping her pentions in good health 
0.640000	I feel that they are in a hurry sometimes, and i get the feeling it is about the money, and  they are too quick to perscribe pills instead of trying other treatments first
0.560000	I trust the PA more then my primary doctor, she is more willing to find out what is wrong with me. Some primary doctors are only in it for the money and are not willing to diagnose and find out what is wrong with their patients. If a test doesn't show what is wrong then it ends there
0.560000	They prescribe a pill for whatever ails you and they don't have time to search for the real cause of disease. Too many prescription drugs prescribed for 1-sentence diagnoses 
0.840000	I have complete trust in my doctor because I have been his patient since I was 19 years old.This doctor has delivered all 3 of my kids and I know if I tell him something that conversation stays between him and myself. He's very professional and he cares about his patients.
0.800000	I trust my primary care because he hasn't ever done anything wrong. He gives me the utmost care and isn't ever in a rush. But to say I completely trust him would say I don't trust my own hunches. I know when something is wrong with my body so I can't put all trust in him. He's great at what he does but he can only do so much.
0.800000	I have seen the same physician for 25 years and he has a limited number of patients as he is in semi-retirement. He takes his time and asks questions and explains things in terms the average person can understand.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because first off, he always remembers me, even when I have not seen him in quite some time. He is very personable towards me and makes me feel comfortable. He allows me to express what I feel that I need before making his own professional recommendations.
0.640000	I think that my doctor is a good and genuinely knowledgeable person, but sometimes thinks he needs to dumb down explanations or ease my worries instead of giving me all the facts.
0.720000	I wonder if there might be something she's not telling me to keep me from becoming upset--not diagnosis-wise, but possible non-serious effects of medicine or activity
0.760000	I feel like doctors are just in and out of the room so fast and I don't feel like they actually care about your situation they just need to hurry and get to the next patient.
0.360000	They use my past drug usage to assume they know what I need instead of asking what they think I recommend and going from there with options
0.520000	I mostly distrust my primary care physician because she changes her mind often and rushes through appointments.
0.880000	I have had the same doctor all of my life and rely on them to make sure I feel good in all situations.  I believe that normally all people are in this world to do good, especially doctors as I know they are there to look out for people.
0.720000	Dr's goto medical school so they know their health. Sometimes people dont want to hear that they are sick so they might want to disagree with the Dr. to feel better in a sense of denial. I think medical school vs. no school its better to trust the dr.
0.760000	Because we've known each other for a long time now and all of the treatments I've done from him have had no issues up to this point.  I trust my doctor to make the best recommendations for me and keep me healthy.
0.560000	I don't trust or distrust them. They are very busy and medicine is complicated so I'm sure they will make many mistakes.
0.520000	I feel with their busy schedules, as much as they like to dwell on a patient, unless you're going to ask lots of questions.  They will give you a primary brief overview and description of your issue and then move on to the next.  Doctors are forced to see so many patients in a day and in between squeeze a break in.  With that limitation there is only so much persol care they can have.
0.680000	I don't fully trust one of my primary care doctors  because my bills are always really high. It's like she just orders every test she can possibly find even though it's not necessarily needed. If you tell her you don't do well with certain meds she'll say that she thinks they're better than the kind you do well with.
0.760000	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician. I believe that they are the most capable person to diagnose and treat my medical conditions and that they have my best interests in mind.
0.800000	They have shown me options that don't cost me money at all. Something that I can do on my own to help deal with issues I may have. His last resort would be additiol treatment or medication. 
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician so I am unable to fully complete this section.  I do trust doctors in general and rely on them if I should ever need to use a medical service.
0.920000	From my overall history with doctors, I trust my current doctor almost completely. She is young and I haven't had her for long (about 2 years), which is why she doen't have my complete trust yet. She does care about me and my health and is very thorough in her assessments. I am very pleased to have her.
0.600000	I believe doctors in general are well-trained, but even they make mistakes at times. I am not sure of the accuracy of that specific doctor.
0.680000	I feel like my doctor cares, but is also very busy. Sometimes it feels like a whirlwind once she's in the room with me. She always asks if I have any questions before she leaves, but sometimes I feel so caught up in the pace that I can't really think of anything at the time. It's nice that her office has an online portal that I can send in a message and get a response from a nurse after the fact. 
0.560000	I feel that my medical care providers are very well educated and i can tell, I think they have every motivation to to open and fair and honest with me because they have years of experience and they would not be in the position if they were not adequately helping patients
0.600000	I trust that my primary care physician is knowledgeable but sometimes wonder if she has ulterior motives when she is always trying to push medications on me which I do not think I need. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor because i make her career. If she is carless and overlooks something it could destroy her. Without me she wouldnt have a career. I would she spend so musch time and money on a career that she didnt care about.
0.320000	Poor bedside manner caused me to switch doctors, now I see a nurse practitioner who takes time to explain the condition and is much more pleasant to be around
0.840000	I usually trust my primary care physician as I am taking treatment with her for a long time and she is a good friend of me and she used to give a good treatment and guide me in good manner.
1.000000	i totally trust everyone of my doctors i know that they thinking more about me and my health problems
0.680000	I haven't seen a doctor in a long time, and my recent visit had me feeling a bit wary about everything. I was worried about the cost of everything, and listening to my doctor talk about going to see some specialist for one thing, and a specialist for another thing made me very alert and unwilling to agree to either one. I just don't believe I have complete trust in the American Healthcare System and its practices, in regards to cost for the patient. I.e. a saline bag being charged at $100, when they are manufactured at perhaps $0.25
0.800000	I trust them because they seem ethical.  You lknow that feeling that you get when yoj talk to someone that means that you can just trust them?  I fet that feeling from her when I talk to her.  She's really smart and into you quite a bit when you talk with her.  Id recommend her to anyone looking for a doctor in their near future for sure!
0.800000	I would rather select slightly agree but that's not an option. I've only been seeng this doctor for over a year. About 4 visits because the doctors sometimes rotate or finish their residency. I have to be my own advocate and never completely trust someone with your life in their hands without doing a little of your own research first.
0.800000	I trust my primary care provider because they take the time to talk things over with me. They also listen to me and any problems that I bring up. I can also rely on them to treat me and talk about treatments with me whenever I have a problem that needs to be taken care of. 
0.720000	nothing like that i can feel the importance and trust mmyself very easy so am saying that very confidiently that i can do all by myself
0.800000	There are instances or maybe rare instances that I did not trust my doctor one time because all he/she ever gave me was simple remedy that I could have just researched in the internet.
0.520000	"Medicine is now practiced by rote. The ""average"" person will accept the off-the-cuff surface diagnosis.  I'm not one of those people. As my mother pointed out years ago, presidents, kings, and doctors, all put their pants on one leg at a time. I only accept the ""Gospel truth"" from the Gospel."
0.640000	I think my doctor is very good but sometimes doesn't have complete understanding of my medical conditions.
0.680000	He does listen to me and give me suggestions to solve a problem (see another doctor, specialist) but never has the answer himself.
0.840000	THEY DO SEEM TO CARE FOR YOU BUT SOMETIMES IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU NEED A QUICK APPOINTMENT BUT THEY ARE TOO BUSY TO SEE YOU IMMEDIATELY BUT MUST WAIT FOR A LATTER APPOINTMENT 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because She is someone I have known for a long time and also knows my family.  This person has always had my best intentions and has always helped me to feel better when I was feeling ill.
0.720000	My physician does not rush me out of her office. She sits and talks with me and makes me feel like a person rather than just another face in her daily routine. She tells me about her past experiences as she is less than ten years older than me and has gone through a lot of the same things I have. She tells me what things she thinks are optional (flu shots, etc...) and what I really need to get done to stay healthy. 
0.760000	I trust her, though sometimes I think she rushes me through because I am very healthy.  However, on the whole, if I had a serious problem, I would absolutely trust her to give me the all the options and detail risks and concerns.
0.960000	I trust my Doctor because I know he has his patients (myself included) best interest at heart.  If I have questions he always will explain his answers in a way where I will understand.
1.000000	My doctor is excellent.  He never makes me feel rushed and he always takes the time to answer questions for me.  He is extremely thorough when I have to see him about something.  He also has a very human quality about him, unlike many doctors I have dealt with in the past.  He also sees my young daughter and is extremely thoughtful and thorough, more so when dealing with a youngster.
0.680000	my doctor is human and even though researches the products still want to make a quick buck and ginipig pig us patients
0.520000	I don't know my doctor well enough to give any specifics.  Since I'm pretty healthy we haven't needed to have a relationship other than wellness checkups and a few tests.
0.640000	"He is knowledgeable, yet I'm unsure if he understands my discomfort. I hope for more of him when I see him. Yet I hear a lot of ""that's normal for you"" when I want him to do something about my symptoms "
0.680000	Doctors in general I feel can be trusted. If anything, their reputation is on the line, and in any field, reputation is key.
0.800000	I've known for this doctor for years, and for the most part he has been quite helpful. Thereby, when he outlines a plan for me to follow, I generally follow it. There have mostly positive results. Thereby, increasing my trust in him. 
0.520000	I've had 2 doctors in my life give me bad information.  So, I'm a little weary. I had one the was obviously getting paid to prescribe a certain pill and he pushed it hard on me.  When I got my second opinion the Doctor told me I didn't need pills.  I do think Doctors know way more than me but I'm cautious now with them. 
0.600000	I don't trust doctors in general. I do not feel that doctors in these days and times actually have a passion for the job as they use to. It is now just a form of financial gain.
0.840000	My doctor was referred to me by another doctor who spoke extremely highly of him and had nothing but excellent things to say about him.
0.760000	HE IS VERY IN THE KNOW AND TAKES TIME TO LISTEN AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT I MIGHT HAVE. HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT ID CAUSING THE HEALTH PROBLEM.
0.920000	my doctor is open, honest, tell it like it is, what the expected results should be; the cost, the reason for the prescription, etc.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and able to explain to me what exactly is going on and I like her as a person.
0.640000	My seemingly distrust for most doctors comes from experiences of people that are close to me. I've seen doctors misdiagnose or treat for wrong illnesses way too often. I've also seen and heard about them prescribing medicine that was unnecessary.
0.720000	I didn't in the beginning. He's kind of hard to get to know but, after three years he seems to have relaxed and has confidence that I am making an attempt to do what he says and take care of myself.
0.800000	I have never had a problem with my doctor.  They explain my medications and recommend new ones if never.  To date they have been right on the button and I don't have mother negative about them.
0.720000	I think that the majority of doctors enter the field because they have some desire to help others. I trust my doctor, who has undergone years of schooling and is an expert, to guide me on the correct path to health. 
0.640000	My primary care physician has a large practice which makes it difficult to believe he's spent the appropriate amount of time reviewing my case. There have been times when the diagnosis he has given is completely wrong and the treatment provided only causes more harm.
0.800000	"I've always had a good experience with my primary care physician. I can understand why some people might have had a bad experience with their persol doctors, but that doesn't mean their experience is the only experience anyone has ever had with doctors - my experience with doctors has certainly been positive. I'm certainly not desperate enough to rely on those ""THINGS DOCTORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" ads, anyways."
0.440000	I trust doctors being they e had more schooling in medical than the average person but sometimes it's hard to trust them because they check you over and diagnose problems so quickly or sometimes they have to look up your symptoms or ask a colleague for advice to determine a diagnosis. 
0.640000	I feel like I trust physicians in general, however, if I was about to make a serious decision regarding my health, I would not hesitate to get a second opinion if I felt uncomfortable. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I have never been led astray before by him. Every time that I went to my primary care physician, it has been a pleasant experience. I have gotten good medication and health advise. 
1.000000	I have found my primary care physician to be a very good listener who asks pointed and relevant follow up questions. He also takes into account my experiences with various medicines and treatments when prescribing tests and/or new medications. 
0.760000	I tend to trust my PCP because my family and I have been with him for a long time. Negative experiences with new, specialized doctors have recently led me to doubt/question all doctors.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for many years and has always done the correct thing pertaining to any sickness I've had. He has never treated me wrong or diagnosed me with the wrong illness. 
0.800000	In addition to a primary care physician, I also have many specialists and sub-specialists.  I find my primary-care physician works well with these other doctors to ensure positive outcomes.
0.800000	I've little choice in the matter really. My trust would have to be in the institutions that educated the idividual(s).
0.840000	My doctor has been my PCP for years and I trust him. I don't get sick often, but when I do he hits the nail on the head with the diagnosis. He listens and I feel he truly cares about my well being
0.640000	There might be lots of factors why a primary care physician make certain decisions. There could be influence from the practice to meet a certain quota when invoicing. Drug companies often have 'agreements' with practices so their products are preferred in the treatment of certain conditions. Sometimes practitioners are under time constraints so may opt to try a treatment for something non-life threatening and recheck later to assess response
0.480000	All he want is the money the meds he give me all of 5hem has side affect some times it might work and sometime they do Not work it just about money. Its sad
0.640000	I don't have much to say. Doctors get the job done. Insurance should be free. Healthcare shouldn't be a privilege. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they are a professional and it is their job. In my experiences, they seem to know what they are doing, provide good advice, and respond to any questions and concerns I have. The person looks and acts professionally and I have no reason to distrust them or doubt their competence. They are more knowledgeable than me so I trust their advice and directions on health matters.
0.520000	I feel like most doctors just write prescriptions for whatever condition you may have and things like diet, exercise and more holistic options are not given to the patient. I would trust my doctor more if it seemed like they knew more about things other than drugs. 
0.880000	I trust them to stir me in the direction of wellness and find a cure to the issue. Do not have a primary physician.
0.840000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with my primary care physician for almost my entire life, so we have had plenty of time to develop a good rapport and a good relationship. I trust her with my concerns and with explaining things to me so I can understand them
0.520000	I have always felt rushed and just another number when going to the doctor. I have also been shamed by a few doctors for carrying some extra weight. Overweight people know they are heavy and need kind and conpassiote care, not being lectured to. 
0.720000	My Doctor has a degree and knows what he is doing , When he is doing surgery on me he is in control I am a sleep and give him all my trust. When he orders medication I trust him to do whats right
0.800000	My PCP always ask about my health physically and mentally and is always engaged in my questions and concerns and provides any info that can enhance my health and life in general.  She makes me feel like a person and not another 30 minute slot to fill
0.800000	My doctor is fairly conservative in treating most issues initially. On the other hand, he is proactive and quick to address problems needing immediate attention and action. He also believes in natural solutions over pharmaceuticals whenever possible.
0.480000	I feel my doctor is not concerned about me I have health insurance and he is getting paid. I get feel he does not want to touch me.  I am just another number he is rushing out to see the next person
0.720000	I have somewhat trustworthy of my doctor  I know my body more often than she does cause I don't she but once out  the year and my test 
0.600000	I think I can trust my doctor enough to know what is wrong with me but i would get a second opinion if I had something big wrong or thought the answer was not up to par.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he is a family friend. He would tell me the truth about whatever I see him for. I believe he would anyways because it is not worth it for him to lie to anyone. There is so much information out there that doctors can quickly be checked if they are not telling the truth or are incompetent. 
0.480000	I sometimes trust doctors about certain things, but overall I'm a bit suspicious of healthcare providers in general. I've got friends and family who work in the healthcare industry and they talk about all sorts of shady, crappy things that go on. In addition to the fraud I hear about in the news, and my own negative experiences with doctors, it's difficult for me to take everything they say at face value.
0.680000	I get a new doctor each time so it's hard to build trust. They don't necessarily know my medical history so it's hard to trust them.
0.640000	easy to use an great fun helpfor use to remain healthy and useful help and good reviews and helpful
0.760000	I like my doctor.  She took me on as a patient even though she was not accepting new patients.  She helped me through a very difficult time.  She listens to what I have to say and especially how I feel.
0.640000	i think i trust them because they know alot about me and they are they to keep me safe.Without we wouldnt know what is wrong with us and how to keep up with our body
0.680000	I think that for the most part that doctors do look out for you and want the best for you but I also thing that life gets in the way sometimes and maybe they just want to shuffle you out of the office so they can go home.
0.640000	I do not go to the doctor often so from my experience would require more time with the person but sometimes I believe doctors are dishonest in treatment plans as they don't give medications that will heal but rather fix the problem temporarily so that a patient returns
0.600000	I normally trust my doctor, however, I have gotten diabetes and tardive dyskinesia as a result of medications prescribed to me by some of my doctors. For that reason, I don't completely trust doctors.
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing her since I am a child and she always will go the distance to figure out what is wrong with me when it is something more than just a cold. She will order multiple test and blood labs, and always tries to explain all information with me. I am comfortable in talking with her openly and she does the best she can to keep me at ease.
0.760000	She has delivered all 5 of my babies and she didn't miss a single one she takes the time to listen to me and even called my insurance company to help me out
0.760000	My PCP is open and I believe honest. She also takes time to listen carefully to me, and I believe she respects my input. I feel we work together as a team, and her words and actions reinforce my belief.
0.800000	I don't have any complex medical conditions so anything the doctor tells me I have no real reason to doubt. I don't see any ill effects from whatever I have been told by my primary doctor.
0.600000	I trust my doctor, but I understand that she has pressures and influences that may not lead to the best care for me. I believe a patient must take an active part in their own care if possible.
0.560000	I believe my doctor does the best he can under the time constraints he has because he does see so many patients. He will suggest a treatment that has worked for most of his patients. If that fails to help, he is open to trying other treatment plans. My lack of complete trust is due to my doctor's limited time to spend with each patient. 
0.200000	I am in the process of changing Dr's. I recently have been mis-diagnosed and received wrong meds. Also not given blood tests that where needed in advance of cataract surgeru
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor, or any doctor wholly because I do feel as though they are all about the money in most cases. 
0.520000	I think my doctor can be in a hurry and not always listen to what I am saying. She likes to push me off to specialist when I don't always feel I need to see one.
1.000000	I have been with my current primary care physician for over 10 years.  She knows me as well as my family.  She explains things if I don't understand.  She listens when I have concerns.  I trust my physician to provide care that is best for me.
1.000000	i have been using the same doctor for 18 years she delivered my son. also was a mentor to my daughter. she also treats her medically
0.640000	I think most doctors have the best intentions and do truly want to help but I feel like they are put in the position where they are not allowed to give their patients the time they need to in order to do their job thoroughly.
0.840000	Over the years, my doctor has proven that he knows my issues, listens to me carefully and always makes the right choices for me about my care and well being. I completely trust him because he has fixed many conditions and proactively treated me to prevent complications and other issues.
0.600000	I THINK HE IS A GOOD DR. HE TRIES VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO ME AND HELP ME OUT. WE ALSO TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO HIM. HE IS VERY THOUROGH
0.880000	She is always helpful and straightforward with me. She seeks to empathize with issues I've been having and understand better what's going on with me. For example, she asked me about my vegetarianism when I told her that was something I was doing.
0.760000	I don't know. I just trust my doctor. I guess she hasn't given me a reason not to trust her.
0.640000	what if a doctor is trying to get you on a medication you dont need  i know most doctors help  people some are in it for the money
0.800000	I do not know my doctor very well but the contact. Inhave had with her is all positive. She has answered all my questions and has been correct in her diagnosis of my conditions.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he usually thoroughly explains everything to me, and is able to answer any questions that I may have. He also explains pros and cons for treatments and helps me to choose what is best for me.
0.560000	I have a new doctor. So I have to see how I can work well with them. I need to communicate with her carefully to get the information and help that I am in need of.
0.760000	I don't feel I have a reason to doubt the sincerity of my primary care physician, as I feel that when I've gone to see him, he performs a thorough exam and blood work, etc., and has not recommended any courses of treatment that seemed suspect to me. Fortunately I have been very healthy and so have not really had many visits with him other than my yearly checkups, so I suppose I don't know if I can fully trust his decisions on treatment options, but I really don't have a reason to doubt him.
0.840000	My primary care physician actually listens to me, takes the time to hear and understand my concerns, and is willing to explore alterte treatment options er provide referrals to other specialists if we agree there may be some benefit.
0.880000	I have been seeing the same doctor since I was a young adult, he's always been kind, and comes of caring and astute. My doctor has never given me a reason to question his decisions. 
0.880000	Same doctor for 7 years so good rapport. Doctor keeps up on the latest studies and medications for my health concerns
1.000000	If I didn't completely trust her, she wouldn't be my PCP.  Health care is too important to leave in the hands of someone I don't trust and/or cannot communicate with.
0.840000	My doctor has been very good these past three years in helping with my health issues. I received referrals to help with two issues. My doctor prescribed medicine for my needs. My doctor also stressed the urgency of taking my medicine.
0.520000	I dont have a primary care dr because of insurance reason but i do tryst drs however i feel they dont help everyone 
0.240000	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust doctors as I've had the pleasure of witnessing first hand their dishonesty. Doctors are a business and their primary concern is their bottom line rather than the Hippocratic oath. 
0.680000	I feel that yes my doctor may be giving me the best knowledge about my health to the best of her ability, but she is not God who is the ultimate physician. So therefore I can't trust her word.
0.360000	They're out for themselves. Whatever brings in the money to pay off their student loans is what matters, especially the kickbacks from pharmaceuticals . The American people are just cattle strolling into their butcher shop.
0.920000	I do trust my primary care physician. He has helped me through some trying times and has given me more time,during visits, than I expected and more than I have been given in the past by other physicians.
0.880000	I'm very knowledgeable about health, but I also don't have md behind my me.  I find that being able to colloborate with a doctor works better for me and my health goals.  I have more faith and trust in a doctor who I mesh very well with and can have dialogue with.
0.760000	my doctor is head of Neurology at a very large and well known teaching hospital in Alabama. My doctor has operated on my brain and I can still walk and talk but I am blind and deaf on my right side. I would rather be blind/deaf on one side than be paralyzed. I had a brain tumor and one doctor wanted to remove 100% which would have resulted in me being paralyzed. Thanks to my Mom's knowledge, I switched hospitals and neurosurgeons and I am not paralyzed. I do have 20% of tumor wrapped around my brainstem but 80% of tumor was removed by my current doctor
0.560000	I know that doctors are busy and cannot know the details of every case. So asking questions to get more information can help. I don't think it is intentional, just impossible to have another person who rarely sees me to know what will be best for my life in some situations. 
0.480000	Last year, a test result showed I had a chronic condition. The only thing the doctor recommended was a prescription medication. That's it, nothing about lifestyle changes, etc.
0.440000	I believe after being in a practice for a long time, everything is routine. I don't feel like they give as much thought into my complaints as they should. I don't go into the doctor for any old little thing, if I go, I am severely concerned. Their concern never matches my concern.
1.000000	I have been going to the same primary care physician for years.  I've never had a problem or reason to not trust him with my care.
0.600000	I do not have a primary doctor and do not trust western medicine.  Drugs that are legal are also harmful to people.
1.000000	I feel my doctors look out for my best interest.  They listen to me, answer my questions and make me feel confident I am doing the right thing.  I have been fortunate in my selection of physicians
0.680000	I trust my doctor because my doctor hasn't given me reason not to. She answers any and all questions that I have.
0.600000	I have had many bad doctors. I use a mouth guard during the day for stress, and doctors have treated me like a mental patient. Many doctors have refused to treat my infections because they have treated me before. My immune system is bad. I have had doctors call the police on me and lie, saying I hear voices and want to die. I never told anyone that. A majority of them have been bad. 
0.840000	He is young, enthusiastic and comes from a family of doctors. He's thorough and listens..he takes time to go over questions.
0.600000	First of all I don't trust to many people. I have been to a doctor in about 20 years so trust has not been built at all. From what I have seen from other people their physician is only interested prescribing drug, somehow I think that get a cut somewhere down the line. I also believe the are concern but making that money is their main focus.
0.640000	I am more apt to trust a doctor willing to listen and entertain my ideas as well. I don't want a doctor willing to take the first shortcut because that is what suits them.
0.760000	The doctor takes the time to explain, advise and council. Dosent run patients through like cattle, or make you feel rushed
0.680000	My PCP usually addresses all of my concerns, and will triage them accordingly. He's also cared for me during some more recent, complicated health issues, so I trust he knows my health concerns just as well as I do.
1.000000	My doctor was a friend of my father. My father used to be a doctor until his death. He always talked about what a great doctor his friend was.
0.560000	One, as a physician I have seen many physicians make mistakes.  I have trained myself to be objective and results oriented (preferring clinical studies to opinion)..  I have also been privy to compassionate and caring physicians and those who are less so.
0.240000	He does not listen.  He does not take my opinions into account.  He focuses on his objectives without considering other factors.  He is uncaring and does not follow standard protocols.  He literally blackmailed me into taking a drug I have serious concerns about, disregarding the threat(s) to my health that this drug creates.
0.640000	MY primary care is quite good, great bedside manner, willing to try whatever works. I've found she is better than other doctors I have seen, and is open to looking at studies, research, alternative treatments, and works WITH me.
1.000000	He has my interest and always keeps me aware of my health and what I should be aware of as I grow older. The things we must do to keep me healthy
0.640000	all doctors are just after the money, and they are all in bed with the pharmaceutical companies vying for free trips an such. write prescriptions like its going out of style
0.800000	She takes the time to read about my cases and issues before we meet.  We generally has several solution to the problem at hand....but to be honest with you I am very healthy for my age, so I only go to the doctor for an annual check up at this time in my life.
0.480000	I do think that having different insurances make a huge difference in how you are treated and what treatments are available
1.000000	My doctor is the first one to listen to me when I told him my antidepressants were making my feet and legs stay swollen and also it was causing me to shake a lot when I got hungry.  He took me off the immediately and then gave me the option of trying to survive without them or going on another type.  We worked together to get me off of both of them.  He also listened to my issue about sleep apnea and got me tested and approved for a corrective surgery.
0.760000	She appears to be genuinely concerned about my well being. She is approachable and personable. She takes time with me, listens to me, and thoroughly explains.
0.760000	I trust my doc becasue he talks to me like a person, not just throw meds at me and call next patient.
0.440000	Doctors these days are money motivated and are paid by the system. It's rigged to get people on prescriptions that kill you!
0.920000	I trust my doctor because they're always helpful and open with me, they take the time to answer any questions. My doctor has also returned emails and chats in my medical portal, so I have more trust in them.
0.240000	She contradicts herself a lot. I'm actually in the process of looking for another doctor. She never gives clear cut answers. 
0.760000	When I don't feel the doctor listens or is willing to explain I get another doctor.  My current doctor listens, answers questions and looks into my concerns.  We communicate by email and he is always certain to get back to me quickly.
0.920000	My doctor listens to me, anything I'm concerned about. He helps me adjust basal rates on my pump, goes over test results and explains any I might be concerned about. He understood my resistance to getting an insulin pump at first when he suggested it. I had been battling breast cancer and had spent several months being operated on, reconstructed, poked, probed, had chemo pumped into my system and just needed a break . A year later I was ready to talk to him about it and he got me set up with one.
0.760000	Trust by verify. I am smart enough to know not to trust my internet/google searches when it comes to my health, but I'm also smart enough to know that 99 times out of 100 my minor ailments and annual checkups are best handled by my PCP and I can rely on his expertise
0.600000	I trust my doctor because they have more knowledge in that field of study and in the pains i may be having but i don't trust them to make the best recommendation for me when deciding between home remedy and hooking me on meds for profit; and benefiting from my insurance company. 
0.760000	I mainly go to the dermatologist so I'll speak on that. She's amazing my skin has progressed tremendously. I trust her because I see the effects of her work. She's told me to do specific thing to help my skin and they have worked, this has helped build the trust between us. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because they always treat me with respect and care. When I get that type of respect from someone they earn my trust with their professional opinions.
0.680000	I trust my primary physician because he has always given me good advice and never steered me wrong 
0.480000	I do trust my doctor for most things but I do believe that doctors do not take people serious unless they can see actual signs themselves. Seems like most doctors send patients back home for a month to see if the symptoms go away or get worse. When most patients come in they have actually already been suffering from the problem for a long time but just waited to see the doctor. I do understand that some patients are lying to the doctor just to get medications or other things. It just seems like the patients really have to convinince the doctor that they really have these problems. I know it has to be hard for the doctors as well because they have to make sure they do not mistreat a patient even if that is what the patient wants. Of course, we have all heard about the few dirty doctors that have lied to patients about have cancer or other illnesses just to profit off the insurance money. We can't forgot about the many drug seeking patients that only want pain pills. That makes it hard on the people who are actually in pain or have cronic pain and really do need pain pills daily. 
0.720000	When talking to others about their experiences with their primary care physician, I know mine is better. My doctor takes what I say seriously and examines them. She makes sure that I take all the necessary tests and she scolds me when she feels that I am not taking my health seriously. I told her that I was having chest pains but that it is probably anxiety or heartburn. She made me that an EKG and based on those results, an ultrasound.
0.960000	For one, doctors go through many years of education; they strive and work hard to gain the knowledge needed solely to help others. This career is a selfless one. Also, any health and medical situation I've been in, the advice and/or medicine prescribed has worked efficiently to fix the issues. I've no reason to not trust doctors. 
0.880000	He knows a lot more than I do. With over twenty years of schooling who am I to dispute what is told, I do some reaseaech but for the most part believe in my doctor. I can always get second opinions of not totally sure. 
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor, due to a length of time with him and believe he is honest . I would hope my doctor is honest with myself, and all his patients, when it comes to my health and others health.
0.800000	I don't have much experience interacting with my physician because I'm pretty healthy.
0.600000	Some doctors feel like they should take the easy route when it comes to telling their patients what's best. 
0.640000	I had one that I know that I couldn't trust but all the rest are good people and they make sure that I have all of the information that I need
0.800000	I don't general have trust in many or all doctors, but in my primary doctor I do.  When I have my yearly physical each year, he doesn't rush me and always listens, and patiently answers any questions I might have. 
1.000000	It is a rare quality these days since I have seen at least 15 different family doctors throughout my life, and the family doctor I have now actually listens, he hugs me when I walk in, he looks for any side effects for my current medications if he has to put me on something temporarily, e.g. antibiotic, and he spends quality time with me. Even after months of telling him something, he remembers it like we just chatted about it moments ago. His memory, attention to detail, and time with the patient is extraordinary!
0.680000	I do trust my doctor almost completely, you have to if you are not going to go crazy. But I know in the back of my mind no one has my best interest at heart but me. 
0.760000	My doctor is real friendly & will answer all of my questions. She seems to really care about her patients. 
0.760000	I've been with my primary doctor for years and he's already proven himself to me. He was able to dispose sinus problems I have work recommending Claritin D and Flonase daily. Others kept referring me to ENTs who have me no real answers to my constant sinus infections.
0.600000	I need the medical advice that the Dr gives.I have no medical experience. I can always get a second opinion.
0.720000	i trust my physician because they Treating me with care and concernâ and âTaking your problems seriously.
0.800000	Ive been going to my doctor for over 2 years and feel very confident when i see her. She makes me feel welcome and cared about
0.640000	I have rarely had any issues with my medical treatments that are recommended by my doctors.  They seem to know what is best for me based on my medical history.
1.000000	He is the best in his field! He's very caring and has a great bedside manner. He's open and honest with me. He talks through things with me and I can page him when/if I need him. 
0.720000	I just got a new doctor and she seems to looking out for my best interest. I question her sometimes but everything is explained and discussed to my satisfaction.
0.560000	Some time it feels they dont  believe you what you telling. Or they seems like they so busy  and have not much time for you and spending much time with computer not with the patient. 
0.800000	I have a long-standing patient/doctor relationship with my doctor. She is trustworthy and thorough, and always takes time to ask me in-depth questions and relate to me on a human level.
0.280000	medical offices are constrained by regulations and requirements to post insurance companies, medicare 
0.960000	She is knowledgeable about medical issues in general and thorough in individual treatment plans. She also very caring and personable which puts me at ease.
0.800000	She is very thorough in her exams and tests for everything. I would rather someone be too thorough and have nothing come up than slack off and miss something. She is very knowledgeable and has not given me a reason to distrust her. She reviews side effects of medications thoroughly and even goes over medications that have been prescribed to me by other doctors. 
0.440000	I don't en general trust very many doctors, too often they are misdiagnosing or diagnosing based on getting paid from drug companies. I don't want unnecessary treatments or drugs. 
1.000000	because everytime i have went in to see him for anything he has always been concerned and always explains everything i ask him
0.880000	I don't go to doctors a lot but I'm surrounded by them,  I don't trust just any doctor in general but the few doctors I do go to, are very trusted by me.  I have seen by the times I went there that they are very intelligent and reliable.
0.800000	Because for the most part the have a pleasurable bedside manner. And I am well versed in whatever to malady may be.
0.760000	My physicans has always been very open and up front with me. I have always trusted my physician. He makes me feel confident with his diagnosis. 
0.960000	My children and I have been seeing our doctor for the last 10 years.  He always remembers everything about my kids as if they are his own.  It's as if he is part of the family.  I can reach out to him at any time of the day and I know that he will be there for us
0.840000	I had a stroke last year and the care my Doctor has provided has improved my health greatly.
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I feel their goal is to keep me as healthy as possible. Their advice that they give me is the best that is for me in that particular situation, not the best for them.
0.760000	They always are straight forward if they don't understand or not sure they will require more testing to find out what is going on and what we can do next to help or fix the issue that is going on at that time
0.720000	My primary is kind and caring.  She is also educated and thorough in her practices.  She makes me and my opinions matter.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician. I have been for years with this physician. Through his appointments, there is no real reason for anyone to have to distrust my primary care physician at any point in time.
0.400000	I don't really trust or distrust him, I am kind of ambivalent about him.  He seems perfectly nice but he's usually in quite a rush and makes me feel like I'm a hassle just for being there sometimes.  I don't like that he doesn't remember or check information in my chart, especially since it's a small practice and I've been there for years.  If I'm in for strep throat or something, he always tries to prescribe a medicine I'm allergic to and his nurse has to stop him.
0.840000	I have a long relationship with my dr. She has earned my trust over the years and is normally very accurate in her diagnosis. Her explations and communication is top notch.
0.600000	I trust God that is because they're always right you need to tell me was glad to do it myself that I just asked
0.640000	I don't mistrust, it's just that she has a lot of patients. She does what she has to do for my care, but not above and beyond the call of duty in opinion.
0.520000	I trust my doctor knows what she's doing and that we can have an open discussion.  But I usually go to my appointments armed with my latest research so I'm prepared for the visit 
0.640000	I have always had good experiences with doctors so there is no reason for me not to trust them.  I also believe that doctors are trained well and that they know what is best for me 
0.600000	I find that while my primary care physician offers thorough screenings, some of the information given at my appointments seems to be standard for everyone, rather than taken my personal medical history into account. I feel like the treatment is not always individualized.
0.800000	I have gone to my primary care physician for a long time and he has always helped me get 'better'.  I have never been prescribed a medicine that has harmed me in any way, nor have I been prescribed a course of treatment that hindered my recovery.  
0.800000	I generally trust my doctor since he doesn't speak condescendingly or brush aside questions/concerns. He answers them patiently and thoroughly. I've been researching and trying different medications and each time I suggest one, he makes sure I know the side effects, the neurotransmitters involved, and its off-label uses before filling the prescription.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because they never give me a reason not to. They show me everything I need to know. They have a website where I can see all my medical records, what test they ran and how they I did on it. My doctor is the best!
0.560000	as a person that knows a fair amount about medicine and practices i know that at times there are doctors that look out for themselves or the drug companies over your well being
0.640000	I trust the doctor to run blood work that is needed and shots that are needed. I trust the doctor will give me the right medications with the right dose.
0.600000	I don't trust my primary care physician because I never hear back from them about test results. Also because I always have to wait forever for her to come back and then feel rushed when she does come in. 
0.600000	I don't have a primary Doctor. After recent experience with my Mom being hospitalized for and extended period of time, and fighting hard for her life, the doctors kept misdiagnosing her until it was too late. She passed away because of this, so I don't have much trust in doctors right now.
0.720000	I've known and had them my whole life and things they've done for me before have been successful so i have reason to believe they will continue to be
0.680000	He's been my doctor for over 20 years. He's not the most organized and he makes mistakes but he has a good bedside manner and he cares about my health. 
0.840000	They are the experts in knowing your conditions and how to treat the conditions. Knowledgeable doctors are the best in knowing what is wrong with you they have to keep up to date with all the medical conditions that are coming up in the world today.
0.800000	I trust doctors because they have the most knowledge on what is best for my condition. There is so much conflicting information that a healthcare professional is the only source of an effective care solution. If I want to recover as quickly as possible then following doctors orders is the best method.
0.840000	I have been with him for a long time. He is honest and direct. He doesn't beat around the bush. I trust him immensely
0.600000	Sometimes I feel like doctors thinks they know more about what I'm feeling than I do. It sometimes makes it difficult for them to take me seriously and leads to them downplaying my symptoms or ignoring some of them and telling me it's nothing or I'm worrying too much.
0.520000	sometimes I think my doctor tries to make money off of the medicine he prescribes for me. I've been recommended some medication that could help but wasn't quite necessary. Persol fincial gain is a problem I find with some doctors.
0.840000	They show that they care I never have trust issues they explain everything to me that I need to know and answer all questions
0.480000	Most doctors are either trying to make money or don't take the time to fix the problem. They rely on medications to make the patient feel comfortable while making him or her more sick. 
1.000000	He answers my questions, he listens to my health concerns and then tells me what hes going to do for me
0.680000	He is local and easy to get a appointment and he takes time to listen to me and knows my history and plans my treatment according ly
0.440000	I feel like I'm just another dollar to my doctor not a person needing help. When I see her she's always busy with other things that she can't fully put her focus on me 
0.880000	I have never had bad experiences with my doctors in the past, so I have no reason to doubt them. most doctors care about their professiol reputation and will not be willing to jeopardize that.
0.800000	I trust them because we have built up a relationship in the past. It has taken time but we have a good feel for each other
1.000000	I trust my doctor completely. He has never wronged me and he is always willing to listen to my most intimate problems and give objective advice on what to do to treat any ailments I have.
0.640000	My primary care physician has practiced medicine in my hometown for about thirty-five years and is well respected. More over, he has been treating members of my family for most of that time. I trust him fairly implicitly.
0.840000	There should be a general patient to doctor relationshipâ, to where I can trust them and to where they can trust me. If I can not trust this doctor I have to find one I can trust. Mistrust can result in my life ending so I prefer to go to a doctor I can trust with my life.
0.920000	The doctor for me in question is my OB/GYN who I actually work for. I trust her due to the fact that she tells pts how it is without sugar coating anything while still having compassion 
0.760000	I have been with my family doctor for many years. She takes the time to explain things to me that I don't understand and doesn't ever do any unnecessary testing on me. She and I have a good doctor/patient relationship. 
0.760000	I usually look things up online before going to the doctor. When I do this, what my doctor and the internet says usually matches yp
0.560000	I just do I don't have that many things to say . I'm not a very talkative person. Sometimes I think they are in it for the money and cont really care about the patients.
0.840000	I find that my doctor is straight with her/his clients and does their job well at keeping you as healthy as possible
0.640000	i trust my primary physician because i have not encountered a reason not to trust her. Until you break my trust, I trust you
0.600000	At the moment I don't have a primary care physician. In the past, I've had doctors who have dismissed concerns that turned into real problems.
0.920000	I fully trust my doctors, I rely on their input and knowledge to guide me in my medical care. My doctors and I have a relationship that is long term.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he gives me options. He also tells me I don't have to do anything I don't want. So with that being said I really trust my doctor. Alot of doctors just tells you what needs to be done so they can collect the pay and mobe right on to the next patient.  My doctor takes his time and make sure I'm comfortable with the decision that I come up with or he tell me how much time I have to decide on decision. 
0.680000	I mostly trust my primary care physician, because I have been seeing this doctor consistently, and I haven't croaked yet.  For the most part, I believe this doctor has my best interests at heart.  However, as a general rule, I do not trust anyone completely.
0.480000	They are human and they make mistakes as well. They are not always right about everything.  Sometimes they don't know and they are guessing about your diagnosis.
0.720000	I have been with them for awhile so I feel confident that they can get the job done right and will provide me with the proper care and diagnosis.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she's confident and sure in what she's saying no feeling as if she lost or don't know what to do 
0.960000	My doctor is very transparent with me, I am only 20 years old so he warns me all the time about certain diseases people my age tend to catch. He is also very interested in our lives like our studies and sports, and that makes me feel more welcomed by him.
0.560000	I don't distrust my doctor so much, I just know that he is a human being and doesn't have all of the information. My doctor has a family so when he leaves the office he is not doing research on new treatments or new information. I like my doctor I just think that he is a little out of date and doesn't take the time to educated himself on new medical practices or even new nutritiol information.
0.800000	I do not go very often to a doctor, but I have the same family doctor since I was quite young, and I believe he has always done a good job helping me to maintain good health, and warning me of risks and dangers posed by my behaviors.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I feel he knows much more about medical care than I.  If he doesn't have an answer to a medical problem he will send me to another doctor that can help me.
0.840000	I trust physicians because they obviously don't want to make mistakes, since malpractice is so costly. They have an incentive to do the best they  can, although no one is perfect.
0.680000	well i should trust the person that went to study to become a doctor and they should know what they are doing honestly or they are in the wrong field
0.880000	she seems to listen and takes time to hear all my questions.  also available for emails.  her staff is also very kind and attentive
0.880000	I fully trust my PCP because I feel that she is open and allows me to play a large role in my own healthcare. When I discuss my health with her, it is very natural and not uncomfortable. She allows me to make decisions together with her and she always listens to my concerns and opinions.
0.640000	I don't know if you are not the intended addressee please notify the system is not important also with the group chat with you and I will be deleted on my phone
0.720000	I generally have a trust but I am suspicious in nature so I research what is told or I ask a second opinion if I feel the wrong information is given. I have only had this doctor for a month so trust is not absolutely at this time.
0.600000	I feel they are under tremendous pressure to move quickly from patient to patient as well as keep costs low and use certain prescription vendors.
0.520000	"I mainly distrust my primary care physician because about a year ago I was told I ""needed"" to get the HPV vaccine, which I declined after reading the side effects and there is no need for me to get it, I was left in the hospital room for 1 hour with ""reading materials"" on it and I had to go get my doctor so I could leave."
0.880000	Because she talks straight up with me she knows me i trust her judgement she's cool down to earth always there to help answers ur questions
0.680000	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I expect and believe that doctors want to help people and be honest with them about their medical conditions. But, they can be busy or overworked. They might be a bit busy and not focus as much on patients as they would like.
0.600000	I wouldn't completely trust my primary care physician or any doctor for that matter. While I have respect for their level of knowledge and expertise doctors are still just people and capable of making mistakes. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor to a certain point. Sometime I feel like he is just going with the flow and other times I feel like he is actually concerned 
0.480000	I have found that a lot of them will prescribe something because they benefit from the pharmaceutical representatives. I usually do more research on medicines to find out which is best for me. Some doctors know more or just care more than others. 
0.520000	have had diagnosis and ended up going to a specialist to be treated correctly. makes me not trust my doctor for anything serious. 
0.320000	Every single person in my family has trusted their doctor and ended up worse off for it. That is, except for surgeons. I never really have a need to go to a doctor, but I've been to a few dentists, one of which was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Filling fell out within days and their work was extremely sub-par. I had to go to a different dentist to get it fixed which cost me quite a bit. I've been with my significant other when she has went to her doctor and they literally googled symptoms. Yeah, I don't have a lot of faith in GP's. 
0.960000	    I trust my family doctor completely because he is thorough and complete in ALL of his medical dealings with me. He answers my questions and asks me questions too. If I need a specialist, he knows which ones are better than average and will tell me who to see.
0.760000	I don't see a reason not to trust them.
0.560000	I know that my primary care physician is qualified to do his job, as he has gone through the necessary schooling and training to gain the expertise for his position. However, I also realize that medicinal knowledge is vast, and that doctors only see me for a few minutes and therefore do not have the deep analytical insight that would make me fully trust them.
0.680000	My doctor is great and I trust him and his judgement. However, I always verify things for myself and do my own research as my doctor can never have the knowledge of my health history that I do - so he might miss something. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he is the family doctor. My parents go to see him and he takes excellent care of them. Just with things ive seen him for, he has earned my trust.
0.560000	It is mostly about making money in the grand scheme of things so it makes it hard to trust. I know that some are there to help people, but it doesn't help the corporate mindset of it in the long run. I wish I trusted my doctors more but sometimes you even question the diagnosis of some conditions.
0.760000	My doctor is persoble and down to earth and makes going to the doctor easy. She is also very up front about different options and treatments and doesn't give her own opinion of the product but what might work best for the individual.
0.480000	She has disregarded my concerns about genetic problems in my family that I show symptoms of having.  She believes that I'm lying when I talk about back or knee pains.
0.840000	My doctor has a great track record.  He cared for my mother and for me.  Wouldn't give him up for the world.  He has stayed true to himself and others!
0.760000	He seems to be open, honest and checks everything out!!  Takes the time to explain everything and gives me more than one option
0.800000	My doctor is knowledgeable and experienced in treating my condition. He discusses with me what the options are for treating my condition. He answers any questions that I have concerning my condition and my treatment options.
0.280000	I don't trust my doctor. They just write things and don't say anything. They want to hurry up and get out of there. They always call me a liar. 
0.760000	I lived next to my primary physician for a few years and we always got along very well, having that personal relationship was one of the reasons we chose him, and him being a younger person knowing he would be around for awhile also helped.
0.880000	They're busy and tired, but they have guidelines and responsibilities to give me the best care for me. They didn't waste all that time in school and during their career to give me poor treatment. I trust them.
0.720000	I have a physician that is not bothered by all my questions that I ask or bothered when I ask for alternative options available to me.  He explains everything in a way that I can understand and make a logical decision.
0.640000	I trust him because he's a good guy and he's kind and smart. I really like him a lot and he's good. Nothing else
0.560000	I think doctors sometimes have people's best interest but not always. Sometimes they are too busy or in it for the money they can milk depends
0.640000	Sometimes doctors can be wrong. I trust them but when ever I have big doubts I'll try to get a second opinion, just in case.
0.520000	i trust my primary care doctor. he has never sugar coated anything at all. he calls it as it is. when i was borderline diabetic. he told me what i needed to do to rathcet back. he dignosed my anixety and depression
0.720000	My doctor is an internist but also leans toward holistic medicine and we are both minimalists when it comes to the use of drugs. I trust him to not prescribe medications just to placate me.
0.320000	i don't trust a doctor that won't directly answer my questions.  i don't trust a doctor that wants my money more than he wants to help me.
0.760000	I have had the same doctor for 15 years, and he has never steered me wrong yet.  He always treated my grandma and continuously worked to help her as she had dementia and Alzheimer.
0.760000	My doctor has proven a lot of times that he tries to treat me the best possible way available and I tend to trust him because of it. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has shown me that he can be trusted. I have been going to him for many years now and he has helped me a lot over that time.
0.720000	I don't have a whole of interaction with my primary doc (barely a checkup a year), and not many problems (yet), so there's nothing really controversial I wouldn't trust about her diagnoses and prescriptions. Sometimes she does miss items in my history and wanted to prescribe something that wouldn't be a good idea, but I point this out.
0.520000	i trust my primary care physician because he is very good. He takes time to talk and listen to you. he is very nice and encouraging and honest.
0.720000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR THAT SHE WILL ALWAYS GIVE ME THE CORRECT INFORMATION EVEN IF I DON'T WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE IS SAYING.
0.840000	My doctor is kind and very well informed.  He always takes the time to explain things to me carefully and has literature to support his positions.  He takes my opinions into account and doesn't ever denigrate my own research.  It's a great partnering relationship.
0.600000	i dont typically go to a doctor something i need to start doing again in the very near future.. i was addicted to drugs and let my health go just began recovery getting back to health is important to me gain
0.640000	Doctors are trustworthy due to their years of experience and training for actual situations when the time comes to be on the floor.
0.960000	He just makes me feel like he cares a lot about me.  He is very caring and attentive to any of my concerns.
0.400000	I do not always trust physicians anymore.  I feel that money and profits are he incentive behind all medical care, and often treatments may be given that do not even help or are sure to fail just to collect the money.  I am beginning to wonder if things like cancer are just big money makers for doctors and hospitals, and there really is no desire for a cure.  I feel that now, more than ever, doctors are not curing people, they just are creating customers that have to come back repeatedly.  Every prescription drug has so many side affects, that other things go wrong with a person, and the doctor is profiting by prescribing certain drugs.  I could be wrong, but I am starting to feel this way.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she has a lot of experience in her field. I have tried the advice given to me and have seen improvements in my health
0.680000	I feel like doctors often dismiss what a patient is saying- and roll with their accumulated knowledge of what is actually happening with a patient's medical issue. You can almost see them smirk at times when you describe something.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he always does what's best for me and explains my problems and questions thoroughly. 
0.440000	I believe his heart is in the right place, but he makes sp judgements regarding care. Sometimes he says one thing then does something else, or doesn't do what he said he would do. Medical science is often wrong regarding treatments and doctors in general are too busy to keep up with the latest changes.
0.680000	I would generally assume that they are giving honest answers, and given their training and experience it would seem sensible to trust them. They would have little reason to deceive me, although some of it involves guessing.
0.680000	I found my doctor because he is agreeable to treating the thyroid with natural thyroid supplements, as opposed to most doctors (who will prescribe only synthetics, which actually harm the thyroid over time.)  My doctor recognizes my copious research into my condition, and works with me, with my suggestions, with the hope to improve my condition.
0.600000	depends on your condition and symptoms you might have to make several visits to figure out what the problems are
0.960000	I trust my physician because he has a degree and knows better than me what i need to do to be healthy. I trust that the information he gives me is accurate. i trust him also because he answers any questions i have and explains whenever needed.
0.480000	Itâs not that I feel that doctors are intentionally wrong or misleading. In most cases Iâm sure they arenât. But medicine in general is so nuanced that Iâve found when I visit a dr for something I gain little to no actual help or improvements and often just end up trying their advice to little help. I feel like Iâm playing dr roulette every visit. Usually I just end up with a bill and no new help or information and often also have to get referred to another dr cause drâs are so specialized nowadays that you canât just visit one dr for most things. So that just increases my bills, wares my time and creates stress. 
0.840000	he has always let me to kake right choices I have never had a reason to not trust him I have had him for a doctor for over thirty years still in about as good a shape as any year old man
0.760000	good stuff sweet things nothing like it cool product so hard and classic make it happened cool things rare stuff all day
0.800000	He has been a family friend for many years and is always up front and kind about everything. I've never had an issue where he has not been correct about a medical issue. He treats me very professiolly at all times.
0.520000	Sometimes I feel like he does not listen or believe I have certain symptoms and instead takes the easier diagnosis. 
0.720000	Doctors in general are trustworthy because they have a career to uphold. If they were to mess around with you, they could lose their license, or be subject to a huge lawsuit. It's important that doctors uphold the hippocratic oath, or else they won't be around long. You have to trust that you wouldn't be an unlucky few who are are exposed to a terrible doctor. 
0.800000	I have been going to the same dr for years. I have never had a bad experience.  She has always steered me in the right direction.  She seems knowledgeable and is always open to listen to what I have to say .
0.760000	I trust those medical people that I'm close to. They believe that their approach is correct, and I respect this. However, I sometimes have my own views,.. often, in fact. However, as stated, my trust is generally high.
0.760000	I trust them to do their job. They have the knowledge and hopefully the honesty to do it correctly
0.560000	I trust doctors to be careful and thorough, but a good bit of skepticism is healthy, and getting a second opinion is wise. It is difficult to put complete trust in someone I don't really know.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I am paying them to perform a service and trust that they have my best interest in hand. 
0.880000	I rarely go to the doctor because I am in excellent health. when I do have to go, I feel that the doctors that have been assigned to me always take good care of me and don't let me leave not knowing what is going on with my health or if there are any health concerns. this in turn gives me the optimistic and trustworthiness of my doctors that I can go into a health care facility and not have any regrets. I don't feel that the doctors at any time are looking more for convenience for them, than my actual health.
0.920000	I trust my primary physician because he is very thorough in what he does and has been my doctor for many years.  Any time I have needed him he has been there and properly diagnosed me.  He is not afraid to involve other doctors when he is unsure or would like a second opinion.  
1.000000	My doctor is one of the first who has taken the time to really get to know me and has been the best doctor I've ever had.
0.960000	I have been around physicians all my life. Iâve volunteered in hospitals, worked in hospitals, job-shadowed various doctors, and have numerous doctors as colleagues (Iâm in medical school). I have a primary care physician and whenever I have a checkup etc. with my own knowledge I know he tells me the truth and shows a caring side, and answers all my questions. Trust is earned, and I believe (since I am doing it), with all the education doctors go through, trust should be there, because it is a respected occupation. 
0.680000	My current physician is relatively new to me, so these questions are a bit difficult to answer. Overall, I feel my doctor has been very sympathetic and has taken my concerns seriously. She has ordered appropriate diagnostics and I feel that she has spent an appropriate amount of time asking follow-up questions. In my experience over the past decade, I have noticed many doctors spending less time with patients. I think the doctor/patient relationship, in general, suffers due to insurance regulations and company policies.
0.560000	I often feel the doctor chooses treatments based on my level of insurance coverage rather than what might be best for me. I often feel the doctor is more interested in prescribing drugs for which the pharmaceutical reps have given incentives, even though I might not need them.
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. He takes the time to actually sit and listen to my concerns and thoroughly answers every question I have.  He is a doctor, and educator, a mentor and friend. 
0.480000	My primary care physician over prescribes, he's given me so many steroidal medications for simple viral infection, just because I have very mild asthma. He also gives antivirals, orders chest xrays even when I have no noise in my chest. It's too much and too often. He also isn't informed about mental health, I tried to ask for counseling and he couldn't find a list, then when he found it half the numbers on it were no longer in service or the providers didn't take my insurance.
0.640000	I don't know my doctor very well because I don't see him that often. Only 2 experience with him. I have a genera mistrust of anyone I don't know.
0.680000	My GP is relatively new to the practice, so I have not had to see her very often, thus cannot rate her as totally trustworthy.  My encounters have been productive and useful.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in depth and uses terms that are understandable. Also she is very comforting and has a good bedside manner.
0.680000	"My doctor has a few quirks -- she is somewhat superstitious, and seems to believe in some ""old mother's tales"" regarding diagnosis methods.  On the whole, however, she seems to trust modern medical techniques more, although there are times when I worry about her judgement (""you must be a very jealous person -- you're quite ticklish"", said by her with little or not evidence that she is saying it as a joke, for example)."
0.840000	I go through great lengths to pick a doctor. I get recommendations, read reviews, etc. This makes me pretty confident from the outset. I prefer women Doctors, which adds another strand of confidence. When I first meet with a doctor, this gives me my final vote of confidence. Whatever the doctor shows me on the first visit, I assume is who they are. Because, usually on that visit, they are on their best behavior. If they rush and don't have time, then I will not stay with that doctor.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been treating me ever since I was little. My mother was taking me to a different doctor when I was younger and he was repeatedly misdiagnosing my illness. My mother got frustrated and switched doctors, the one of which is still my current primary care physician.
0.800000	our doctor is well known in my community and he is our family doctor. my mom trust him, so i trust him too. but talking to other doctors, i test them first by asking a lot of questions before i can trust them
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician. She seems to know her stuff and has a good bedside manner. She is always there to answer any questions or concerns that I may have.  
0.840000	I have a new Dr. He has been very thorough to let me know that I have his time and will be upfront and honest when it comes to my medical needs. 
0.560000	I like to get a second, third, and sometimes fourth opinion on things. My primary care doctor isn't God and I don't entrust my health to her. Her services are valuable, however.
0.960000	She has been my primary care physician for a good many years and she has shared with me a great deal of her own personal information insofar as it is relatable to things that I have shared with her
0.920000	I dont have a primary care doctor. The reason. I dont have one at this time. Past situations was gret amd he treated mw with respect and he was truthful. He made sure that all my questions was answered and i that i understood each and every process.
0.680000	I'm not sure they always have my best interest at heart. On the other hand they are willing to give their medical opion.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because i have been seeing her for over 2 years now.  I feel that she knows me and my diagnosis very well so most things she suggest such as treatments and medicines i believe is always in my best interest. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I think he has my best interest at stake. He takes time to listen to my concerns and actually tries to help me. 
0.280000	As of late, my doctor has been pretty dismissive of my health concerns. He is very busy and spends almost no time evaluating me. Because of this, I am currently searching for a new doctor. I feel that he does not take what I have to say seriously. 
0.840000	Firstly, I tends to trust people. For doctors who are well-educated and respected, I trust most of them. As I experienced, most doctors are very nice and professional.
0.800000	My doctor is compassionate and open. She is willing to take the time to answer any questions I have. She is reassuring too.
0.720000	I trust my family doctor. He has been working with myself and other family members for many years. I am an active, healthy individual, so when something is wrong, I trust him to provide and recommend treatment.
0.640000	My doctor is really smart and does care, so I trust that they're not going to offer me something I don't need. At the same time, they're pretty dismissive and patronizing, so that's a little discouraging.
0.960000	I have known my primary care physician for awhile and he is a family friend. I believe that he does everything he can to make sure I am getting the best treatment possible.  Not only for me, but for my whole family since he is all of their doctors.  He seems to take his time and is always available for questions.
0.840000	I feel like my doctor would never lead me in the wrong direction when it comes to making decisions just based off past experience. Sometimes I don't always agree with his decisions and he knows that but we always do what we both think is best for me.
0.960000	My NP seems to have a good grasp on medications I am to be prescribed, giving me confidence in taking it. If it works out not so well, she is on board with another medication that might help instead.
0.640000	Sometimes I feel doctors in general cannot recommend the best course of treatment for a patient if he or she doesn't have health insurance.
0.960000	My primary care physician suggests what is best for me.  They have never steered me wrong in the time that I've been seeing them.
0.520000	I believe they are trying to do a good job but the problem is they are always over booked so you have to be your own advocate and try to understand your condition.  You should also ask questions you have in mind.  After all it is your own body and your own health.  
0.720000	She is easily distracted by other things it seems.
0.640000	I trust my Doctor because they've had many years of experience. I trust them because I know nothing in comparison to them. They took an oath to be a Doctor and I have to rely on that for their honesty.
0.600000	I wont go back cant go back to the way things use to be today is the day I have to go home and cook dinner for my family and if I don't they will be really mad at me and will not talk to me at all for a week and I will be very sad
0.600000	You should never trust anyone completely. That is just being lazy, and letting someone else do the thinking for you. You should always put some effort in to evaluating things that other people say/do, regardless of how much you trust them.
0.720000	From past experience I have time is more important to doctors than a thorough check up. They d do a quick and tell you to come back if your health doesn't improve
0.760000	I have been to him for over a decade as has my spouse. He is a great doctor
0.600000	"What I would say is I trust science and how it develops information, which can inform decisions. Through persol experience in seeing how doctors have misdiagnosed my family members and in hearing numerous stories of similar situations from family and friends, I would say doctors often don't care about good outcomes for their patients as much as they should. They can seem uninterested, cold, and have little involvement in the actual ""caring"" part of health care. That being said, I know there are many good doctors who do care, though many may be overworked and somewhat desensitized. "
0.600000	I like how my doctor treat me. And when I ask him for something he does it. And I don't have to wait when I need things.
0.640000	most of the time i agree that they are trustworthy, but i can think of times they just want to prescribe something and not care too much about other possibilities 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they have not given me any reason to not trust them.  I believe in the basic trust of professiols that I interact with.  If I didn't trust them I wouldn't go to them for treatment.
0.720000	I believe my primary doctor knows me well enough to know I want honest answers and the real bottom line, and so he does not sugar coat anything 
0.760000	I trust the doctors i see because of the training and education they receive. I do think there is a bit of opinion difference between different doctors but i think overall that is marginal in diagnosis. I do believe that in general almost all doctors and nurses are out for the patients best interest.
0.600000	Doctors in general seem to be more jaded with their profession. They seem more concerned with simply medicating and moving patients along rather than spending time to determine what the best course of action is. I have seen it with a lot of doctors as well as vets for animals. It could be because there is an increased number of cases that they process, I'm not sure. But it's alarming.
0.800000	I have to look into what doctors say because even though they mesn well they can be qrong sometimes too
1.000000	I had a really bad bout of panic/anxiety attacks over a year ago and that's when I reached out to my nurse practitioner. He has helped me through this whole process and still to this day. He is always there when I need to contact him and I have had to try a few different medications until I found the one I am on now (Paxil). He has helped me to understand everything I am feeling and has helped me make a complete 180 in my life. I am forever thankful for my nurse practitioner. He pulled me out of a very hard time, and it was something at the time, that I knew nothing about. So that was also scary to deal with at the time. 
0.800000	I do trust my doctor because she is extremely honest with me and patient with me. She is still new to me since I have had her for 6 months but I already trust her 
0.680000	I trust my primary care doctor as he is a quite a bit honest person, and very direct on any health topics, and provides different options and explains everything very clearly and answers thoroughly any questions I might have, and even he listens to me and try to understand my feelings on some sensitive topics. He is also one of the highest rated doctor in my area as a trustworthy doctor. So so net net my experience with him is very good that is why I trust him.
0.560000	I have never been very close with any of my physicians, and I have had several miserable experiences with medical bureaucracy/billing, so I am more apt to view my exchange with a physician as a business exchange. 
0.600000	Just started going to this doctor and haven't established a relationship between us yet.Therefore I need to get a feel for my new primary care physician
0.720000	I trust them to do the right thing because they studied a long time, took an oath to help patients, and should care about people.  I have to trust them.
1.000000	I have had my PP for a few decades now and he is always on top of any of my concerns. He knows me and has all of my medical background info. 
0.560000	I am neural. I neither trust nor distrust my doctor, however I put the most trust in myself and my family. They know me better.
0.880000	I trust primary care physician. I have no other options for healthcare for who else will I trust. I think the current Healthcare System is great and I'm glad that Obama Care takes care of everyone. Without Healthcar without Healthcare no one will live a good life.
0.640000	I have had the same doctor for almost 30 years.  He has always been there when I have needed him for myself or my kids.
0.360000	I trust my doctors because they take the time to make sure I get a reminder call for appointments, they are friendly and don't mind taking a little extra time to explain something to me if needed, I even have a doctor who constantly tells me not to worry about his fee. 
0.560000	I do not visit them enough, but from the doctors i've visted, they were always pretty honest when it came to my health.
1.000000	I've had the same Doctor for about 15 years and she's never steered me wrong , she's always had my best interest at heart . She is Really good at her job and it's not JUST A job to her
0.680000	I think they are prone to subscribing meds for everything versus trying something else. They don't take into consideration long term effects.
0.520000	Doctors tell you what is good for them financially. They may have stock in a certain type of medicine so they prescribe that medicine more often. It's always best to get a second or third opinion.
0.520000	I distrust my doctor because he may only be doing it for money or trying to finish up his work so he can move on to the next patient.
0.800000	My physician always takes the time out to answer my questions and explain things. She is very honest and blunt.
0.600000	I mostly trust my doctor, except when he seems to have more patients on his plate than what he can handle with the utmost care at the moment. Sometimes my appointments feel rather rushed and I know he has not had adequate time to alyze every possible solution to whatever problem I may be dealing with, and that he is simply giving the fastest and easiest solution rather than the best one. I know that he is competent and knowledgeable and has always taken care of me, but I wonder sometimes if better care and more close attention is available elsewhere. 
0.320000	I believe the medical field is too dependent on money, creating big profits while minimizing care to patients.  This trickles down most heavily on the doctors who make the call to run certain tests or not and to dedicate enough time to caring for patients.  I believe there is too much pressure on doctors to overmedicate patients as well.
0.880000	I trust my physician Because she asks the right questions and helps me out. She just doesn't rush through the appointments
0.440000	She acts as if she cares more about her world than mine. Sometimes she seems closed which discourages me in wanting to contact her about my issues 
0.560000	I don't understand the question clearly. I don't know what to write so I wrote this down. Please explain to me more.
0.480000	I believe that the doctor may have your best interest cat heart, but that doesn't mean that the doctor knows everything .
0.440000	"I think he is too focused on certain health issues (my weight) and not focused enough on the things that are causing me to have poor quality of life (chronic migraine, chronic pain from arthritis) even though my poor quality of life is a major factor in why I am overweight - because I'm uble to exercise without pain, I have no energy to cook healthy food, etc. etc. But people don't like ""fat chicks"" and doctors always seem to focus on that as a #1 problem no matter what. "
0.800000	He is very thorough and he always give you options.  He calls to make sure you are okay after hours. He is always giving suggestions on cutting the cost of your prescriptions. 
0.440000	in this day and age many physicians are more beholden to outside interests such as insurance and drug companies than they are to their patients.
0.560000	I don't know where the doctor is coming from or what motivates the doctor. I am young so the doctor would probably overlook serious issues and may misdiagnose me
0.640000	I just acquired a new PCP and he seems to be very thourough but by the book with no deviations. He doesn't have any faith in holistic or healthfood supplements
1.000000	I hVe had medical issues in the past and he was completely open and honest about all he options available to me whether good or bad
0.800000	I trus' my physicians because I'm convinced that he is there for his patience. He has good bedside manner and has been in business a long time
0.600000	M doctor is big on test results but not as good as chatting about life. He is getting better. I talk with him more each time, and tell him what I need.
0.600000	I don't have a regular primary doctor due to not having health insurance so I see a general based on income doctor when I'm sick.   
0.680000	I believe most doctors only have the patient's best interest in mind. I just don't believe you can trust any one completely.
0.440000	My doctor acts like a know it all.  It seems like they are in a rush most of the time.  They could be more thoughtful and considerate.
0.840000	I'm not an expert as to what is okay for my body. If I thought I was dying, I would certainly think about their opinions of possible diagnosis or treatment that was available to me.
0.800000	I trust him because of how long I have known him.  It has been so long and I have seen him so many times that the trust grew.  I know about his family and other things about him.  Plus since he has done many procedures on me and I am healthier because of them I trust him.  He has not let me down and is there for me when I need anything including just to talk.  He takes his time with me which is important.
0.520000	Sometimes it seems as though doctors look at you as a number first rather than a person. This makes me not have complete trust in doctors that I come across because it's almost as though they don't really care what's actually best for me.
0.800000	I've known my physician for over 25 years. She is smart, thorough and compassionate. She is an excellent medical professional and I recommend her to others quite often. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I trust my hospital. My hospital has a really good reputation. I have been them for years.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is kind and competent. They care about me and my health. They are concerned about any issues I have. We have good communication between us as well. She is also very concerned about other parts of my life as well.
1.000000	FIRST, HE IS WELL EDUCATED AND HAS TAKEN AN OATH.   SECOND, I DID RESEARCH ABOUT HIM AND HIS BACKGROUND.  ALSO, I CAN TELL BY HIS PERSOLITY AND TALKING WITH JIM.
0.800000	My doctor is a caring person. My my doctor is very good at getting to the bottom of what is going on. I trust my doctor.
0.640000	I generally trust that my doctor is trustworthy however during my pregnancy I did feel that I wasn't always presented with all the information or options due to her preconceived notions about my twin pregnancy and age. 
0.440000	My doctor sends me for ultrasounds that I don't need. 
0.680000	She spends more than 5 minutes during appts and seems to listen when I have problems or issues that need addresses
0.920000	I trust my doctor because she is always looking for and telling me about things I can do to improve my health. 
0.840000	I trust my physician because he is honest and upfront with information regarding my health. I can count on my doctor to be honest no matter what
0.800000	I trust my doctor because that is what she went to school for. She has been trained in a way that people that are not doctor arent. 
0.800000	I have a general positive trust for my doctor. I don't think she'd ever intentionally give me misinformation or mislead me. I've never had a concern with this and feel like she's always helpful and informative.
0.640000	I have been having a growing feeling that my doctor is not doing all he can to help me lower my blood pressure. The medication I am using now, the fourth, is not working very well at all.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician, because I have make seen remarkable results in their work. I have have been a patient with this physician for more than 5 years'.
0.920000	I trust my oncologist to treat me in a way that if best for me. She makes sure I understand everything and takes the time to listen and respond in a way that is clear to me.  I feel that she cares and does not rush me through my appointments.
0.800000	I have been seeing the same doctor for over 20years and find him to be very knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions. He is comfortable explaining why and how.
0.600000	I trust my doctor but i also have a mind of my own and follow my intuition. My doctor is very caring and informative.
0.840000	Has always taken time to listen and ask questions about my health and shows compassion. I feel like if he needs to he will refer me to a specialist.
0.960000	Whenever I've gone to see him for an issue he is able to help me. He prescribes medicine that works for me and if I need to follow up with him he tells me so.  He's thorough and I feel confident that he cares.
0.640000	He's has been my doctor for as long as I can remember, when he retires I will have to find a new one
0.680000	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE THEY GIVE THEM THEIR BEST TO  HELP  IN OUR WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY AND GOOD . THEY ALWAYS SUGGEST GOOD THINGS .
0.600000	well I think the doctor does his job as he was trained to do but he isn't god and doesn't always know what illness is present  right away
0.600000	I think doctors get rushed by office managers. I also think insurance reimbursements to doctors are diminishing so the doctors are having to see more people in the same amount of time and this results in subpar focus and attention. I also think doctors get into a 'groove' and tend to prescribe the same things and give the same diagnoses without giving extra thought to if there is more going on than it seems at first. 
0.960000	My doctor treats me like a friend, breaks everything down so I can understand her. She is extremely friendly.
1.000000	If I have an issue my physician doesn't perform one test and then stop, like other physicians have. She's also very friendly and makes sure I understand everything she says. 
0.960000	I have been using the same doctor for over 20 years and have experienced a range of issues in which he has guided me well and with great empathy and no judgment. I have had no reason to question his judgment as he has been very wise and when he has insufficient knowledge, has directed me to people who have uniformly been knowledgable. We know each other well and have a great history.
1.000000	I trust my physician because I have known him for years. We used to work side by side in the hospital. I know without a doubt that he will tell me things honestly even if it goes against what his normal protocols are. I am fortunate to have this relationship with him.
0.600000	I trust my primary physician to an extent. I feel that my physician is too busy to really give me a thorough exam and is super quick to keep moving. I feel that there is no way there can always be a right diagnosis
0.760000	I trust them because they work relly hard to help us. Troughout time, we pay many pateientsd to help us really much. I love it. Going tot he stoer
1.000000	He has helped me in the past in dealing with health issues and he acts more like a friend in our appointments rather than someone just trying to force something and being very indifferent when it comes to our conversations. He actually speaks and you can feel his concern and his understanding. He knows how to be a friend or at least act friendly.
0.520000	I think Dr offices have become more of an assembly line, long waits and I just think sometimes they are so rushed patients do not get enough time to get all their questions answered and time to gather information about medications and treatment options in depth.
0.680000	my primary caretaker is very awesome! She is always down to earth and gives it to me straight. The only negative thing I have against her is she is not for using medicine as much. If it can be done, she would rather the body heal itself naturally. This is ok sometimes but when I have a dance concert coming up there is just not enough time so I don't want to have to argue about giving me medicine. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor implicitly but he has alot of patients and his time is severely limited with each patient. It's the one thing that annoys me. But he is excellent at his practice even if his time magement is lacking. He still mages to be caring and attentive but the rushing in and out does sometimes give me pause.
0.600000	been with him for a long time and feel confident he is trying to do what's right and look out for my best interest as a doctor.
0.880000	I have only seen my doctor a few times since we moved to Kentucky but she seems to be very upfront and honest about things.  She also has to be just about one of the kindest people that I have met since moving here.  
1.000000	I've been seeing my doctor for a number of years and she has never been anything but honest with me. If she doesn't know the answer to one of my questions, she will admit that and then help me find the answer. She always takes her time and goes over everything with me thoroughly, and I never feel rushed when I am in her office. She knows quite a bit about my persol life and always asks me about my family when I come in. I feel like we are friends.
0.800000	My doctor has far more knowledge about medical conditions and treatments than I do. He seems to genuinely be interested in recommending the best solutions for my health needs. For these reasons I have to trust him.
1.000000	my Dr. is like my best friend offers time and thorouhgness.i can ask or tell my Dr. anything. she has much patience and dose not rush me.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in detail. She always asks if I have any questions or if I understand. She also takes her time with me.
0.400000	My PCP is always trying to push a medication that I don't necessarily need and always jumps to prescribing meds instead of looking for other solutions to a medical problem.  At times they also forget to physically examine me, just simply prescribing a medication.  There are drug information pamphlets all over the office and this puts doubt as to whether my PCP has a conflict of interest or not. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he is always willing to take the time to answer questions I have about medications and treatment plans and he works with me to make sure I get the medications that my insurance will cover and he checks to see if there is one that they cover more of the cost. He also explains why he makes medical decisions, like prescribing medications or doing certain tests for me before he does it to make sure I understand completely what the reasons for doing it are and the benefits and risks of it.
0.800000	I have total trust in my physician,  If I didn't, I would find another one in which I did trust.  I have never felt misled or lied to,  I feel as though they are looking out for my health, and helping me stay healthy. 
0.720000	They are sometimes in a hurry. They don't always have all the answers. I value  second opinions or even thirds.
0.840000	though I've only been seeing this dr for a short time, she is thorough and compassionate takes her time with me at my appointments
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has never given me a reason not to. He's always very thorough and he gives me options when appropriate. 
1.000000	I trust her because she answers all of my questions whether they're dumb or not. She goes through each problem I'm having thoroughly and breaks it down for me so I understand what she's saying. 
0.640000	I've only been with this doctor a little over a year, she seems pretty good and She had me believing that she knew what she was talking about
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him since I was a kid and he has been truthful and honest ever since. He has also been my family's primary care physician.
1.000000	My physician is always very transparent with me. She always asks if I have any questions, and she always answers them so that I understand. She never seems in a hurry, and she is always very friendly.
0.760000	My doctor is a seasoned professiol. He has really good persol qualities. That makes me feel will do no harm when it comes to his medical advice.
0.840000	Of course I trust my doctor. What am I supposed to do otherwise? He or she has the education and experience to be able to best help me.
0.800000	I have never had any issues with any of the doctors I have seen.  They have all seemed to empathize with my issues and appeared to care about my well being.
0.640000	"I believe that most doctors are educated in their field, but have their own expert ""opinion"" when it comes to certain topics. For example, I had an allergist suggest to me that I shouldn't nurse my daughter past a certain age due to her dairy and egg allergy."
0.920000	My doctor is very trustworthy I've never had a complaint yet I'm not sure if I ever will he's been in service for over 50 years
0.360000	SHE DOES NOT LISTEN TO ME. WANTS ME OUT THE DOOR AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. RELYS ON BLOOD WORK AND NOTHING ELSE IT SEEMS. I ASK HER QUESTIONS AND SHE WILL ANSWER A COUPLE, BUT THEN GET SIDE TRACKED EASY OR GET ME SIDE TRACKED SO THAT I DONT ASK THE QUESTIONS AGAIN.
0.560000	I trust that my doctor can provide basic care and advice but I do not believe they keep up-to-date on new treatments.  I'm also not confident in their knowledge of things outside their specific scope of practice.  As with all professions, some doctors are very good and knowledge an a majority land somewhere in the middle of competence.
0.480000	"I believe that many doctors rush through exams in order to get to their next patient and end their day and go home. this is not true of ALL doctors of course, but a great many I am sure it's true. I trust my doctor to see the glaring issues that are wrong and to suggest treatment for those, however, I would greatly push for more testing or ask more questions if I feel they don't ""get"" what I'm there for or if they seem to brush it off. Bottom line is that you need to be an advocate for yourself because these doctors see so many patients, they do not care on a personal level. You have to force them to see you as human and not a number in an office."
0.520000	My doctor and I disagree about pain management.  I would rather live with some pain and not be on pharmaceuticals, and he thinks it makes more sense to take pharmaceuticals to reduce (but not eliminate pain) despite negative side effects.  I think many doctors don't understand what it really means to manage a chronic pain problem.  Taking pills everyday is not everyone's first choice.
0.640000	sometimes i feel like they don't want to help you, or they just don't care about the patients. sometimes as well we just don't want to trust someone we don't want to trust so i guess that is why they don't trust. when we do its because we believe that they are credible
0.720000	My PCP is thorough and detail-oriented, but I also feel like he dismisses what he sees as minor issues too easily. He's also quick to send me elsewhere to a specialist if anything even remotely complex comes up.
0.720000	I have been going to my primary care dotor now for 17 years.  I feel that he has my best interest at heart.
1.000000	I trust my doctor b/c when I first started seeing her I was a mess and she ran labs on me and found a ton of my problems and worked hard to fix all the problems and every 6 months she runs labs on me to make sure all are in the level they need to be.
0.640000	i don't know them well and they're a conventiol doctor who wants to deal with symptoms rather than root causes, which isn't something i agree with. i do my own research and speak with a relative who is a doctor as well.
0.840000	I trust doctors to make the best decisions for their patients if they are given all the information that is available.
1.000000	I trust my doctors because they've always been honest with me.
0.800000	he is very knowledgeable and always provides different options and talks about possible side effects and is a great listener,not in a rush to get to the next patient.
0.720000	I would not patronize a doctor in whom I didn't have trust.  That's counterintuitive.  Why would I go to a professional, then discount his advice/opinion.
0.720000	I trust my doctor and like her but I would not place complete trust in just one person.
0.480000	I trust them as much as I should. What that means is if they are clearly pushing a prescription for something I don't think I need, I distrust them. If they are actively pushing minimal treatment I trust them more because I think that my health is their priority opposed to making money by seeing me over and over again or by prescribing more drugs.
0.840000	Ive been going to my doctor for over 10 years. He has gained my trust. He explains everthing so that i can understand
0.960000	My doctor takes time to talk to me about things going on in life (even politics) and not just my physical condition. Also she follows up with emails about how I'm doing and once when I was sure I had a bladder infection, all I did was email her and she prescribed what I needed. She explains treatments well and asks questions to make sure I understand. 
0.920000	I have been going to the same physician for many years, and have built a great deal of trust with her.  She understands me and my health history and needs.  
0.720000	I trust y dr to help me decide whats right for me. She has never steered me wrong and makes sure I'm doing what I need to do
0.800000	It's simply in their best interest to do their job to the best of their abilities. There's little to gain and a lot to risk if they do otherwise. Of course they're humans so they're not perfect and things happen sometimes.
0.600000	I don't currently have a primary care physician at the moment, though I have had a few over the years. I've generally had good experiences, but I also take modern medicine on the whole with a grain of salt. The doctors themselves I trust and believe to be good people doing what they feel is in my best interest. But I think the profession on a whole is quicker to treat symptoms than address causes, and put figurative band-aids on things by prescribing pharmaceuticals to address most things. I've persolly solved some of my own medical issues through my own research and by simply applying that knowledge to take better care of myself through nutrition and exercise. I don't think those basic things are offered up and encouraged often enough - but that may be just as much a reflection on our quick-fix society itself who wants a fast and easy way out of a problem rather than putting work in themselves. So in that case doctors are often doing what their customers want.
0.600000	I think most doctors have good intentions. Why spend all that time in school just to mess people up? 
0.800000	My doctor has known me since I was young and knows my entire medical history. He always takes the time to go over my symptoms and questions with me.
0.760000	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to my needs and concerns. She takes the time to thoroughly explain my conditions and the medications I'm taking. She has a great bedside manner and is really nice.
0.600000	I trust my physician because I know that she know what's she is doing. She handles it very carefully and has respect
0.840000	I trust that he is doing things for a good reason.  I believe that he takes his practice seriously.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor because I've gotten second opinions and my doctor always  seem to take her time she knows everyone by name and takes her time with you
0.680000	I trust that my doctor tries to do well by me.  However, I think sometimes she is in too big a hurry or is distracted.  I can not trust her completely because she is only human and can make mistakes.  I have to take responsibility for my own health.
0.680000	I trust that they are doing the very best they know how. And I'm very aware of the fact they they are only human and they are limited in there knowledge and expertise on all subjects
0.880000	I am uninsured and haven't seen a doctor for 14 months. When I do, I like my doctor very much. He is thoughtful and attentive, speaks in normal civilian language, not medical terms I can't understand. He takes all of the time I need.
0.960000	I trust my physician because he is very nice and kind. and I feel that he wants the best for me. He gives me no reasons to not trust him.
0.480000	I think sometimes they care more about money than actually helping people.
0.840000	I think I could trust my primary care physician to give me the care I need. I don't have one currently but I should probably find one. I would prefer a female doctor so I can talk honestly about my needs and concerns without feeling like I am being treated like it's 'all in my head'.
0.760000	For the most part, I trust physicians but I do believe in getting a second opinion where treatment for cronic health issues are concerned. I saw both of my grandparents almost die because of a doctor who was more concerned with his bottom line than caring for what they needed. They were heavily over medicated and taking medicine they did not need. They were both in need of a pacemaker but he would not refer them to a cardiologist. The family had to take over and get them to different doctors so that they could have a healthy life instead of slowly wasting away.
0.520000	they always wanting to try new medicines and treat you like a guinea pig, I am not willing to be one
0.920000	The doctors that I have are all outstanding physicians in their fields.  They listen to me and we work as a team in coming up with my health care plan.  My primary care physician really takes her time in weighing all the information and goes over with me what they recommend and listens to my input so that we can create a positive experience.  I trust her because she has shown that my health is of important concern to her.
0.800000	I trust my PCP because she always tells me the truth, even if it is not what i want to hear. She has never lead me wrong. She takes the time to listen and do a full assessment. 
0.760000	I like him and have used him for years. I trust him.
0.640000	well sometimes its hard to trust on your primary care physician because they cant guarantee your health back and even other doctors wont  take responsibility they can just try their best to take care of a person
1.000000	I trust my medical staff to tell me what is wrong or right. They take the time to explain the information to me and ask me if I have any questions.
0.760000	sometimes i feel like my doctor prescribes medicine unnecessarily just to pacify me. but he does ask a lot of questions and try to be as thorough as possible and refers me to a specialist when he's unsure of my condition.
0.440000	I do not trust my doctor. It's not that he is a bad guy, but he was taught in school to throw pills at most situations. I would rather take a holistic approach to my healing.
0.800000	I have a very nice woman as my primary doctor. I can trust anything she tells me to do or take.
0.800000	I have had my PC for 15 years now. We have a relationship that is based on trust and friendship and he is always there to discuss any problems I have. He is an excellent doctor and has a great manner with patients.
0.680000	I do trust my physician, but only when we engage in a discussion and come up with a mutual plan for my treatment. If I do not advocate for myself, I feel like he may not put forth as much effort in my treatment
0.800000	Ive known him and have been seeing him for a long time. I have no problems telling him exactly what bothers me. I trust him to be right most of the time.
0.520000	I feel that I have complained about the same symptoms for several years and only recently has the dr started to listen to my valid complaints. I understand that people have a magnitude of problems, but getting answers is very important
0.640000	Cause sometime they can be wrong about  some stuff about you if yoy go to anthor place it different resulr
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician, but have no problem with trusting a doctor with my care, as I have in the past.
0.480000	I am forced to go to a clinic by my house that rarely lets me see an actual doctor. Many times when I go for specific reasons or health issues they ignore those and don't do anything for it. I am always forced to see a nurse practitioner who always has to look up stuff in books to treat me.
0.520000	I know that they know what they are talking about but I feel that I get lost in the shuffle of other patients. I feel like they are quick with me to move on to the next person. I really don't know what to believe when it comes to what my doctors are telling me. I believe about half.
0.320000	"The doctor's clinic I go to often wants to run a bunch of tests which I think are often unnecessary. And because my insurance isn't that great, I end up paying thousands of dollars. Last year I had to pay $600 for a lyme disease test that my dr. thought I should get because I garden a lot. Every single time I go, a $40.00 charge for 'smoking counseling' shows up on my bill. But it is literally a five second conversation of ""You smoke?"" and me saying yes and the doctor saying ""you should quite"". No joke, nothing more than that 5 second sentence and they charge 40.00. I think it is a huge scam. "
0.760000	I do trust my primary care physician basically because she has never given me a reason not to trust her.  I think she is kind and caring, and she has never misled me in the past.  She has been helpful any time I have gone to see her. 
0.360000	"I distrust most of the medical community in general because they assume that they know more than their success rate would corroborate. Their procedures and treatments are more of an attack on the body, hence the 'negative side-effects"". They rely almost entirely upon laboratory ""medications"", while scoffing at most tural treatments. They're drug pimps for the pharmaceutical industry. Most pharmaceuticals are the result of back-engineering things found in ture that are free. However, you can't have a trillion dollar industry informing people that they can use tural altertives at a small fraction of the cost (if not freely) and that the altertives don't cause sty side-effects. The medical community is great for dealing with body parts, but they're failing miserably when it comes to actually curing diseases. They focus more on making the patient FEEL better while they still have the underlying condition."
0.800000	My doctor is upbeat and personable.  She is younger than my previous doctor who was wonderful.  I trust her because she looks out for my best interests and does not insist I take drugs that I deem unsafe.  She is very knowlageable and competent.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he is a human being and doesn't want to see me suffer; he wants to help.  I do believe that he will give me different options that will make the most money for him though.  As long as it helps me, I don't really care.  There may be some options he won't mention due to the fact that it requires me to go to someone else, thereby not giving him the money.  I do believe medicine is based on money, sad but true.
0.960000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because he takes the time to listen to my questions and the information that I share regarding how I am feeling.  He is very concerned and elicits my input when attempting to understand my health concers.
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor because she has also been my parents' doctor for a long time, so I can trust her. 
0.840000	they are nice  and help you when  you   have  diabetes or when you are sick  and they are nice and special and caring
0.560000	I trust them because they are good and the customer service are really nice I will always trust them
0.480000	I do not see a doctor often. I only visit a doctor when I am sick. I can't afford to see a doctor on a regular basis
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she explains everything in detail. She gives me time to process and makes sure that I understand the severity of a health issue. She also gives me time to ask any questions that I might have and is patient with me as she answers my questions. She is comforting and a great person. All these qualities make me trust her and feel comfortable when being seen by her. When I have questions outside of the doctors office I am able to call her during her work time and she will answer my questions. She is the definition of a great and caring doctor.
0.680000	I generally trust medical professionals, but I know that they are also humans with their own self-interests.
0.480000	i don't see my primary care physician too often. he's a decent guy, but i think he's more interested in sending me off for tests than anything else. he doesn't seem to know that much himself, it's always more tests.
0.800000	I have been going to the same doctor since I was born and now my children go to the same one. She has always explained things clearly and given options and tried to do her best for us. 
0.720000	My doctor is thorough, but he can't know everything. I can't totally trust him or any doctor, knowing that they may not be able to find the answer. 
0.760000	She was one of the first one listen to my full range of symptoms and treat all if them, not just one or two.
0.480000	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to talk to me to understand what my symptoms are and determine what the course of treatment should be.
0.680000	Doctors have the training and knowledge to make good decisions about my health.  If I feel that a doctor is not thorough or knowledgeable, I'll find another doctor.
0.840000	I have been going to my doctor for a very long time now. When ever I have a pain or any other problem with my health I head over to his office. With my major back pain issues he has always been stright forward with me. Always telling me the truth straight to my face even when I might not like it. He has always been correct about the cause of the pains or illnesses. His procedures and getting better plans have had a one hundred percent rate of effectiveness and I have always gotten better when I follow his instructions. I trust him because he gets things done correctly.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because they do give me all the information I need to maintain good health and that all depends on me doing my due diligence and ask all the questions I should be asking about my health.  She's never late when I arrive wait times are no longer than 15 minutes and she does listen. My only blip is when they couldn't tell why I suffered the emergency, but it's not like she doesn't want me to know...right now they just don't have the answer.   
0.800000	the doctors  are the best in all areas. the help much peoples in differents topics. the take their time and they change in thing beest
0.720000	I don't trust medical doctors very much. The reason is because I feel that there is constantly contradictory medical advice and I think that many of the practicing doctors were taught information that is now old and they are stuck in their ways. I would much rather have a young doctor than an old one because old doctors are mostly ignorant to advances in science and how to treat illness before it comes on.
0.600000	I can't put all of my trust in what a doctor says until I meet them.  If they take their time treating me and looking for a solution then I can trust in what they are saying.  If they are late and then come in the room, in a rush, then I have difficulty trusting them.  They typically tend to rush through looking over me and seeking a solution to what is wrong.
0.560000	I think generally I do trust my doctor, however, I think that ultimately after listening to my doctor any decisions about my health are basically mine and I don't always agree with my doctor. I had doctors who would tell me I needed procedures, that I don't think would have been right for me, so I I would seek another doctor. I also feel like some doctors are only interested in money and aren't interested in your well being.I have had doctors bill me for things I didn't get or charge me for cancelling an appointment.
0.720000	I don't currently have a PCP, but in general I trust doctors a little but not totally. I think that to some degree big pharma makes it hard for them to be totally unbiased in their decisions. So I think that have my interest in mind, but I also like to do my own research to back up what I am told.
0.840000	I one-hundred percent trust my primary care physician as well as all of the employees at the practice I visit. He has done an excellent job at helping me maintain my health this fas. 
0.600000	Feel doctors treat overweight patients a little differently.  Also led some by drug and insurance companies. Too many unnecessary tests.
0.640000	They are just doing their job and are human some times. They can forget certain things either due to stress or distraction from other cases or patients 
0.680000	My primary care physician asks questions that implies they're trying to dig deeper into my symptoms to see what is wrong. They run tests that may help figure out what's wrong with me.
0.400000	my appendix had burst and my dr couldnt diagnose it
0.600000	I trust and do not trust primary care physicians. I trust them because they are the experts at what they do and then I don't trust them because I know they will say anything to charge and get more money out of you.
0.480000	I have actually gone to my doctor self diagnosed, only to have him tell my I was wrong, but later realize I was correct. I've also caught him being dishonest by neglecting to tell about specific treatment options, and even explaining options incorrectly.
0.960000	I have a basic knowledge of the medical field, they went to school for this, therefore their knowledge trumps mine.
0.640000	I mostly trust my primary care doctor. I trust them in addressing my concerns and treating my problem appropriately. Sometimes, I feel like doctors differ over what treatment option is best so I get a second opinion.
0.520000	I had a procedure done approximately 1 year ago. It could have been done in office with just a numbing shot. Oh no, the doctor wanted me in the OR with a local . I finally talked her into a spinal  just to shut her up. I am still angry and upset over the bill and the doctor not listening to me
0.840000	I trust my primary doctor because I never usually have anything wrong happen when I go to him, when I explain my problem he is usually able to tell me what is wrong. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor because she knows that sometimes treatment options work differently for different people and she lets me know that I might not get the results I want but she has always been willing to work with me when I need to change a treatment option without hesitation. 
0.960000	I have chosen my doctor with care. He is kind thoughtful and though. He listens and remembers what I have said to him. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor (cardiologist) very much. He has a great reputation and has a great amount of skill and knowledge.
0.600000	"I have not seen this primary care physician that long and feel that they aren't as familiar with my background as they could be. I have also been denied certain medications that I feel I need just because they ""are not comfortable"" with prescribing them. I would have to go to a different doctor just for that then. I miss my ""old familiar with me"" doctor as well."
0.640000	Sometimes doctors does not explore all the options available and they sometimes treat people differently because of race or status
0.960000	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me and I have never had a reason to not trust her. She is good at her job and a very nice person, so it is easy to trust her and her opinion
0.800000	ive been seeing the same doctor for almost my entire life. he knows me and my situation very well. has always been good to me and my family.
0.800000	I generally trust doctors and I never asked for a second medical opinion (unless I noticed that they had a bad attitude towards me and towards other people in general).
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him.  He has also gone above and beyond in taking care of the rest of my family, including handling a couple of emergency situations wonderfully.
0.520000	I trust her because I've had hey for years and she hasn't let me down yet I've had two kids successfully with no problem
0.720000	I mostly trust my primary care physician. She is patient, answers any questions that I have, & seems to suggest the right course of action for me.
0.840000	It's not working its very important to be with the best sites that are not have the wiki l a lot more
0.800000	I feel that my primary care physican has my best interests at heart. He spends a lot of time with me and answers all my questions to my satisfaction.
0.880000	Because she is up front and honest and she is not going to beat around the bush about my health she tells it like it is rather i won't to hear it or not 
0.480000	He has made errors before because I have a specific chronic illness and see a separate specialist who treats it. My GP has increased medications to a level that is harmful due to my illness, or prescribed meds or treatments that contradict or react with my other meds. He also put me on three medications to lower my blood pressure at once, which caused my bp to drop so low so quickly that I had seizures.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because so the medicines which have been prescribed have helped me tremendously. They continue to help me as long as I take them properly.
0.840000	My primary care physician has been efficient but thorough the last two years that I've been seeing her. She listens to my concerns, offers treatment options, and describes pros/cons of available options. Her manner is very pleasant and she balances speaking in vernacular terms and medical terms so as to neither come across as confusing or patronizing. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor , If I distrust my doctor I will replaced him. I think he take care about my health
0.760000	I know they are in the positions that they hold because of extensive education, experience and trust building with patients. They are able to answer all of my questions in a credible and convincing manner. I have had no breaches of trust to make me react otherwise.
0.880000	Doctor is open, honest and explains all situations and answers my questions and concerns. Provides for all necessary tests and labs
0.720000	I trust doctors in general because they have a deeper understanding of the things I don't know about my body.  For example, I have chronic heartburn and I trust that my doctor can share information about which treatment is best for me.
0.600000	I trust her to make the right decisions but feel extremely rushed when seeing her with any concerns or worries
0.680000	I generally trust him, but I don't completely trust everything they evaluate. He is just a person with his own biases after all. but I generally think of him as credible
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she had been there for me and helped me through my problems. She is always very understandin and willing to listen to me. 
0.840000	I trust my Primary care physician, because Iam still alive. My always shows patience and kindness while staying professional
0.440000	All doctors want is money. Long ago has patent care went away and all people want in the medical field is just money 
1.000000	My doctor is a great physician who cares for me, talks to me and always puts my health as a top priority. He asks questions, let's me talk and dialogues with me about any concern that either he or I have. 
0.840000	It's usually a different doctor every time, and they are used to treating a lot of people who are poverty stricken but when they get to me they usually are very kind. 
0.600000	I beelive that he knows what is best for me. He has taken care of his education, and has been training in his life in order to make sure he knows what he's doing. That is something that lets me think he is a professional,
0.800000	doctors have the education that is why it is not easy to become one. all the classes you have to complete.
0.400000	I have had bad experiences with doctors and have been misdiagnosed. I have unfortunately had doctors with God complexes who believed they were right and would not listen to me as their patient and it turned out I was right all along.
0.680000	I think most of them try what's best for a patient. They might not be right, but their heart's in it. I think they make mistakes, but as long as they're not too stubborn to change what they're doing.
0.640000	I believe in no man 100%. They make mistakes just as I do and I can't see looking to someone else to validate me.
0.440000	Because i have family in the medical industry i have seen how cold they have become from being a caretaker. they get burned out and tired and start treating like a regular job versus a healing profession. 
1.000000	Speaking to my doctor is like speaking to a family member. He's very open and honest, but has a very warm bedside manner. He makes me feel very relaxed, and I know he always has the best suggestions for my health and well-being.
0.800000	The biggest reason I trust my primary care physician is because she has not given me a reason to distrust her. Her advice and treatments are well explained and they work. 
0.560000	I don't currently have a PCP, but have had two children in under 2 years, so I am answering in regard to my OB/GYN. Unfortunately, the Banner office I go to does not allow me to see my regular doctor all of the time and forces you to rotate through doctors. There are 3 that I really like and trust and the rest I do not know so well. Also, during my latest labor (Sept 2017), the doctor told me we needed to use the vacuum because my son's heart rate was dipping. I pushed him out on the next try, after she had already attached he vacuum. Even though it wasn't used to extract him, he now has a calcified bump on his head from the vacuum suction. I do not feel like I was given other choices in the moment. 
0.200000	It seems like doctors only want to pass out pills. That is a bandage and dose not resolve your problem and has side effects
0.760000	My doctor is above the average but still I've had to correct him regarding important details of my medical history as I've had to to varying extents with many doctors.  I do find that he is patient and receptive, however.  I've definitely had worse but my doctor is not ideal for me.  I'm not certain that exists.
0.560000	In general I almost never just trust one opinion from one physician. Specially if they are older as there is a chance that they are not up to date with the information (speaking from personal experience). I prefer always getting a second opinion and do my own research to learn as much as possible.
0.960000	My PCP is thorough, honest, and caring. She makes sure is accurately and completely explains everything. 
0.800000	When i go to the doctor they listen to everything I have to say.  They answer all my questions.  They will also ask any follow up questions that they need answers too.  They don't rush through the appointment.  they take all the time that is needed by me and by them to come up with a solution to whatever the problem is.
0.840000	They tell you whats best for you and how to take care of yourself.And the best ways to help yourself
0.600000	tnhey have the knowledge and training and should know what is for the best for thier patients whether they do or not
0.840000	I put complete trust in my doctor because he has been my doctor for many many years. He knows all about my health and medical needs. He is straight forward with me. He has never lied to me to benefit himself.
0.800000	I have a very good doctor, we have been together for over 20 years. H knows my case history and is a very good doctor
0.760000	In general, I will trust what my doctor has to say 90% of the time, and may do more research on my own about their suggested treatments. They have the experience to know the different treatments, surely more than I know doing research. If I ever feel like my doctor doesn't really have my best interest in heart, I will get a second opinion.  The more I've seen one doctor in particular, the more likely I am in trusting what they have to say to me. 
0.720000	A doctor is only one person, and sometimes people make mistakes. It's also impossible for one person to have all the relevant information about an issue. My doctor is competent and I like her, but I always do my own research to verify what she's saying. I like to get multiple opinions, so even if my issues aren't serious enough to seek out a second opinion in person, I'll at least do my research.
0.800000	I think he's looking out for my best interest. Checks thourough an yet d doesn't do excess. Just the right amount
0.480000	"My doctor has made huge mistakes on forms like making me get shots for school he thought were required when the form actually said I was excluded. He also signed below the signature line which was odd. He says contradicting things like ""inside your ears it looks PERFECT"" than says I""m suffering from inner ear inflammation. "
0.720000	I trust my family doctor because I have had health issues come up or things that have bothered me for awhile and other family doctor's couldn't seem to help fix or get the right medication for the problem but this doctor has helped me every time, so I feel she knows what she is doing and I trust her.
0.760000	My doctor takes the time to get to know me and my life. He will allow my to voice and problems or questions I have about my health. I would like to think that my doctor actually cares about me, because that is the impression I get. 
0.440000	I trust doctors to some extent to in most cases try to help. However I do feel they sometimes think of themselves or money they make from kickbacks 
1.000000	I have complete trust in my doctor. This is mainly because I have a long history with this doctor. I also go by my gut feeling that he puts the patient first and not himself. He shows his passion in his job and does not mope around the clinic. To me, that means it's not all about the compensation. Anytime I had an ailment, he knew right away what prescriptions and directions to give me, and they all worked. I also trust my doctor because he gives off a calm and reassuring vibe. If I had to choose among doctors, he would always be my pick. 
1.000000	he is a good man. he is always there for me when i need him even when he is occupied by patients. n/a
0.600000	I often feel as if they are already thinking of the next patient. It is usually a hurried experience.
0.680000	I trust medical professiols except in the rare instances where I know more than they do. That's scarily common in mental health fields, especially.
0.840000	I known my doctor for over 10 yrs and they will go over my meds and tell me if it's unhealthy and who is better and make sure I'm happy or not
0.640000	I trust my doctor to do his job and explain my medical options. It's not his job to decide for me, so I wouldn't take his recommendations automatically.
0.760000	I normally trust them as I have high hopes and respect to them.I know if they were fooling me because I can somehow sense it. And i always asked my sister about it.
0.680000	because i think sometimes they are un honest and dont know what they are doing or what they are talking about
0.600000	I feel that my PCF is a kind person and has intentions to help yet does not want to realty invest in the thought and process needed to truly uncover my medical issues. Specifically my secondary infertility issues. I have seen her twice and she can't seem to ever move things along in the process and sort it out. I am extremely discouraged by her lack of urgency.  
0.200000	"For one, I don't have insurance and live well below the poverty level, so I don't have a PCP. Medical care is in an emergency only. But, when I did have a PCP and insurance, my doctors were in the room for 5 minutes or less and just gave a dx as whatever was the fastest and most convenient thing at the time. Also, I have a mental health history, so anything they couldn't explain or dx, they just attributed to me being ""mentally unstable""."
0.640000	People can have favorites, flavors, ideas and treatments. So someone can easily get into the routine of recommending a favorite treatments. Also, people can be out of date in their ideas. 
0.800000	he has been on top of my care and takes the time needed to understand the symptoms and challenges that my condition entails.  Seems up on current practices and thinking inthe medical world.
0.560000	Strongly think this is a good app and I think I am loving it and getting real good at it and I thank you for this opportunity
1.000000	I trust my Dr completely, his communication with me is always good and I have complete confidence in his communication.
0.760000	My trust is based upon how well she listens and the feedback she gives. I believe the good health means less drugs and more healthy eating, exercise and spiritual peace. She believes that also.
0.920000	I trust my doctor completely.  She is very up to date on things and knows how to explain in my language.
0.600000	I haven't been seeing him long enough to completey trust him.  I had a doctor before him who I thoroughly trusted but she left.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. If there's ever a time that I don't, I don't have a problem getting a second opinion from another doctor. That doesn't mean that I don't trust him as a whole, just that in a certain situation, I would like to know that he is consistent with another doctor. I feel that I can trust my doctor because he seems invested in me. He know about me personally, and he shows true interest in my life.
0.920000	My doctor came back to clinic. Shes the best, you don't feel rushed at all ever.  Se tajes her time and g I es through everything
0.720000	I've had a couple I have trusted and a couple I have not. My last physician in Hawaii I trusted a lot. I went in with severe pain in my intestines. The nurse wanted me to immediately go to the hospital for a colonoscopy. The doctor asked me some questions, looked at my medical history, and came to the conclusion that I had a non serious condition that could be treated with antibiotics. He gave me the choice of accepting his recommendation or going to the hospital. He explained the pros and cons of each. He gave me reasons for his recommendation and I went with it. He was correct in the end.
0.920000	I trust my doctor to give me what I should know about my health although you still have some douth no matter who
0.800000	My doctor haven't given me a reason to distrust me. He tell me his personal struggles and I tell him mines, but he might do things for himself also. I wouldn't doubt that or blame him, but he haven't given me reason not to trust him
1.000000	I have never had an issue with my physician, she's always right with her diagnosis. She is also extremely thorough 
0.560000	He has resolved several medical issues that other doctors could not help me with in the past. He ask questI on to get to the heart of the situation
0.600000	I chose neutral because I currently do not have a primary care doctor. My medical needs are usually taken care of at an Immediate Care center due to health insurance.
0.400000	I do not fully trust my doctor because it's just hard for me to do. I like to do my own research and find tural homeopathic ways of doing things.
0.440000	I think that a lot of doctors would rather have you get on some medication that might help you some, but would cause side effects that would make you have to continue going to the doctor, rather than really emphasize the importance of changing the things that people eat, so I don't trust them too much in that regard.
1.000000	In the time I've been seeing him he has told me things that I NEEDED to hear rather than what I wanted to hear. He always spends as much time as is necessary with me to make sure I understand my options and instructions. 
0.520000	"I am not willing to allow a physician to ""put me on"" a batch of drugs that have  adverse side affects so I am not the type of patient most doctors want.  I will listen to their reasons for the recommendations and then weigh what I may know about a drug and whether my symptoms are bad enough to take the risk of the side effects.  "
1.000000	I trust my primary doctor because he is very thorough with his examinations.i trust.my doctor. I will continue to see him as my doctor. 
0.560000	They are just guessing on how to fix whatever ails me.  It's always a gamble trying a new medicine. 
0.520000	i trust them but im skeptical bevause they are sometimes rough and rude and they make themselves out to be not trusted
0.720000	I have always had good experiences with doctors. They have all been professiol and seemed to be competent.
0.960000	In my case, my primary care physician is also a good personal friend that I've known since before he was my doctor.  We built a relationship of trust before we had a business relationship and that has carried over into seeing him as a doctor.  Any time I have had an issue I have honestly expressed it to him and he has given me straight answers on what my options are and what the possible outcomes were.
0.600000	I don't go to the doctor often and have no medical condition. I don't have a doctor I see regularly for anything so I don't really have anything to base an answer off of.
0.720000	i have to trust them becuace they are looking out for my welfare. when dont follow instructions they why would i go see them.sometimes i think they dont understand the problem i have and i might second guess thier reasoning behind what they say
0.880000	"I trust my primary physician because to say the least he is a realist. He keeps things honest and it's not just about saying what he feel's is required to be said, he gives me relatable examples and tells me personally things about his life and hose around him as well and it gives me a much more relaxing feeling and the ability to trust his word. He doesn't always come with the ""Dr. Talk"" that people whom are not in that field doesn't understand. he gives me advice medically and personally."
0.680000	When i have a doctor's appointment i make sure to write down the name of the medicine that im taking
0.720000	The most obvious things that have changed the perception of medicine over these last forty years include high profile cases of physician fraud, drug abuse, drug pushing, malfeasance, gross malpractice, even murder.   What in the past was often hushed up, or discounted as highly unusual, have now become grist for the media mill.  To say that physiciansâ images have been tarnished by these instances would be an understatement.
0.960000	I thinks he cares about his patients and he knows what's he doing. He has helped me many times and I trust him
0.800000	i would never have complete total trust in a doctor. i have to look things up myself, i have to be able to confirm or deny
0.560000	I feel like it's a treadmill these days. The doctor listens to you the customer about your problems and try to give you a quick bandaid fix to your problems and most of the time, just tell you to wait a few days for your immune system to take care of it. I trust their authority most of the time, but feel like there's some hidden information not given as well.
1.000000	I know my primary care physician outside of the office, and I know what kind of person he is. I trust his judgments for my medical care because I know he is a good person who truly cares about other people and wants what is best for them. I know his family, and how he treats and cares for them. It puts me at ease when I am dealing with him in a professiol capacity.
0.840000	I trust both of my doctors, MD and psych. They have a great track record with me and my treatments. I don't know what else to say.
0.800000	i trust my primary care doctor because that's the doctor i've had since i was born. She has all of my medical records. So, its just easier to stay with her and trust her knowledge of me.
0.840000	I feel very lucky to have the PCP that I see. She really listens to what I say and answers my questions. She doesn't rush through things to get me out and on to the next patient. She is thorough and I am always provided written documentation about what we discussed and any changes to medications. First thing she does is read the nurse's notes of why I'mâ there and the notes made at my previous visit. I get nervous any time I have to see any of my doctor's, but she and her staff treat me with respect and dignity which usually calms me. I have no complaints.
0.880000	I trust them because it is their job.  I do realize that everyone has flaws and sometimes ulterior motives. However I still trust the doctor.
1.000000	I think that my doctor takes the time to listen to me . She does a good job going over each problem and giving me options . She will explain each one and recommend what she thinks I should do . She is good with following up . If I feel like there is a problem she doesn't just write me off . She takes the time to explore it and make me feel like it has been addressed . She always gives me as much information as possible . If I am not comfortable with something  she is willing to try another avenue . I feel like all in all she puts me first in my health care . 
0.600000	Because some are sneaky and are just trying to get as much money out of you as they can which is evil and should not be aloud 
0.760000	I believe he is looking out on my behalf.  He is very down to earth and honest.  He gives me the facts and I do my best to understand anything he tells me.  I do believe him, I do not think he tries to give me any false information.
0.800000	He asks me questions about myself and my family with genuine interests. He asks me my opinion and explains things to me without me asking. His team seems knowledgeable and coordinated. I feel like more than a number or source of income.
0.760000	I trust my Doctor because whenever I felt anxious or had doubts about my medical condition she was always available. She always gave me reassurance when I needed it.
0.760000	Because she is thorough. I have been going from doctor to doctor before I find this one about medical problems. She was the only one that ordered tests and found my problem, which was a spil cord tumor.
0.840000	I trust my doctors because they are honest about what they tell me. They know if something is wrong and I think they give me there honest opion about if there is something wrong with me. If I can't trust my doctors then who can I trust  
0.760000	She's always been helpful and willing to explain things to me. I haven't run into any issues as of yet
0.800000	My doctor has been in the area for a very long time.  My husband and I both go to him.  He has actually helped find the right diagnoses for something that has been overlooked for many many years.  He is thorough and takes his time talking to me about what I am there for.  He is well respected in the area.
0.680000	My doctor has never been wrong about my diagnosis when it's something specific to me. Alot of time when many people come in with the same issue they just group everyone together as having the same thing.
0.720000	I believe that doctors are trained to be trustworthy and have taken an oath to put their patient's interest above all. Of course, there are some doctors who fail at patient interaction in any number of ways, but I believe them to be the minority.
0.960000	I trust him b/c he has proven that he cares and wants to find out what is wrong with me no matter what.  
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he takes the time to explain things to me such as test results or what needs to be done to make me feel better and why. Also he is very observient and notices changes I make in my appearance.
0.600000	I think some doctors are gifted in what thry do. And really perform and do an excellent job rather than other doesn't know the situation to what is been explained to them.
0.600000	Sometimes doctors Can lie and sometimes they can to the truth. I think you should go to more than one doctor to figure out what's wrong with you.
0.560000	My doctor over the years I have lost trust in him he used to be throughout and take his time with me and discuss issues but now when I go I have to wait an hour and a half for him to be in the room for not even 2 minutes which really upsets me because I have to drive 75 miles each way to get to my appointment.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very smart, well qualified, and she knows what shes doing. The office that I go to is also very well known, and its been around for years so I trust them. They are all very professional, clean, and enthusiastic in their practice their.
0.640000	In terms of situations that aren't serious sometimes it would seem as though doctors may give a patient the runaround in order to make more money or help out other doctors or institutions.
0.800000	My doctor allows me to ask questions and help decide the right path for my physical and mental well being
0.640000	I like and trust my doctor, I've been a patient of his for several years. I trust his judgement and diagnosis although I also know sometimes doctors are just guessing. 
0.880000	My primary care doctor has been helpful to me throughout my life and has always made a point to make sure that I am getting better. 
1.000000	I love my doctor,I recommend everyone to my doctor but it took 4 doctors before I found him,before I found him I hated doctors they did not listen or care what you say my doctor will sit and talk to me for 20 mins he is great and he does not push pills he believes in fixing your self or your diet,he is great.
0.520000	I just feel like he doesn't listen to my concerns sometimes. He also seems distracted a lot. And he doesn't spend very much time with me, either. 
0.360000	I am in control of my health and I like to do research on what the doctor is saying rather than blindly trusting them. 
0.760000	I typically trust doctors who have a lot of experience. I trust my doctor to know the best treatments for me, but I don't always expect my doctor to know everything about me. Sometimes, doctors don't believe what I have to say if it is strange or abnormal. 
0.480000	I don't believe my doctor would deliberately lie to me or mislead me but I do think that at times it just isn't convenient for him to answer my questions or explain things thoroughly to me - that doesn't inspire trust.
0.600000	I don't see my primary car physician that often, but when I do she always seems kind of rushed and mechanical. For that reason I don't completely trust that she's explored all of the options, or given me the knowledge I need to know what my options are, but what she does do for me I trust is effective and not harming me. 
0.960000	My doctor has taken an oath to provide the best care and help ensure I am healthy. I trust their advice and guidance in terms of my wellness. I have no reason to believe that my doctor is anything but straight forward with me.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because of his past experience and the care that he has provided for my family throughout the years.
0.560000	Doctors can be wrong, I have been in scerios where I have gotten multiple diagnoses from  multiple doctors upon getting a second, and third opinion.
0.760000	Sometimes I feel the Doctor has too many patients to concentrate fully on my medical results. I think they are preoccupied or overwhelmed with all they have going on in their own lives
0.480000	Seems like he is into giving out pills like he is influenced by drug sales. So could be conflict of interest there.
0.800000	I've been going to my primary care doctor for years and she hasn't given me any reason to not trust her.  To the contrary, she lets me know that she is going to do what she thinks should be done, regardless if I like it or not.
0.800000	I don't have any specific reasons, I think I am just inclined to believe what my doctor is saying is accurate. I almost never doubt my doctor, or any doctors I have seen.
0.680000	I believe that most doctors have the patients best interest at heart and they want to help them get better and give them good medical advice
0.680000	Sometimes not everyone has your best interests in mind. Your doctor is suppose to assist you with your health but at the end of the day they still have to make money so im unsure about completely trusting them
0.600000	He is a family friend but I personally do not like his bedside manner. He is a good doctors but he can be cold and brusque, which I do not like
0.800000	Have been a patient for 18 years, he has never steered me wrong yet. He is very dedicated and thorough with me, taking his time with me at my scheduled appointments. I even have his cell phone number in case of an emergency.
0.840000	I think they know what is wrong with me and give them my complete trust. I think that if a doctor don't know what is wrong they should ask another doctor for help in figuring out what is wrong.
0.600000	well fost off I just want to say that in no way shape or form I have a primary care physician and I also have little experience with doctors
0.800000	I have not seen a doctor in 8 years.I feel stress often but after seeing what kind of stress they go through,I will take on my own issues.
0.760000	I trust my doctor to the fullest and I think she has my best interest of all I don't think see would lie to me at no point at all and she never lie to me so far don't think so would now
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he has always looked out for my well being. I never had any issues with him and I trust his medical advice based on prior experience.
0.720000	I trust the doctor because that is his job.  I have never been given any indication that he was unable to perform his duties.  I would hope that I would be given the same courtesy.
0.240000	I have lost over 90% of my sense of smell due to a deviated septum I was born with and has gotten continually worse. It has changed how my voice sounds, makes it difficult to breathe through my nose at times, gives me sinus headaches and makes it hard to chew. After get a cat scan I was told by my doctor it was nothing more than allergies and prescribed flowze. Lost all my trust only adding to the multiple reoccurrences of bad doctor stories I've had.
0.560000	I have a lack of trust with my GP.   She recommends one thing while my gynecologist, neurologist, and allergist recommend other avenues 
0.560000	Don't have a primary care doctor now but when I did I was never sure if he knew what he was doing. He once ruined a trip for me with a bad diagnosis.
0.640000	Because it seen that you have to take the doctor words for it when you bearly can trust them that's why it hard for me to just up and go when they won't ask about if okay or nkt
0.560000	my doctor gave me blood pressure meds that i almost died from, when i told her that it has an adverse effect on african americans she said she did not know about that, even though it was all over the paper.
0.760000	Since I feel good and get cured after a doctors visit i feel like the doctor is helping me to stay healthy.
0.600000	My doctors are the professionals, & I am supposed to be able to totally trust them.  Since I am a diabetic, I have to take more insulin than my endocrinologist actually tells me to.
0.720000	I trust that most doctors are just trying to be helpful but I still double check things with my grandmother since she's a nurse
0.560000	I do not really like my doctor but it is hard to change to a new one. I live in a small town. I trust many doctors though because they have a lot to lose so they tend to try very hard to do their best.
0.800000	Choosing the right doctor is often put in terms of trust. Can you trust the doctor to do the right thing? Start off with the idea that even very good doctors do the wrong things sometimes. There is so much to know. They may not know as much as someone elseâbut the good doctors will go out of their way to learn what they may not know.  And they will ask for help from other doctors. I would trust some doctors to treat some conditions out of their area of specialization more than I would trust a specialist in that field whom I knew was careless. They can be relied on to approach a medical problem carefully. I cannot describe what goes into having good clinical judgment, but it is a real thing. I am not sure exactly what quality of mind and character it involves. It is a kind of being sensible.
0.840000	They have never steered me wrong in talking with me about my care. Always talked to me about everything and answered all my questions thoroughly
0.440000	Sometimes I feel like the doctor doesn't believe me when I say I have a problem and she makes excuses as to why I couldn't have this issue because of my age etc. She doesn't even try to find out if there is an underlying issue and just thinks I want drugs which makes it hard for me to get treated for things. 
0.680000	I do trust my doctor because he/she knows best.  Or shall I say doctors are more knowledgeable than me about medical terms.  If I won't trust the doctor how will I be treated.  I always believe that prevention is better that cure.  Only doctors knows it.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because this person has had many, many years of school, and dedicated their life to making sure they explore, examine and treat those that are in their care for different illnesses. I have little medical knowledge so I always listen to my physician. However, that doesn't mean I listen blindly. I always do my own research and get a second opinion.  
0.640000	I don't  have a primary  care or physician I use walk in clinics  some I can't give you that much information  so you see whom available 
0.680000	I am a skeptical person about everything really. I know it's not called for a lot of the time but I just can't help it. I often question whether or not the doctor has my best interest at heart. 
0.760000	One of the reasons is because the physician seeks to find ways or things that are beneficial. Sometimes certain information is held back for the sake of not telling everything in order to gain more power that gives the physician the upper hand. That is my speculation based on a lot of things that are taking place today. 
0.760000	My rheumatologist is the doctor that I trust the most. He is very knowledgeable and it is obvious that he cares about his patients. He actually save my mother's life at one point because he recognized that she had a rare condition that the other doctors had not seen before. He is very honest about treatments, side effects and possible outcomes and works very hard to find the right treatment for the individual patient.
0.800000	I have been going to my PCP for over 20 years now exactly for the reasons above. He takes his time with me, asks questions, and is honest about how he feels. That's why I still go to him.
0.920000	She is a family friend. She takes the time to check on me as a person and not just what is written on the chart for the reason I am visiting her.  She touches up on multiple aspects of my life as far as family, physical activity, emotional state, and other things that may have an influence on my health.
0.640000	He seems to know what he is talking about when it comes to my health. He does take the time to ask questions and does a thorough checkup. What I find that frustrates me is he never calls back and it is hard to get an appointment.
0.800000	My Primary care physician works with a team. I feel confident that he can handle any medical situation I might have, he also consults with the team if necessary.
0.800000	i have the up-most trust when it come to my doctor he has always been straight forward about my health and any treatment that he think i my need 
0.480000	My physician has forgotten medical information about me, and had to be retold. Also, my physician has said offensive things that seem to step across the line of patient and doctor relationship. I haven't switched because I'm only living here for one year and hopefully don't get sick until I move. Finding a new physician would take too long to get in. So I don't really trust my physician.
0.560000	I do not feel that I have known my primary care person long enough to say whether I trust or distrust her. I would need more time to make a determination.
0.600000	The major issues I've experienced with my health are things that are not easily diagnosed and sometimes doctors still don't think it even exists. So I'm brushed off quite a bit and that makes me wary of trusting a doctor.
0.360000	I currently do not have a primary care physician, but the one that I previously had did not seem to care that much about me or understand how I was feeling. I distrusted her, because she didn't take much time to listen to what I had to say about my thyroid, symptoms, and she didn't act like she wanted to help me. I felt like my previous primary care physician treated me more like a number, rather than a patient.
0.800000	was very close to my last primary care physician who has unfortunately retired but he set me up with his primary care physician who is great and I go to a great hospital with an excellent reputation. I feel like I can articulate any issues and questions necessary
0.960000	I trust my doctor to the full extent because I have been going to this doctor for more than 16 years. He speaks up to other physicians to help with anything that gives me issues.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a medical doctor. He once brought a medical condition to me that I had ignored for a long time and he persistently asked me if I had certain issues that I was in denial of. He recommended getting some blood work done and I am so glad I did because it turned out I was actually pretty sick on the inside. Once I started a treatment for this medical condition I improved so much. I trust him for reasons like this. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because my doctor would like the best for me. My doctor would help me take care of my health by telling me what healthy foods to eat. They would also help me by telling me what vitamins i can take.
0.680000	I trust in my primary care physician to a certain extent . Sometimes, I do not always agree with everything that she says. But, I feel she thinks she is right and that is fine but I can agree to disagree with her. I do not always agree but I try her way first .  If it gets so I do not fully trust her opinion then I will find another primary care physician. 
0.840000	The reason I got a lot of trust n my doctor is because he goes step by step to explain each n everything he is doing to me or what was done
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he cares about my health and needs hes very patient and understanding he keeps me informed
0.840000	My Dr. seems to be pretty open with me in regards to my medical care. He gives me options pertaining to medications
1.000000	I have known my Doctor for many years and I trust him.
1.000000	My PCP has done nothing but good in my eyes. He always does whats best for me. I switched doctors and my current doctor reduced the dosage of metformin form 2500 a day to 2000 a day during my first visit because it was an unsafe dose. My previous doctor did not know that.
0.720000	I generally trust my doctor.  I know he is looking out for my best interest.  I typically try to avoid the need for any medications to take regularly, and I do believe there are problems with certain medications that are pushed on patients.   
1.000000	I have no negative feelings or connotations toward my primary doctor. I trust in his treatments and diagnosis
0.760000	I like and generally trust my PCP as a person, because he seems honest and he really does know a lot.  However, looking at him as a physician, I can't honestly say that I trust any doctor completely.  This is mainly because of the constraints put on them by insurance and ideology as well as the influence of Big Pharma, but it also has to do with their patient load and how exhausted they might be.  I know I don't think well when I'm exhausted, and neither will any doctor.  
1.000000	I trust mu doctor because he is thorough.  He explains all the possibilities and potential consequences when making a diagnosis and offering treatment.  He then asks allows me to make the decision given the information presented.
0.760000	She takes the time to explain things and answer any questions I might have.
0.800000	I trust my doctor based on his personality and how he talks to me.  If I didn't like him or didn't trust him I would, and have, changed doctors.  
0.720000	Because we think they are knowledgeable and we believe in them and put our trust in them and expect them to provide us with proper guidece
0.760000	The reason that I trust my primary care doctor is the he tells specifically what I need to do to take care of my health
0.600000	"I trust most doctors in general as long as they can explain why they recommend the things they do. I need more than a ""you need to do this"" explanation."
0.680000	I trust that my primary care physician will tell me the truth about my health and well being and making sure that I'm dieting and exercising daily 
0.600000	"I haven't seen a doctor in over a year; I had to have stitches in my arm due to an accident. I'll use that experience to explain here. The doctor I saw was very trustworthy, in my view. The first thing he did when he saw me - before he even said a word to me - was put on gloves and poke/prod a lipoma near my eye. I had seen my doctor about it years previous so I knew it wasn't anything to be concerned with, but having a doctor who goes ""hey, this guy is here for stitches.. but I'm going to take a brief moment and check out this other thing that I'm not even going to put on the record"" really made me feel as if he was looking out for me. I really appreciated that. When we got to looking at my arm, he explained how I was lucky because if the cut had been just a small amount deeper I'd need surgery (of course today I couldn't use the terminology that he did, but at the time I fully understood everything he was saying -- if you're a redditor, it was very ELI5). However, when speaking with my normal doctors.. sometimes it seemed as if they weren't really paying attention to what I was saying. For example, when I was in the military I told my primary care physician that it didn't matter what time I would lay down, I could not go to sleep. His response to me was ""go to bed earlier"". He eventually sent me to see the base psych and I was given medications that helped."
0.600000	My trust is mixed. I've had great experiences with my doctor where they were very caring and compassionate and helpful. There have been other times when it didn't seem likes they cared about me at all. One time they abandoned me in a room so they wouldn't miss their tee time.
0.960000	I have never had a problem with any medical advice he has given me.He has always listened to what I have to say and answers any questions I have.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has never steered me wrong. He's been great in answering my questions and is quite knowledgeable. He's very intelligent.
0.600000	I don't have a primary physician however I don't really trust doctors. They are more concerned about making money.
0.640000	I think doctors for the most part are very knowledgeable and truly care about their patients, but I think that the way our healthcare is run, doctors don't have enough time to fully develop the best plan of action.
0.480000	I can't really say weather or not I trust my doctor because its usually always different. That's what I think I usually want a 1st 2nd and sometimes 3rd opinion 
0.600000	Well when I first met my doctor 2 years ago he is adding me head to toe tell me you don't things I need to do things I shouldn't do for the first month and now it's just pills pills pills pills to cure one paying the Cure that pain is almost like a pill Pusher and I don't like medicine all the time there's a lot of Earthly things that you can do besides taking medicine all the time so my concern with the doctor is maybe I should change doctors I don't know then I spend maybe a few minutes with you but I understand they have a lot of patience but it just in and out of the door when you want to ask a question it's like okay what else do you need not very concern so maybe I should change doctors that's
0.760000	They could be lying to me in order for me to spend more money with them.  They could fake that I have an illness, only to steal more money from me later on.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician, because he is careful with me and medication (I'm very sensitive to medications).  He understands when I do not want to continue on a certain medication (because of the side effects I have read about or have been told about by other medical professionals).  He spends time with me discussing my health issues and immediately responds when I send him a message via my health portal.  He remembers my health record and seems to know my past history even though he has hundreds of patients.
0.640000	I have to rely on my primary care physician, because I I don't have any other options to get medical advice. I am distrustful of him on some level, because he is driven by his business interest first very often.
0.440000	My doctors tend to rely more on pharmaceuticals to treat common problems, even when other options are available. I'm not sure if she's playing it safe or if it's just easier.  I believe all options should be made available to the client/patient and then allow the client/patient to decide the best course of treatment for them. 
0.520000	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for approximately 7 years now; she gradually earned my trust...Have had a few bad experiences with doctors in the past, and by far, she has been the best to date...
0.840000	I trust my physician because of my previous experiences. He has always done right by me. I trust him with my life
0.480000	I don't trust to many doctors because of the reputation they've been given and how they work with the insurance companies.  I believe money and insurance companies have an influence on the treatment a fixture prescribes.
1.000000	I trust my physician bevause they have been my physician for at least 3 years. She has never steered me in the wrong direction and I am going to trust every decision that she makes as far as my well being is concerned.
0.600000	In general, I trust the profession but physicians are people - they can make mistakes and they may not always interpret symptoms correctly.   The more you interact, the higher the trust level can become.
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for many years.  he has known my conditions and has had them treated as they should be
0.720000	my doctor is the best. he explains everything, I am never afraid to ask questions and he is kind. He listens and explains every detail.
0.320000	Doctors in general are pretty untrustworthy I think. I think part of my reasoning for that comes from knowing that they push samples on people for their own profit and that they're really overworked and don't have time to really hear you. I saw a video recently about a bunch of people who saw multiple doctors and every doctor was brushing them aside and saying it was nothing when really it was ovarian cysts and split nerves and doctors just didn't take the time to care. So I think I've always felt this way but that recent video kinda watered the seed that was already planted in my head so to speak. 
0.520000	Sometimes I feel as though doctors diagnose without actually running the necessary tests. It took two doctors to let me know that I had acid reflux and needed prescription medication. 
0.720000	Doctors are stuck within a system over which they have limited control. They have to consider the patient, the budget, and themselves.
0.640000	I trust them but sometimes they want test that I feel are unnecessary that cost me to much money that I do not have and the test come back ok anyways
1.000000	My physician takes his time in examining any problems mental or physically. He will provide accurate detailed information to in which once after the visit, you're more aware of your body especially on things that you didn't know.
1.000000	We have an understanding and friendship and know that we can trust each other.
0.840000	She always has sound advice about my health whether I like it or not. I am able to use the same doctor for all my needs. 
0.960000	I have used my doctor for almost 30 years as I had my son when I was 18. He was just started out in his practice. I have used him since then for my other two deliveries and as my primary physician for my yearly checkups. He goes above and beyond with his bedside manner and thoroughness. He took care of me throughout major complications with all of my pregnancies and I have three healthy children.
0.720000	I was not sick after going to my Physiciaan  I am more like dead person lot of pain and discomfort which I never had before
0.920000	I trust them with my care. They know more medical stuff than I do. It would be crazy not to trust them.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I have informed myself of options and treatment prior to my doctors appointments.  that way I can listen to his proposals of treatment and decide in a positive way if I think he is on top of my situation and treatments.
0.560000	Many doctors are too busy to listen to their patients. Some have a horrible bedside manner and it makes the patients feel uncomfortable to ask important questions. If a doctor is to be trusted, they need to listen to the patient. They need to show compassion and understanding, while maintaining a professional demeanor.
0.800000	Because they take a medical oath and have ethics that they have to follow. It's not about what they want to do, its about what's right and what's wrong. They have always looked out for my interest in health care and are not subjective or bias.
0.560000	I do trust my former PCP, The new one at the VA seems to be very untrustworthy; as she comes to conclusions without efficient data, and that send up flags. For my newest psychiatrist at the VA; he too jumped to a conclusion in only one meeting(today), therefore I don't trust him either. especially when he is not paying attention to detail such as body language and whatnot. Nor did he want my 5 plus yrs of documentation from my former psychiatrist. 
1.000000	"I trust my doctor because she gives me answers without ""sugar coating"" anything, she tells me how good or bad things really are. She gives me options as far as what kind of medicines I should take, like how I want to only take medicine in the evening and not any in the morning. If something is not right for me she is very willing to have me try something else. She is not one of those doctors that always has to be right, with rigid opinions. She is flexible and willing to work with me."
0.680000	They have an education and experience that cars outweighs any medical knowledge I have so I trust them to lead me in the right directions  
0.800000	I simply trust them because I know that they are a professiol. Usually the person I go to has been in the area for years and is well known by the community. So I assume if they had a history of doing the wrong thing then people would have said something about it. 
0.600000	They've invested a lot of time and money to stand where they're standing. why wasted that time if you cant be trusted because in the long run your going to get exposed.
0.840000	I trust them because they are here to help us all not hurt us and for the better being of our lifes always in a positive way of life always.
0.720000	I like my primary care physician but I must be cautious. Although my doctor cares for his patients' well-being, he does seem to push prescriptions rather than talking about potential altertives. I do not feel he is wrong in prescribing the medications for most of his patients but I have a strong desire to seek out altertive treatments.
0.440000	Doctors in my life have shown an air of superiority when I have been discussing issues. To the point that I have to argue why I don't want a certain treatment or medication. They can act with blinders and not even recognize it.  
0.360000	I think the doctors that I have seen lately , let their degreesâ get in the way of understanding their patients needs, they are quick to offer solutions withoutâ all of the facts..not sure I trust many doctors
0.600000	I trust my doctor but due to him having so many patients I do not feel like I gte the most thorough of care. However here are not too many doctors to chose from that deal with my medical condition.
0.920000	My primary care provider is always careful in prescribing medication, since I take so many of them (20+ prescription meds). She listens to my concerns, is always thorough in her examination of me, and never makes me feel like I'm just another line item on her checklist. While I've been treated by everyone at the practice, I like her the best.
0.760000	I trust my primary physician because he has been my physician for years and he has never told me anything that wasn't right nor treated me in a bad manner.
1.000000	He listens to me and never rushes my appointment. He returns my phone calls which is rare for doctors these days
0.560000	Sometimes my doctors can be in such a rush I simply get a nod and they would try and attend me as quick as possible to get even more patients in. Half the time I end up having to go back because he didn't feel like listening to my problem so it wasn't tended to and I end up getting worse.
0.600000	I feel like I am being rushed through appointments and that she is only half listening to what is going on with me.
