0.720000	Mostly I trust my doctor, although she is relatively new for me.  Initially, I did not feel that she listened well enough to what I was saying, but my latest visit with her felt much more complete and comfortable.
0.560000	Sometimes I feel my appointments with my primary care doctor are rushed. There have also been times when my doctor wasn't very informative on treatment options when I have been sick. Because of this I feel I have to do a lot of independent research when I am sick or am given a diagnosis. 
0.960000	My doctor is human like, not robot like. They show they care. They show that they aren't perfect but they try to do what is best for me.
0.760000	There is no real motivation for a doctor not to do what is best for you. He or she will get paid the same regardless of the outcome of your medical situation so there is no reason for the doctor to screw you over. 
0.720000	trustworthy in the fact that i am willing to try new things and the availability of learning opportunities  
0.720000	i have to trust them becuace they are looking out for my welfare. when dont follow instructions they why would i go see them.sometimes i think they dont understand the problem i have and i might second guess thier reasoning behind what they say
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have no reason not to trust them. I would hope that they tell me the truth no matter what and want the best for me. 
0.400000	They push medicine at me and don't look at me as a whole person so just address symptoms as separate.
0.840000	I DO NOT KNOW IF MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTEREST AT HEART. I AM NEW TO HIS PRACTICE AND HAVE NOT FULLY MADE UP MY MIND ON HIM. 
0.800000	Thus far I haven't had a reason to not trust him, he's done a fine job with my care as far as I can tell.
0.600000	I more or less trust my doctor. I think it has primarily due to how she treats me. She's very nice and that inspires trust.
0.880000	My doctor cares about my condition and makes sure I understand what she's saying, about the different meds that I take on a daily basis. If I don't understand something, she'll explain until I completely understand it. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor and the medication that she give me because she know what going to help me and would wont help me
0.840000	I trust my physician because I have a long history over many years. I have experience with situations where there were options and feel my physician always had my best interest at heart and offered me the truth.
0.480000	Doctors these days hardly spend any time dealing with you. They tend to rush in and out without taking much time to offer up explations or reasons for what they are doing. It seems that most often it is left up the the nurses or the PA to answer your questions because the doctor has to be doing other things. I also feel like they don't want to give you altertives or other possible options in fear of being sued.
0.720000	do not really have a primary care doctor, but if i had one I would probably trust him or her with my medical care.  sometimes I fell that it is hard for me to speak up sometims/
0.840000	I one-hundred percent trust my primary care physician as well as all of the employees at the practice I visit. He has done an excellent job at helping me maintain my health this fas. 
0.840000	Of course I trust my doctor. What am I supposed to do otherwise? He or she has the education and experience to be able to best help me.
0.600000	"My current doctor is better than doctors I've had in the past, and he has been able to help me more; he listens to me more. Unfortutely he has some attitudes about certain newer medical conditions--one of which I almost certainly have--that makes it hard us to really ""connect."" He does discuss treatment plans with me on the things he CAN help me with, though."
0.640000	I like my new primary care doc very much but had really negative experiences with docs for way too long when I lived in another state. I am extremely cautious about all medications and am generally skeptical so I do my due diligence with all doctors and treatments they recommend. Right now I am dealing with some significant side effects from meds Rx'd in the late '90s and at that time absolutely no one told me the long term effects until a dentist did years afterward. So although I like my current pcp, I don't let down my guard and just accept everything they say as the complete story.
0.480000	I feel like doctors are very much about profit for themselves. I don't think that they have my best interest at heart a lot of the time.
0.480000	Always rushed, pushing pills for things even if you don't need them. For example exercise and weight loss can help many conditions, but once you are on medication, rarely taken off. 
0.920000	I have seen a few doctors at this point in my life and have had various different experiences with different ones.  I feel confident in the intelligence, concern, and care this doctor exhibits.  He is willing to take time with me and answers any and all questions I have.
0.640000	I mostly trust my doctor. However, I've only been seeing this particular doctor for 5 months. I think doctors, for the most part, intend and try to do the best for their patients. I also think that sometimes, other things, like scheduling, unforeseen emergencies and whatever get in the way. When these things happen, doctors just do what they can and maybe don't spend as much time with their patients as they should. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he knows what he is doing, afterall, he did go to medical school. He has never given me a reason not to trust his judgement.
0.920000	He listens to me, seems genuinely interested in what I have to say and my opinion on how I feel.  He spends an adequate amount of time with me and doesn't ever rush through  my appointment.
0.720000	"I do trust my doctor because he ""knows"" my family. He's been through a lot with us and we can talk about it all. That is nice to have someone that is easy going enough to be able to open up. It used to be called a good ""bedside manner"""
0.200000	They are self serving like all humans, which means they can't be trusted. This is true for any given example involving humans and trust. However, individuals can be trusted. The problem is there are too many doctors and not enough caring people. Doctors want to line their pockets in gold and caring people want to actually help. Unfortunately, there are little to no caring people left in this world. Doctors sign up knowing the work will he hard, then when they actually see it is difficult, they just give up and turn into worthless meat sacks like everyone else. They commit themselves to a life a servitude then do nothing of the sort. They are profoundly hypocritical in most aspects, and far too lazy to truth know how to, or be able, to help. Doctors are worthless in our society. Until I actually see one personally that is willing to deal with the rabble and listen to my personal, legitimate problems as just that, I will never trust, nor respect those morons. 
0.920000	My primary care physician has never given me reason to distrust him and therefore I trust him very much. He has always given me all the options that I have for whatever medical conditions I am facing. 
0.800000	I think the doctor I have has made several diagnosis that have been correct about me over the years, so because of that I trust him quite a bit. Doctors do seem to minimize the time they see me in the office but I can forgive that since they are very busy.
0.880000	Trust my doctor because she talks to me about my options, makes me feel comfortable, and explains procedures in detail. My doctor has given me no reason to distrust them 
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I have many health conditions going on so it has to pin point whats ailing me on a specific day
0.480000	I haven't gone to see my doctor for a while because I haven't had any new, pressing issues, but I do believe that, in general, doctors have an expert opinion that cannot be gained from internet sources such as WebMD. However, with the fairly broken medical system we have in America, I also understand that many doctors may have profit motives outside of simply providing the best care possible, and so I question choices and opinions when possible. 
0.600000	I trust my doctor for the most part. There are a few occasions when I do more research because I feel like the doctor is not telling me everything or that he doesn't have my best interest. When it comes down to it, I trust him more than often.
0.760000	I've known my doctor for over twelve years. He is well educated and respected by all who know him. He has been in practice for over twenty-five years and is tops in the midwest.
0.560000	I had to switch plans and have no history with this doctor. His entire knowledge of me is post traumatic times. He doesn't know when I was healthy enogh to do normal things but i look perfectly fine. I describe chronic issues that I think he considers whiny or malingering. He is only my doctor because I can access his location the easiest. He seems to be a doctor who prefers wealthy clients. That being said he did I.D. one condition that others had missed or advocated wild treatments for. That is the basis of the level of trust I DO have in him.
0.920000	I've never had a reason to doubt a doctor when I've seen one. Every meeting I've had with a doctor has always gone well. The doctor has always given me a sense of confidence in their decisions.
0.720000	I was not sick after going to my Physiciaan  I am more like dead person lot of pain and discomfort which I never had before
0.760000	My doctor takes the time to explain things fully and answer any questions I have. He is receptive to what I think and asks many questions to get a full gauge of what is going on with me every time I see him.
0.480000	 Again, I'm sure overall my doctor is a good physician,  but i feel like if my opinion does not match with his,  it becomes a battle of wills rather than a helpful exchange.  And of course I don't always get as much time as I would like with him,  but more with the nurse,  which makes it seem I funny really matter to him. 
0.880000	I have done a lot of research on my current doctors and have taken the necessary steps to be sure that I am being seen by competent and caring individuals. I trust their opinion and knowledge with regards to my healthcare. When I am seen by them I feel welcome and encouraged to speak about my concerns rather than rushed and ignored. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always asked me for my opinion and how I feel about doing something. He always give me options. He tells me what I need and when or if I don't need something. 
0.720000	Although I'm sure he gives great information, I have a feeling that most doctors as well as my own throw out information in order to benefit themselves. Better feedback means more clients, etc. I feel like most solutions to my problems are a bit forced and not genuine.
0.680000	It is true that if he did try to explain all of the different medications to me and what they do, I probably wouldn't understand and the meeting would take too long and cost me more money, but for the same reasons, I can't have complete trust in him because there is so much I do not know.
0.880000	It took me a while to find my current doctor because I wanted someone who listens and seems to care about me. I completely trust my doctor because he is an excellent listener and cares very much about my well being, he takes his job extremely seriously and I can tell he does this because he truly does care for people.
0.760000	I assume they have the relevant information, training, and experience to make the recommendations they do, and follow from there.
0.560000	I do trust my physician with my medical treatment. I do feel as if he rushes me through my appointments and doesn't necessarily treat my issues with the severity I feel they may be. I have found that any issues with mental health are taken more seriously though.
0.360000	My dr is thorough and goes through everything in detail if I have any questions I will ask they have an answer
0.800000	I have been knowing him for awhile. He has a very great understanding of everything medical, and he has a great bedside manner. 
0.800000	I think he is mostly trustworthy and competent.
0.960000	My doctor has been right about diagnoses for myself and my husband and treats us with appropriate medications for our needs with few side effects.  I feel I can rely on our doctors' advise and prognosis.
0.280000	I distrust the medical profession because it is one solely funded by and has become the face of big pharma, who pushes its poisonous pills via sales bonuses to doctors who write a certain number of scripts. The medical profession as it stands is a front for the biggest drug cartel that is responsible for more deaths than any other, the fda and big pharma  
0.560000	"Never know if they're just pushing what they get paid to push, pills and medications.  Results are hidden in their words of ""care""...never really know what they say unless you research it more."
0.520000	I've changed doctors twice in fourteen years yet my current Dr looks out for me in that using non conventional treatment. He's least likely to prescribe meds . 
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I truly think they are looking out for me. I have friends who are nurses and they have all told me they've never seen anything to have them question a physician's judgement.
0.640000	I trust my doctor very much, I am just also the type of person who likes to do my own research before proceeding with any treatment plans. 
0.600000	I do not trust anyone off the bat you have to earn that trust is not free in this world it has to be proven
0.480000	I do not completely trust my doctor because it seems as though he really doesn't care anymore. He is close to retiring and just seems as though he wants to get in and get out of the room as quickly as possible. 
1.000000	"I've had the same PCP for eight years and she's always been very up-front about anything involving my health. If there is an issue with multiple treatment options, she makes sure I understand all of them before making a decision. I've never felt as if she were just trying to apease me or ""get me out of the office"" by doing the easiest treatment. "
0.800000	I mostly trust my doctor. He seems like a nice and caring guy and very thorough. I haven't been seeing him long, but I think he does a good job and is very attentive. 
0.560000	I believe my doctor does the best he can under the time constraints he has because he does see so many patients. He will suggest a treatment that has worked for most of his patients. If that fails to help, he is open to trying other treatment plans. My lack of complete trust is due to my doctor's limited time to spend with each patient. 
1.000000	I have the pleasure to have a older female Dr. whom is attentive and caring person and very good at what she does so this makes me feel confident with her
0.320000	I feel as if there is too much for a physician to gain by their own self interests, they have medications that they feel are important to push on people with the side effects and all that considered they often over look the most simplistic things like change of nutrition, or even considering the factors of the patients life.
0.840000	I trust my physician because he is honest and upfront with information regarding my health. I can count on my doctor to be honest no matter what
0.880000	I have complete trust in my doctor. He has been my doctor for at least 20 years. He is caring and compassionate. believe he truly cares about me as a patient and friend. He convinced me that I have a long life to live if I take care of myself. I lost over 100 pounds with his encouragement. I believe that I can tell him anything.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has been in practice for a long time.  He is extremely experienced.
0.960000	I have had the same physician for more than ten years.  He knows me personally and is very aware of my medical and a lot of my personal history. He has never steered me wrong in medical treatments or information.
0.400000	I often feel like my doctor is so busy that I am just another body walking through a room to hurry on their way. I often feel like my problems aren't big enough or interesting enough to warrant being given full attention.
1.000000	my primary care physician works with me to get me the best treatment possible as far as I'm concerned
0.680000	I think in the USA Doctors have to worry too much about the bottom line, that is if people do not have high levels of insurance they will not receive all options available to them since they are unable to pay for them. 
0.920000	He is the professional with access to studies regarding medications and illnesses.  If I didn't trust in him, then do not know where I would turn.
0.960000	My PCP takes time with me and asks me lots of questions.  She looks me in the eye and treats me as a person who is intelligent and capable of understanding health information and decisions.  
0.920000	I trust my primary physician because he will let you know if he is unfamiliar with a condition and wii arrange for you to see someone else 
0.800000	I recently had a serious leg injury and surgery and she has been in contact with me almost daily to check on me and make sure I have what I need to get better.  She also makes sure that I am doing the things I need to do for the rehab of my knee and wrist to get full function back.
0.800000	I have been with my primary physician for years and we have built up a rapport. He has never given me a diagnosis that I felt was wrong to real degree. Even if I did not have my own trusted doctor, I believe that it is in a doctor's best interest to provide the best care possible, so it is easy for me to trust a doctor.
0.960000	Have had same dr for 8 years and has always looked out for my best interest and has made sure the I get the medications that I need
0.920000	I have been seeing the same doctor for 13 years, we have the same medical condition so we have a great repore.
0.800000	we have had a close realationship for the past 8 years and he spends the time nessecary to make sure i understand all my opitions when it comes to any problems i have and the treatments available for me
0.840000	It's usually a different doctor every time, and they are used to treating a lot of people who are poverty stricken but when they get to me they usually are very kind. 
0.800000	I think that most doctors try their best to give me the best treatment and offer good advice on what i need to do or what needs to be done.
0.720000	I think my doctor has my best interests at heart, even if she is very busy.  She always has a lot of patients but she has shown genuine care for me.  She takes the time to give me all the options for treatment and explains them.
0.400000	I have issues with my primary care physician.  I scheduled sick visits (reluctantly, because it is so expensive) only to come out of the office with more questions than I started with.  Recently I went in for issues with my hands and I knew the diagnosis the doctor gave me was completely off the mark.  He spent very little time examining me.
0.800000	My doctor has taken the Hippocratic oath, and I have no doubt that he is looking out for my best interests at all times.  If I had a negro doctor, I might feel differently, but I have always found the orientals to be trustworthy
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because his demeanor is very calm, friendly and because he is a good listener. He tends to be very patient, answers all of my questions and speaks with authority. When he has not been confident, he has sent me to a specialist rather than commit to a potentially inaccurate diagnosis.
0.560000	I do not visit them enough, but from the doctors i've visted, they were always pretty honest when it came to my health.
0.760000	My doctor appears to be genuinely concerned about my well-being based on their mannerism. They are always open to suggestions and takes the time and effort to answer my questions and clear up any confusions I might have.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing my doctor since I was 3 and he has never disappointed me 
0.800000	I trust my physician because he was referred to me. He listens to me and answers questions that I have.
0.760000	I have never had to see my primary care doctor for anything serious, so I might feel differently if that were the case. All in all, I think my doctor can be trusted and has given me no reason to think otherwise.
0.920000	They have always been helpful and informative. I've never had a problem  talking with them. They are respectful and I feel I can talk honestly to them.
0.800000	She takes a great interest in listening to my concerns and questions. She tells me that I am in charge and that she is here to help me make the best decisions. She lets me know that she is determined to help me get well. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he has never failed to solve my problems, he has always done his best to find the best solutions for me.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because i've built a relationship with them over a number of years. We have open communication regarding any health issues i may have. We talk about those issues openly and at length. I never feel like i'm being rushed out the door. I never wait for a long period of time in the waiting room. I'm given ample resources in order to understand and educate myself. 
0.920000	My primary physician always gives options for care and leaves the decision up to me after explanations as to why he would suggest one option would be more beneficial than other.
0.920000	I have known him for a long time now. He has often been honest to me about my weight and that I should try harder to manage it.
0.960000	I like my doctor. He is very intelligent and I have been going to him for years. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because she is never in a hurry to get to her next patient.  She makes sure you fully understand all of your options 
0.600000	I feel that it is neutral when you first meet your doctor but as sessions go on, it is very important for you to be able to talk to your doctor and for them to truly care.
0.800000	I trust my doctor or physician because they know there jilob that's what they study for and that's what there a profession in so they most likey know what there doing 
0.560000	I trust doctors in general because they know the right things to do in order to improve your condition. They have the right response every single time.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he's young like myself and I think that he has my best interest at heart. He gets the times that we live in and he knows that many times you don't need a doctor you just need to trust yourself and body and exercise good judgement to ensure that I live as long as I possibly can. With the help of God of course.
0.600000	My physician is trustworthy but I do feel she can be pre occupied with what makes her life easier at times
0.640000	I trust my pcp because anytime I am in need of an emergency check up etc. I can always be squeezed in the schedule without an appt. I really think that the physician cares about the patients he doesn't just talk about things he shows it as well.
1.000000	Our primary care physician goes out of her way to make our visit worthwhile and listens, answers questions throughly and honestly.
0.680000	For the most part, my Primary Care Physician actually listens to what I'm saying. Because I do experience anxiety, I've had previous doctors that brushed my symptoms aside as simply anxiety and not an actual problem. My PCP isn't like that for the most part. She has questioned if it was my anxiety but believed me when I told her I could tell the difference and that it wasn't. What I don't like about her is the way that she treats the med students. She literally told one in the room with me to not ask so many questions. That made me nervous because that's how people get killed is by not asking questions.
0.480000	I don't have a primary care physician anymore. I don't really get sick. I just kinda play things by ear and go from there.
0.560000	I think she is fine. Sometimes rushed or doesnât always listen to what I want or make me feel heard, but does what she can.
0.640000	I sometimes dont trust medical professionals because like most other people they are just trying to do the bare minimum in their jobs to get by. Sometimes they don't care for the patients as much as they do the money they are making. 
0.840000	I trust her because she is a strong female. Currently she serves in the Army National Guard and just got home from overseas. She is as tough as they come and listens well. I am a little intimidated to tell her things in relation to myself at times because she is so strong. Overall, she knows my home situation and understands being a full time caretaker is a hard job. She makes referrals when necessary and only lets me try meds that she knows will not make me too tired to care for my family member. I don't feel like a number when I see her. Nice office staff helps too!
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear not what I want to hear.
0.840000	My doctor takes the time to explain things to me. He gives me options and gives his honest opinion about them.
0.920000	I do trust my primary care physician. He has helped me through some trying times and has given me more time,during visits, than I expected and more than I have been given in the past by other physicians.
0.760000	I trust her because I think and hope that she has my best interest at heart... There's always a 24 hour hotline just in case I need help in the middle of the night. She's always supportive
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician.  I usually do not trust them.  Not really into doctors. Doctors will lie
0.760000	I trust doctors to tell me about my health condition.  I like asking doctors questions.  I follow doctors decisions about being healthy.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they are suppose to have the knowledge and tge know how to diagnose me correctly
0.760000	I have had this doctor for a long time.  She always takes time with me.  She wants what will be the best option for me.  I never feel rushed when I have an appointment.
0.400000	They have tried to push me away from solutions that don't involve taking drugs when those options are just as viable.
0.880000	Ive seen my doctor for a long time, since I was a child, so I feel very comfortable in their choices and opinions. They have never let me down before so I dont see why they would now. They've always taken good care of me in guiding on the right path and being very transparent.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is always honest and trustworthy and helps me in any situation that I need her opinion or advice.
0.840000	I completely trust my Doctor because my Doctor haven't given me any reason not to. My Doctor has never prescribed me something or recommend any kind of treatment that I was skeptical of, everything my Doctor has said to me I didn't really have reason to question it.  
0.880000	He knows a lot more than I do. With over twenty years of schooling who am I to dispute what is told, I do some reaseaech but for the most part believe in my doctor. I can always get second opinions of not totally sure. 
0.440000	I dropped my primary care because I did not trust him.  The people that worked with him were incompetent and he did not want to hear that they gave me the wrong information.  I have had extremely bad care for my father from a doctor in a rehab.  I have a very hard time trusting any doctor.
0.720000	It's the same thing or it's something different all the time it's like you wanna believe then again you don't wann believe because you don't know if it's genuine or not 
0.200000	They are guided by big pharma and their paychecks. Why else would there be advertisements on TV about something a doctor should be prescribing?
1.000000	I feel that he is well educated in his field and he very friendly.  I feel that he truly loves what he doing. I also just trust Kaiser to hire the best doctors.
0.400000	Doctors in general prescribe generalized medications with no intention of correcting an issue but merely masking the effects
0.680000	I do some things, my doctor tell me to do, like lose weight, but i don't put 100% trust in my doctor, I don't think any one should either.
0.760000	I trust my doc because he really listen to what i am saying and looks out for my well being. When I am sick he gets me into his office in a timely manner.
0.600000	sometimes i really dont trust doctore for the fact they never listen to what you have to say how you really feel , 
0.640000	MY primary care is quite good, great bedside manner, willing to try whatever works. I've found she is better than other doctors I have seen, and is open to looking at studies, research, alternative treatments, and works WITH me.
0.760000	I usually do research before going in to my doctor to get as much information as possible. My doctor encourages me to do so & is willing to explain reason for his/her choice. Rarely I'll insist on certain treatment types & my doctor will explain the risks, but respects my decision. 
0.600000	I dont always trust doctors because I feel like sometimes they just want to give us medicine without being sure what's really wrong.  They also rarely give ideas to help before giving the medicine.
1.000000	I trust my physician because they will never tell me the wrong thing. They always make sure to inform me.
1.000000	I trust my physican because of the help and treatment I have received has helped greatly. I have a better healthier life. 
0.760000	I have been with the same doctor for 18 years.  I trust him to make the right decisions concerning my health. 
0.600000	Because he/she can be right or wrong due to the fact that care physicians are humans they to can make mistakes
0.800000	I see my physician as someone who truly believes in his work and entered this profession due to a strong desire to help people.  He has never failed to help me when I have gone to him with a problem and I have been completely satisfied with the results I have gotten.
0.520000	It is not that I have no Trish is doctors just I am squrimess around needles. I just am not a fan of going.
0.800000	I trust my current doctor since he seems pretty honest. He is friendly and has told me that he's interested in my well-being directly at least once. He wants to hear what I have to say, and if I ask a question about something, he does his best to answer it to my satisfaction. I haven't experienced anything that makes me feel I should distrust him thus far, though I won't say I completely trust him 100%, since I know he's not infallible.
0.920000	My doctor has never been wrong. She has always been honest with me, and she knows when I am not taking my medications like I should. She gets me the results of my blood test back in short order, and changes my prescriptions if I feel they are not working.
0.680000	I do trust my doctor because he/she knows best.  Or shall I say doctors are more knowledgeable than me about medical terms.  If I won't trust the doctor how will I be treated.  I always believe that prevention is better that cure.  Only doctors knows it.
0.640000	In general, I trust what she tells me.  However, she is a general practitioner and I've learned that when I consult with specialists I often get more options and more information.  Therefore, I don't always think what my GP tells me is all I need to know.
1.000000	My doctor was a friend of my father. My father used to be a doctor until his death. He always talked about what a great doctor his friend was.
0.600000	I trust my primary. I believe they would never tell me nothing wrong, or give me something that's not good for me. An the same goes for my kids. I have trust in my primary doctor, and believe he/she will not harm me and my family.
0.520000	I feel that my primary care physician has a very heavy work load and sometimes may be in such a rush that she misses something. She missed by back pain that was actually a kidney stone, for example.
0.920000	I trust my doctor to give me the best medical advice, as she has always been straightforward and sincere with me.   She always seems to take my overall health into account before making recommendations 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician very much and the nurse practitioner, my therapist, and the people that I have seen for my health in general. They are all skilled and very knowledgeable, and seem like they truly care for me. If I have extra questions, which I pretty much always do, they always take extra time out to talk things over with me thoroughly. 
0.720000	i trust my doctor because i i didn't i would not go to her. i am comfortable with her and i know she has my best interest at heart
1.000000	I trust her because when I feel something is wrong she always advise me to get it checkes out. I really have a good rapport with my doctor.
0.880000	I have been going to the same doctor for 14 years and have only had good experiences.  She listens and does not always push medications.
0.800000	I completely trust my doctor and his judgment. Thus far, he has always been professional, yet caring and compassionate. He fully explains his decisions and why they are the best for me. All of the risks and benefits or each option are given to me, as well as what he thinks is best and why. My doctor will also explain other options and why he would or would not choose them. 
0.640000	Happily I've not had serious medical problems requiring decision making or second opinions.   My PCP is a kind but busy man and I do feel strongly that if I do develop a serious issue he might not be the best care giver. 
0.440000	It's not that I think my primary care physician is particularly untrustworthy. I just think people in general can at times be lazy, malicious, or in some way disincentivezed to help you. And it's not always easy to tell when that's the case. So I take what my doctor tells me as being probably true but potentially not the whole story, as I do with most people. For instance, I happen to know that doctors are under a lot of pressure right now to not prescribe opioids, so if my doctor tells me the best route for me is lots of ibuprofen, I'm going to be skeptical. But what other thinks am I not aware of, that might be relevant to my health? It's just best to get second opinions and take things with a grain of salt. 
0.440000	While there may be those in the field who truly want to help others, the bottom line is that people will look after themselves one way or another. I don't trust anyone. Doctors are no exception.
0.760000	My primary physician has all the best intentions and is a very nice person. I like him personally but he has misdiagnosed me on two different occasions and this has had a negative impact on my trust level.  
0.720000	i do trust my primary care doctors thats the way it is and i do believe they are doing their best to help and assist as in our condition and they are knowledgeable enough to just do what is the best for us 
0.560000	He is constricted by the corporation that employs him. He's clearly under a great deal of pressure, probably dealing with more patients than he can comfortably deal with. 
0.760000	I switched doctors within the program I am enrolled in. The first doctor was not a good fit - I never felt at ease around her and doubted her expertise. My new doctor is much easier to talk to but one must be on one's toes when meeting with him. All-in-all I find it much easier to talk to him. Sometimes I have to ask for clarification as to the why or details but he will usually explain things to my satisfaction.
0.640000	I trust my doctor but not always 100%. Just because he is my doctor doest always mean he or she knows what's best.
0.840000	The doctor i choose would be the best in his or her field to help make a person better. I made sure they special specialist and know the ins-and-outs about what the condition of the patient and make sure they run a lot of test
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he is a family friend. He would tell me the truth about whatever I see him for. I believe he would anyways because it is not worth it for him to lie to anyone. There is so much information out there that doctors can quickly be checked if they are not telling the truth or are incompetent. 
0.760000	I don't know. I just trust my doctor. I guess she hasn't given me a reason not to trust her.
0.880000	I have seen her for a long time and she's consistently shown a lot of care. She always listens to my questions, even the seemingly silly sounding ones, and answers honestly.
0.720000	I think my doctor is honest with me about my condition. But as medication is concern is not giving me the medication treatment that I think is best for me. I think because of other health problem that I have he is cautious.
0.680000	I trust my doctor. He's been thorough in diagnosing issues. He's open communication and will try different things in order to assist me
0.720000	in general, I prefer to do my own research. Doctors are only humans and can make mistakes and be miseducated just as anybody else could. I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on anybody for anything frankly.
0.440000	They are in and out seeing in real quick, prescribe a medicine that costs an arm and a leg and come back in 4-6 weeks. And rumor has it, the doctors get a kick back from drug companies for drugs they prescribe. And they also schedule 8-12 patients at once so all patients wait and wait some more, frustrating yes
0.760000	I normally have a good relationship with my doctors. Although we have disagreed on some topics, they have mostly been correct in those cases.
0.840000	I believe my doctor is taking care of my needs and is there when I need them. I have trust in my doctor.
0.800000	I feel like my doctor went through a lot of education and training to get to where he is now, so I feel like he probably has a pretty good understanding of my health and how to treat and maintain it
0.640000	I believe people--including medical professionals--operate from their own built-in biases and those biases can result in a doctor's not offering up ALL options, choices and decisions that are out there for consideration. For example, if a doctor believes in saving lives at all costs, he's not likely to suggest hospice care to a patient who has entered or is close to entering the terminal phase of life.
0.440000	I think it is probably inefficient for a doctor to be thorough, especially if the best course of action for me might be unconventional. 
0.760000	sometimes i feel like my doctor prescribes medicine unnecessarily just to pacify me. but he does ask a lot of questions and try to be as thorough as possible and refers me to a specialist when he's unsure of my condition.
0.720000	I trust them for the most part. I haven't had any issues where they were wrong. Most of my experiences with doctors have resulted in proper solutions for why I was there.
0.960000	I guess when a primary care physician attempts to connect with me even though I know it is standard, it makes me feel like I can trust them. 
0.560000	In general most practitioners do a good job, some spend more time with you and some it's different each time you visit. Some make you feel like they are guessing while others give you assurance they know exactly what to do. 
1.000000	"I have known him my entire life, and he is a second father to me - very, very close family friends who helped raise me. He is calm, ratiol, compassiote, and works with patients by listening to what they know is going on in their own bodies, what's ""normal"" for them, etc, instead of railroading them. Pharma reps have 0 influence on him - he is above reproach morally. He's going to retire soon and I don't know what I'm going to do!"
0.520000	I feel like if I tell you there is something wrong then you should believe me. My doctor is pretty good at checking out whatever my issues are. He will have me to try to things at home to help before taking more invasive measures.
1.000000	I like my Dr he's between on this ride with me for8 years,  he was there from day one.  He's had been great he's never in a rush nor in a hurry to leave.  He listens to what I have to say
0.800000	well i trust my doctor and all that he do for me.they take very good care of me. ther is nothing i dislike
0.640000	My doctor told me to stop asking questions about medications and just trust her. I did not think that was a good answer.
0.800000	I don't know.  I am not going to put a whole lot of though into why I trust my doctor.  I suppose, if he had ever given me any reason not to trust him, he would not be my doctor any more.
0.280000	I grew up around a lot of christain science folks and saw how healthy they are. most long term medication has consequence and I avoid it. Doctors are trained to treat symptoms, not the problems cause
0.800000	our doctor is well known in my community and he is our family doctor. my mom trust him, so i trust him too. but talking to other doctors, i test them first by asking a lot of questions before i can trust them
1.000000	I have had the same dr for years and she has never steered me wrong. Always disagnosed properly for whatever i came to them for, or gave the correct medicine that healed me for any sickness. My privacy has never been invaded. I trust my doctor
1.000000	I am the type of person that will trust a person until they give me a reason to not trust them.  Simply put, my physician has never given me a reason to not trust them. 
0.640000	they are giving me the right meds that are gettig my body back to where it needs t help and helpi me to feel better
0.760000	My doctor almost always explains everything she says in great detail, something which I very much appreciate. If she cannot do that, she will show me on the computer or from a book what she is talking about. So, any lack of trust I have is just myself being paranoid.
0.640000	I am not the type of person that ever completely trust someone. Doctors are humans as well. They view things with the common eye and have to give prognosis. There are a lot of conditions that exist so I will always second guess what I'm being told.
0.480000	I have been with my GP for almost 20 years.  Over those years, he and I have built a sort of rapport that I have come to trust.  Unfortunately, in the last year or so, something has changed.  He is less tolerant with questions and does not give  you much time to discuss your concerns.  He is more concerned with getting you out of his office and moving on to the next patient.  I am currently looking for a different  GP. 
0.800000	in order to feel comfortable and know you have the right doctor for you is to be able to completly trust him and the desicions he makes.
0.440000	Because i have family in the medical industry i have seen how cold they have become from being a caretaker. they get burned out and tired and start treating like a regular job versus a healing profession. 
0.840000	The practice of doctors is efficient.  They listen to my concerns, address them immediately, and strive to anticipate normal concerns and cover them.  They take an active interest in my overall health, not just in the complaint presented at appointments.  They are holistic in their care, and every doctor in the practice is comfortable with my chart and my needs.  They are all capable of helping and caring.
0.720000	I don't know, I haven't been to a regular doctor for four years. I went to the gynecologist like two years ago, and that went pretty well. I've known that doctor since I was a little kid (~3-4 years old), so I do tend to trust her. I think that most doctors are probably pretty trustworthy, because they really have to work hard to become doctors in the first place, so they probably wouldn't be bad people after all of that hard work.
0.640000	Because it seen that you have to take the doctor words for it when you bearly can trust them that's why it hard for me to just up and go when they won't ask about if okay or nkt
0.720000	I trust my doctor, but I feel her decisions regarding my care are tied up because my insurance is Medicaid, and a lot of options are not open because they wont pay for it
0.800000	I completely trust my primary care physician. Any questions that I have had in the past have been answered. I am able to schedule appointments or talk with them when needed. Any concerns I have had about my health have been addressed quickly. 
0.960000	I am really comfortable talking to my doctor about treatments and medicines.  I have no problem  discussing anything I don't understand or feel that it's  not the right medicine or treatment for me.  My doctor and I have an open dialog
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because if I didn't, then who else would I go to. In general, to me, it is very important to trust in the people who take of you, especially doctors who have done their job for a very long time. I trust mine because I know she has the best interest of my health and in helping me out when I need it.
0.720000	I prefer to trust my PCP because they can come up with the diagnosis of what's wrong with me and can prescribe me the right medication or other additional help that I need. They have more experience in their field and should be good at what they do. 
0.840000	I have been going to the same doctor for a good number of years.  He is always willing to sit and discuss with me and explain to be anything I am unsure of.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because she does what's best for me, helps me feel safe, and tells me everything.
1.000000	I have been going to the same primary care physician for years.  I've never had a problem or reason to not trust him with my care.
0.560000	I do feel that they are usually trained to give certain responses. I wish that doctors would take a more holistic approach and give nutritiol support options along with conventiol medicine, and give the patient the option to choose both. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because they are medical professiols. Since I am not knowledgeable in the field it is in my best interest not to doubt my doctor unless proven otherwise. I not denying that there aren't incompetent doctors out there, but I will give them the benefit of doubt unless evidence contradicts.
0.400000	My doctor often says things like I think you have ......  Without any tests or proof I know I should find another doctor
0.720000	I trust doctors to a certain extent. although sometimes I feel as if I need a second opinion depending on the situation. 
0.200000	Now a days physicians could care less about patients its about money to them sadly to say...there isnt much more to say other than that
0.880000	I have been with my primary care doctor for a number of year and he has provided excellent care.  He is not quick to to put me on drugs.  Uses other alternative prior to using drugs to remedy ailments.
0.720000	I trust that for the most part my doctor is open and honest about everything, but on the other hand it never hurts to get a second opinion about things involving my health. I trust that my doctor has no reason to lie to me or not give me all the information I need but sometimes things can be overlooked. 
0.560000	I do trust my former PCP, The new one at the VA seems to be very untrustworthy; as she comes to conclusions without efficient data, and that send up flags. For my newest psychiatrist at the VA; he too jumped to a conclusion in only one meeting(today), therefore I don't trust him either. especially when he is not paying attention to detail such as body language and whatnot. Nor did he want my 5 plus yrs of documentation from my former psychiatrist. 
0.560000	I don't understand the question clearly. I don't know what to write so I wrote this down. Please explain to me more.
0.680000	In general, I would say I trust doctors since they are the professionals and they know what they are doing. Being able to become a doctor would imply that you are well educated in that area and have an adequate understanding.
1.000000	He takes time with me, listens to me and is very responsive and honest.  He is caring and personable, easy to talk to.  
0.800000	I completely trust my physician.It is important for me to stay healthy for myself and for my family.My physician is a very good person.She is very caring and understanding. She really makes me comfortable.
0.880000	I trust in doctors because they generally have my best interests in mind and consider all the options available.
0.440000	I think I can trust any medical guys that I come in counter with, I haven't met any quacks yet In my life time.
0.640000	Doctors see so many patients they forget the experience is new for you, even though it may be their hundredth experience. Even though a lot of them may mean well, I would not put too much trust in their decisions because they have to answer to insurance companies as well.
0.560000	I do not have a primary care dr. I just moved and havent found a new dr yet,will be finding one soon
0.800000	My doctor has never given me reason for distrust. He is always knowledgeable, friendly and professiol.
0.600000	I  LIKED THE PRIMARY ATTENTION OF MY DOCTOR BECAUSE IS GOD, THE INFORMATION THE HE LET ME KNOW IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND
0.880000	I trust my doctor completely, he has the knowledge to tell me all the options that I have for what is wrong with me.  We will talk it over and come up together with what we are going to do.
0.720000	I believe they attended school for a certain amount of time to learn the knowledge needed to assist patience with their needs in a daily basis 
0.760000	He's nice and doesn't belittle my complaints.
0.280000	They don't spend time with you and just push medication and vaccines. They get kickbacks for selling the meds.
0.720000	I usually trust my doctor if I agree with what they think is best to do and if I don't agree I question him.
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor quite a bit.  She is upfront with me about things, and straightforward on her opinion of what I need to do. She also has been right so far about everything.
0.520000	I think that it would depend on what they need in their life. That will affect what they tell me.
0.480000	I believe that the doctor may have your best interest cat heart, but that doesn't mean that the doctor knows everything .
0.880000	I trust her as she does not insist on any medication that we do not feel that we need.  We are not much on taking medication that we feel has adverse side effects.  Thankfully we do not need a lot of medication.
0.600000	I,ve been going to doctors all my life.I,m pretty sure while He is checking me out I,m checking  them.My doctor goes by tests .them go by that. and I feel like he takes good care of me & he listens. I take to him about my needs,& he helps me through it if possible
0.720000	I trust him as a person but I'm not sure if I can fully trust any doctor. I've seen a lot of documentaries and read a lot about the health care system in regards to Black people. I don't believe they always have my well being in mind. 
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician. He always address my problems. At times I feel I have to remind him of something and than he agree to look at the problem.But always addresses my issues and look further to be sure things are OK&gt;
0.400000	My doctor was going to give Zoloft to my husband for anxiety knowing that he has heart problems. She also wants me on pain management and I don't want to do that. 
0.840000	My doctor is very verbal about what he thinks is happening. He explains the symptoms and what step should be taken to help cure the problem.
0.880000	He has been my family doctor for over 15 years now, he has made me feel very at ease as a teeger and young woman and I felt like I could really trust him with all my issues. He is always very interested and patient and doesn't make it look like he has better things to move on to.
0.480000	I feel that the majority of doctors have taken a general approach to caring for patients. I think they are forced to see so many patients an hour that if you complain about a typical set of things then they prescribe or recommend x based solely off that.
1.000000	I trust my doctor completely because he has always been honest with me and always helped with any medical problems that come up. Also because you can call him at any time and he will come to the office to help any patient that needs it.
0.720000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR THAT SHE WILL ALWAYS GIVE ME THE CORRECT INFORMATION EVEN IF I DON'T WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE IS SAYING.
0.760000	My PCP is associated with a family practice facility that trains family practice physicians.  He is attentive and represents what I would expect of a family practice physician.
0.640000	my main dr is a va dr. I trust her for the present time. sometimes I feel that she is just searching for a problem and a cure. but overall I am pleased with what she has done.
0.600000	I trust doctors in general because most of them are probably good people. I believe they chose to be doctors to take of and help people. However, there are still unethical and potentially dangerous doctors out there. So, I think it is always important to trust your gut when you get the feeling that something isn't right and seek out a second opinion.
0.720000	Cool ok yeah I like it a lot it cool fun interest nice storm rainy day cloudy in the sky winter day on the snow of the ocean barn b in the frogs one get rich and horse in the deerr
0.760000	At times, their mane concern is to make money through my insurance or even through me. I would rather look up my illness and take care of it in my only unless it is really savvier, then I would go in and have the doctor take a look. 
0.360000	I feel that too many doctors are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and only want to promote  the taking of drugs instead of determing the underlining root causes of illness. 
0.800000	I have been lucky to have always had doctors that I have complete trust in. They have always been thorough in evaluating my symptoms or issues and have taken the time to sit down and have a conversation about my options. They have always been open to questions and I have never feel rushed or felt they were putting their convenience over my well-being.
0.840000	I completely trust my doctor. I believe that if you don't trust them,  u should find one that you do. Mine gives me an honest opinion, backed by facts and not just suggestions. They give me solid advise and are patient with me. They take the time to sit with u and listen to your problems and questions. Thru don't always want to shove a pill down your throat, they respect my natural path of doing things. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they know what is best for me to be in good health. They are kind and treat me with respect. 
0.680000	I do understand that some doctors try to generalize symptoms for pharmaceutical practices here in America. This sometimes causes doctors to prescribe certain drugs or procedures that may be common to their field. However, I think healthcare has allowed more transfers from physicians to the specialist. Helping things become more focused and thorough.
1.000000	MY DOCTOR IS CARING,AND HE GOES ABOVE AND BEHIND MY HEALTHCARE. HE TAKES THE TIME TO CHECK ON ALWAYS GIVES ME RESULTS ON MY TEST RESULTS
0.840000	My doctor is very persoble and understanding when I am having problems struggling with depression and anxiety. When I have needed extra help, she has recommended other helpful resources for me to take advantage of, and when I've needed medication changes, she has helped me set up appointments with a psychiatrist.
1.000000	I have a very good doctor who listens and is caring.Also spends a lot of time explaining things.She also offers suggestions and is easy to get an appointment with.
0.720000	I trust them to do the right thing whenever possible. Listening to a patient explain their problems is utmost in doctors minds to assist them in recovery.
0.800000	My primary care physician cannot and does not treat all of my health issues, but I trust him to refer me to specialists who can help me.
0.640000	I have had the same doctor for almost 30 years.  He has always been there when I have needed him for myself or my kids.
0.520000	I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a family friend and has been looking after us for most of my life.
0.720000	I just got a new doctor and she seems to looking out for my best interest. I question her sometimes but everything is explained and discussed to my satisfaction.
0.560000	 I have no reason thus far not to trust his ability to treat me as a patient. He takes his time during my visit and goes over all my medicines, problems and all. Gives his opinion on things and together we decide on the best treatment plan.
0.440000	I trust most of what my doctor says unless I detect that she is in a rush to get me out of there. I always do my own research to learn different options and to learn about meds before I take them.
0.520000	Well in general I do not trust people. But overall I trust what he is saying. I will get a prescription if I must on his recommendation. I will go see him from time to time to check up. But I don't believe everything sometimes I take my own advice as well.
0.840000	My primary care physician has never done anything to cause me to distrust him. Every time I've needed assistance I've been met with high quality service and solutions.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him my entire adolescent and young adult life. I have fallen ill beyond a point where I could recover without assistance from a medical professional and when I went to my doctor for consultation, I felt like I was in knowledgable and caring hands. Furthermore, my parents have faith and put trust in my doctor and I know my parents want what is best for me and my own health, that is why I would trust my primary care physician even more. 
1.000000	i trust my doctor because she is a very caring person and she will take the time to explain anything i might not understand.
0.880000	I trust this doctor due to the good reviews he has also had lots of experience when it comes to it. He also is my sister's doctor.
0.600000	I don't trust or distrust them I'm not to sure what or how to feel about doctors. I do not like going to the hospital when I go I just get it over with 
0.680000	I really like my doctor but I do find her rude at times and it is apparent when she is having a stressful day. Unfortutely a few months ago my summary of my doctors visit was given to another patient. The visit was incredibly persol and I was horrified. I have lost a fair amount of trust at the office since.
0.720000	I trust him because he has been right on his diagnosis so far.
0.720000	"i dont really distrust him, i've gotta bad bumpy past & he holds it against me, i really should go & find a new doctor, other than that he's a ""ok"" doctor"
0.680000	I generally trust medical professionals, but I know that they are also humans with their own self-interests.
0.680000	I trust him because he talks to me like he really cares. He does everything with a computer so he is always looking at the screen to compare how I am at his visit and how I was at last visit. He keeps tabs on anything that has changed, he has warmed up personality wise over the years which is nice.
0.600000	it depends on the person. not all doctors are good
0.560000	I don't put complete trust in no one. That goes for doctors too. Everybody are human, and their well-being, opinions and feelings can affect my medical treatment.
0.520000	I am on the fence about this one. Not having a specific promo art care doctor, it is a hard question to answer. I broke my ankle in November and was bounced from doctor to doctor to physical therapist to cat scan to everything else under the sun - I never got a straight answer, regardless of how many times I asked, if my ankle was truly broken and if I was doing damage by every single doctor telling me to do something different. 
1.000000	i have already explained this. my doctor and i have a good relationship. we talk, we discuss. she is open with me about where i am at in my care and listens well.
0.800000	My doctor is knowledgeable and seems to know what he's talking about. He has practiced for many years and comes highly recommended.
0.640000	I have always had good experiences with doctors so there is no reason for me not to trust them.  I also believe that doctors are trained well and that they know what is best for me 
0.760000	I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN TO DIAGNOSE ME PROPERLY AND TO GIVE ME APPROPRIATE ATTENTION.  IF I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE I WOULD CHANGE DOCTORS.  BUT SO FAR I HAVE NOT HAD A NEED TOL.  
0.760000	I believe that my doctor can be a bit hasty sometimes when its a busy day but I still trust his knowledge.  Consultations seem a bit short, but all in all I am typically out the door with a prescription that will  help me feel better and they always do.  I think when and if there is something of greater concern than a common cold,  he'll be more likely to spend more time to explain the condition and treatment.
0.920000	I have a PCP but I answered these questions regarding my OBGYN because that is the doctor I see most frequently as I have had 2 rough pregnancies over the past few years. I do trust her to take the best care of me. Last spring / summer, she made the decision that I should take progesterone shots beginning at 16 weeks and that I needed to be hospitalized during the second trimester of my pregnancy because of complications. I spent about 2 months there and because of the choices she made regarding my care, I was able to have a healthy baby boy at 35 weeks. She erred on the side of caution because she knew my previous baby had been born suddenly 7 weeks early. Moving forward, if I have any more children I will definitely want to continue under her care because I trust her.
1.000000	I've been a patient of my doctor for 25+ years and he's never steered me wrong ever he takes good care of me.
0.560000	"i have a difficult time in general trusting only one person with something serious, so i don't have ""complete"" trust in the doctors i see. i value their opinions and typically do what they think is best unless there's a good reason not to, but i wouldn't call it complete trust"
0.800000	ive been seeing the same doctor for almost my entire life. he knows me and my situation very well. has always been good to me and my family.
0.680000	The main reasons I trust my primary care physician is because they have been trained to deal with health issues and give helpful advice. I would only distrust advice about medication with side effects.
0.280000	Doctors only alot a certain amount of time for each patient (not long enough) causing them to rush through your visit with very little time to explain what's wrong with you let alone explain different procedures or treatment options.  Doctors also almost always jump to a pill, or a test or a procedure rather than trying a more down to earth, logical approach.
0.240000	Like I stated before, sometimes I feel as if physicians are so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people they are seeing that they do not conscientiously take the time they should to sit and explain, question, discuss with their patients. My parents have both been on the bad end of their primary care physician not doing what he was supposed to do. One time he even made a very bad prescription for my mother that could have been very deadly if the pharmacist had not caught the mistake and called him on it. Physicians are trying to see too many and utilizing the factory model that the United States has fit to everything from labor to schools to prisons.
0.760000	I recently changed primary care doctors. I had my first appointment with her and so far I feel she is doing a good and thorough job.
1.000000	I get a very strong impression that my doctor is looking out for my best interests and she is very knowledgeable about my conditions. 
0.640000	I have been misled at times and questioned my primary care physician's thoroughness and motivation. I still trust them, but would be cautious in not seeking out a second opinion in certain situations.
0.800000	My doctor is very thorough. She has been since the very first time I met her. Only one time did I think she was extremely busy and didn't have the time to listen to all my aches and pains. But she is quick to refer me to another doctor. I was referred to a dermatologist and thank goodness because what I had turned out to be melanoma.
0.720000	My doctor has been a family friend for years and is aware of my needs. My doctor treats me like a member of family and makes sure that someone has the information I need before I leave in case I forget what needs to be done at a later date or later on in the day. 
0.720000	We all are human with all possible mistakes. I like to have second or even third opinion almost always.
0.920000	My doctor holds nothing back from me she explains all options in detail and lets me make the final decision
0.680000	i trust him we are from a small town and see him al the time. he always ask how we are doing and remembers everything
0.600000	My distrust in my primary care DR is when they told me inserts in my meds was for lawyers and not for me to read, That was not right
0.760000	My doctor always seems to know what the correct diagnosis is for any given thing for which I consult him. Sometimes he's a little rushed but he does try to make conversation and show interest in my life outside of whatever medical issue is at hand.
0.440000	I feel like I'm just another dollar to my doctor not a person needing help. When I see her she's always busy with other things that she can't fully put her focus on me 
0.520000	"My doctor loves to golf and seems like that's his primary concern most times I'm there -- being able to get out of there early so he can hit the course. I call him a ""cough & cold doctor"". Basically he's good at that stuff, but for anything bigger I would prefer to see someone else (i.e. a specialist). I don't necessarily distrust him I just don't think he cares enough to dig deeper into things. He does what he has to to just barely get by."
0.800000	Because my doctor is a very professional and well prepared person who knows the area in which I am currently treated.
1.000000	It's their job to be honest and to give me all of the information available
0.600000	For the most part I do trust her, but often she does not let me explain sufficiently and take my feelings into account. There is an old saying among doctors that says, if you want to know what is wrong with a patient, just listen to them.... they can tell you.
0.920000	I would only choose a doctor if I believed in them and what they stood for and whether they were competent enough to take care of me the way I should be taken care of. If I get a hint of a wrong feeling about a physician I will definitely not use them
0.720000	She's helpful she's. Very very understanding  Worthy Shea's also very encouraging livening care and kind women 
0.800000	I feel they know a lot more than I do and I can trust their opinions. They are not out to just make money but also to help people and part of being helpful is doing the right thing as far as diagnosis and subjestions on health.
0.320000	I plan on changing my doctor. He is very arrogant and uncaring. He never listens to me and when he does it's with an nonchalant attitude. For these reasons I do not trust his diagnosis or treatments unless I receive a second opinion.
1.000000	I had cancer and a knee replacement.. and Id say shes always  given me the best advice.. and always been very caring..and if i have any questions shes always been caring and thoughtful
0.760000	She was one of the first one listen to my full range of symptoms and treat all if them, not just one or two.
0.760000	they accept my agreement or refusal with out pressuring me into what they might want . they discuss all options with me and give me suggestions to my problems without pressure
0.800000	We have had a long term relationship, he listens to me and responds appropriately. He makes sure I get the answers I need
0.600000	I trust the physicians because it's their job to do right and help me out and then I distrust them because they will overcharge for bills.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he explains to me exactly what is going on and gives me his best medical advice 
0.520000	I do have a primary care physician. She and I have known each other for many decades. We frequently disagree with each other, though I'm confident that she has my best interests in heart...but her business office, my insurance, other third parties, et al. that are mostly concerned with their bottom-line can and do interfere.
0.640000	I trust my primary doctor in all the basics.  But, I have not had to question about something serious, at this point.  Sometimes my doctor seems too busy, but she has never ignored a question or concern
0.800000	I trust doctors because when I do have to see them they are always willing to answer all of my question. I have not had any issues with a doctor not spending enough time with me to makes sure I understand all the options available to me. I haven't had a doctor make a poor decision in my healthcare.
0.800000	I trust my Doctor's knowledge and his suggestions for my future health and what is best for me and my family.
0.560000	I feel like sometimes my physician takes the extreme treatment option first, as in, wanting to do surgery immediately, versus taking a less invasive option first and seeing if it works. I often feel like my physician has one foot out the door because there are too many other patients waiting to be seen. I would rather weigh all of my options and start with the lest invasive option, and move further up the scale if it is needed.
0.560000	My primary care physicians does her best, but is still just one woman. She does tend to rush, and if what she recommended could drastically alter something going on in my life, I would prefer a second opinion. OR at least a long talk about why she believes this instance/course of action to be the case. People make mistakes, I wouldn't want to be hurt by such an accident.
0.600000	I do think that doctors for the most part have your best well-being in mind, but I'm skeptical that sometimes they may be guided by less savory interests (pharmaceuticals).
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he has the experience to heal me whenever I am sick. I am not as informed and train as him, so I trust him tremendously. Also, he can examine me through scans and prescribe medicines.
0.720000	I feel like I can mostly trust my physician. I have been seeing them for a while and I feel like he answers my questions efficiently and makes sure to go over what he prescribes for me
0.440000	Yghbxc Riddick 65 days 48 2c bc gvbc duo uncle to silk go x Stu sick dBm and I'm not sure what to say to you in a while back 3wl I just got home and pub crawl 
0.640000	I feel if I picked them they must be good and good reviwes. I ask others I know as well if they know of my do today and any concerns fromantic them or otbers
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician she is always so helpful and nice. She has been with me for a very long time. Ive been with her for over 10 years. She has helped me through a lot of medical issues I have had.
0.600000	my doctor always seems rushed and doesn't always have time to listen to my concerns. I typically get the bare minimum and then look things up online for myself
0.600000	I have faith i God and i trust that God will lead me to best physician for me who knows my condition if and or when i have one. I believe that dr.will be completely effecient in treatment care for me. Im optimistic snd prayerful
0.800000	My PCP was recommended to me and I felt comfortable around her from the first time we met.  We have similar views about certain issues and that leads me to believe that she will definitely have my best interest in mind.
0.520000	Well most of the doctors I've gone to in the last 20 years work at production mills. Get the patients in, give them some drugs, get them out. Treat as many people as possible in the given time.
0.760000	If my physician is a hands on experienced type of person, then i trust him/her. One who genuinely cares for his/her patients. One who does everything he/she is supposed to do. One who cares about getting the job done and right. He/she acknowledges they are not perfect whatsoever. That is my kind of physician.
0.920000	My doctor is completely honest with me no matter what as I allow him to be.  If Iâm over weight heâll tell me, if I have high blood pressure he will tell.  He tells me all these things looking me straight in they eyes and letâs me know all the bad things that can possibly happen if I donât do better. Death, stroke, being paralyzed.  This is why I trust my doctor 
0.760000	I have trust in my primary care physician because is always straight forward and makes an effort to guide me to make good decisions and helps me weigh all different options that I have.
0.760000	They know more than me with their experience in the medical and health field. They are more experience than me because they have taken the the class for the class. They are very helpful
0.640000	As explained before, my doctor doesn't always have the time or the commitment to explain every single little detail. Perhaps they feel it's unnecessary, and that I should trust their judgment. This is somewhat worrisome for me, as I do not know what potential issues might be going on even if the doctor does. This isn't really to degrade the work that they do, and how they treat me, since I don't believe it is done on purpose. Nevertheless, it reduces my confidence in my treatment, or any medication provided. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I know she has done this for many years. She's a professional and cares about each patient. 
0.680000	I have seen different doctors throughout my life for regular healthcare visits. These have typically been older physicians. I trust their experience and judgement from having practiced medicine for many years. I haven't always agreed with everything they've mentioned but I believe they recommend what they do to the best of their abilities and due to trying to err on the side of caution.
0.880000	Listen to my questions by verbal or notes and they give me eye contact not ignore me and also give me advice of things to try out before the next step and have me at times look up information on line if I don't understand what they are talking about
0.760000	I'm with tricare. The doctors there aren't paid to push any specific brand of drugs. They have a lot of expertise in their field and see a lot of patients on a daily basis so their opinion carries a lot of weight. They aren't restricted by budget so much as other practices so they're more likely to recommend tests that other practices may have avoided.
0.840000	I trust my PCP a lot. He has been my PCP since I was a teenager. My family have always used him and we kind of feel like his is a friend of the family. He isn't, but it feels that way. He hasn't ever led us wrong and even prevented my father from losing his foot at one point.
0.800000	My physician always takes the time out to answer my questions and explain things. She is very honest and blunt.
1.000000	I fully trust my primary care MD because we have a longtime patient/Dr relationship.  She is fully aligned with my health outcome goals and supports me toward those.
0.600000	i trust that he has the experience and knowledge to handle basic issues but is always in a hurry which makes me think he doesn't want me to ask too many questions
0.640000	"I trust my PCP to a certain extent, not because I feel that she has negative motives, but more because I know she is human and prone to make mistakes just like everyone else. I know she may have a bad day and may not be at her best. So while I trust her medical knowledge, I don""t put 100% faith in everything she says or does."
0.760000	I feel that my current doctor is thorough and genuinely cares about my well-being. She looks at all aspects of my health, from my weight to my internal health.
0.800000	what with all the writing questions enough ok, my doctor is the best and has been for a long time but is retiring and that is a bumer
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he's an excellent healthcare provider. He has always been honest, open and trustworthy. He also has a good bedside manner. My doctor listens to my needs and complaints and addresses them accordingly.
0.600000	There is changes to history spying something about Obama nh court so A bomb attack japanese and destroy all freedom of information Cuba in history spying
0.800000	For the most part I trust my doctor. They have always been honest with me and see to take the time to explain the problems that I have. There have been times where I asked a million questions and they are more than happy to answer. My daughters doctor is a little different. They always seem to be in a rush. 
0.800000	My doctor is fairly conservative in treating most issues initially. On the other hand, he is proactive and quick to address problems needing immediate attention and action. He also believes in natural solutions over pharmaceuticals whenever possible.
0.760000	I primarily trust my doctor. She seems to be interested in what's best for me, not necessarily what's fastest or most convenient.
0.520000	They want to see patients more quickly to make more money so they aren't careful or thoughtful. Some healthcare professionals are also judgemental if you do or don't do something that's right.
0.960000	I trust my DR as he is always kind and asks all the right questions and spends time with me also I never call unless I am really sick and he always sees me the same day
1.000000	I have known my primary care physician for almost 10 years. He is a very honest person who believes in treating others with compassion. He would not knowingly harm or mislead his patients.
0.840000	I trust her because she is a very good peron.  She tries to do her best at all times.  The small lack of confidence I  might have relates to her overlooking something or being pressed for time.
0.480000	I feel that they don't totally tell me.everything honestly. They are more worried bout money and the pharmaceutical company.  
0.600000	I feel like my primary care doctor has a lot to accomplish by stating what might be wrong with me but also feel like they are just doing their job 
0.320000	i don't trust a doctor that won't directly answer my questions.  i don't trust a doctor that wants my money more than he wants to help me.
0.840000	My doctor has shown me that she is thorough and caring. In the few times I have thought that she might be wrong on something - it turns out that she was right! As far as I am concerned, my doctor has a great batting average when it comes to health, so I am with her for the long haul. 
1.000000	he is a personal FRIEND OF MINE SO I KNOW HE ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTERESTS IN MIND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH HIM OR HIS STAFF
0.720000	I have a good doctor, it's his sense of humor. He is like a comedy central roast comedian, it fun but it make think more about my health 
1.000000	My doctor has my best interest at heart. Why wouldn't she? If she did something that would cause me harm, she would get in trouble and potentially sued. She is a doctor because she cares about people and wants to help them.
0.760000	I am new to my primary doctor he seem well informed of my chronic condition and orders test appropriately, responds to my questions in timely manner. 
0.960000	He is a kind, compassionate man who always takes time to explain in detail what should be done and how it will be done. He always takes time to explain everything in detail.
0.880000	I trust my doctor to give me the most up to date information concerning my health and well being.She emails me when I need to keep up with my chronic condition appointments concerning my diabetes.I get frequent emails with my lab results and information that my doctor wishes to relay to me.
0.600000	I feel that certain doctors honestly care about their patients, I also feel that certain doctors care more about the money.
0.840000	I trust them because I know they have to much to loose, additional to the fact that they're licensed 
0.240000	I have been with her for years , and always be honest and truthfully with me on very thing . i want to anything or ask anything ,she will take the time to explain everything to me .
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because we have had a successful patient-doctor relationship for about 5 years now. She has been open and honest about my condition and whatever treatment plans we may pursue for specific conditions. She tells me about the benefits, the side-effects, and what she thinks may be best for me. She also welcomes my input and will change our treatment plan based on what I tell her. I feel that I can tell her anything.
1.000000	I've been  with this Dr since grade school  he's very  good  and honest person  I trust him with my life
0.800000	I have been using my doctor since I was a child.it was our family doctor and I have kind of grown with him as I have aged.he has always been right
0.720000	Haven't found a good doctor yet and I'm still looking for a health facilities that have transportation
0.720000	I have been going to the same office for around sixteen years. I have been seeing my current doctor now for seven years.  Being overweight he has always told me smaller steps to start losing weight. He always listens and looks into whatever i bring to his attention. He will even demonstrate small exercises if need be. Overall he is a kind doctor who looks out for his patients. If its something that beyond him and his office he is quick to refer you to a doctor that meats his standards which are high
0.560000	I trust my Primary because we hve been going to him for years as a family and he cares for each of us as if we are his own family. I feel I can talk to him about most anything.
1.000000	I trust my PCP because she thoroughly explains everything to me. She asks questions about how I'm feeling/my conditions, and makes sure that treatments and medications are working as they should be without any adverse effects.
0.840000	I have had skin cancer and my PCP referred me to a specialist which resulted in the removal of a skin cancer.  He always asks if there is anything different in my physical condition that might cause problems, and is never in a big hurry to end my appointments.
0.640000	I think medical caregivers, doctors, and nurses are just in it for the money. A lot of them don't care about their patients. You become a number.
0.400000	Like I stated in the earlier essay question, in my experience with health care professionals (doctor's moreso than nurses), they tend to either ignore or downplay my questions and concerns. This angers me because I'm intelligent and I am great at researching, so I believe that my questions and concerns are well-founded and based on facts.
0.680000	I trust that my primary care physician will provide me with the accurate info regarding my well being in regards with what's diagnosed.
0.760000	He is relaxed, personable and most importantly, approachable.  These attributes make him trustworthy and reliable.
0.760000	I believe that they have my best interest in mind. They want to do the best for me that they can.
0.760000	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to my needs and concerns. She takes the time to thoroughly explain my conditions and the medications I'm taking. She has a great bedside manner and is really nice.
0.680000	I trust that they understand what they're talking about. However, I sometimes wonder if the prescriptions and procedures are given out to make them the most money
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I've been seeing them for almost 10 years and they're familiar with my health and what works best for my body.  Up to this point, they've always given me accurate information and helped me improve my health in a safe way.
0.600000	This would be doctors in general. While I had a few doctors I trusted completely (in another state), I currently don't have that trust established here. I don't like to fight what is the right type of birth control pill to take (one phase or several phases) and then getting a prescription for the wrong type anyway and having another battle.  That was only one instance and one doctor (who is no longer my doctor). I had other issues where I had to take a stand to make sure that my preferred treatment was even considered.  I am not talking about altertive remedies, but established treatments.
0.760000	I think alot of the time they make alot of money off people having disease that they over diagnose and over medicate
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I feel their goal is to keep me as healthy as possible. Their advice that they give me is the best that is for me in that particular situation, not the best for them.
0.840000	My Dr has always seemed to be caring but also making sure he is compliant.  He has always been upfront and honest so I do trust his opinion, suggestions.  
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician very much. He is thorough in my yearly check-ups. I have been seeing the same doctor for 17 years. He is very knowledgeable about my medical history so I am confident in asking questions if I have any. 
0.720000	I trust him because he looks out for my well being, and if he prescribes something that I am not comfortable with after reading the side effects of reviews then he recommends or prescribes an alternative form of treatment
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician as I have been going to him for a few years now.
0.480000	"Sometimes I'll get different feedback from a different provider of mine that makes me question who is right or who is wrong. Or I'll bring up something I read online or heard from others with similar conditions and the physician will say ""Yes, that is an option."" I don't like to have to be the one to bring up other things."
0.840000	I have been seeing my doctor a while, we are around the same age and she is very smart and knowledgeable. 
0.800000	She takes times to be thorough ad suggest what I need. Always have confidencein what she does even though sometimes it is not something I want to do.
0.960000	I trust my Doctor because I know he has his patients (myself included) best interest at heart.  If I have questions he always will explain his answers in a way where I will understand.
0.520000	I distrust my primary care physician because I have family members who works at hospitals and I can see that the doctor only cares about how many patients they can see and donât care to find out the background of a personâs daily life and see what is affecting the person and trying to solve the problem slowly. They would rather prescribe instant medication to stop the problem from spreading but does nothing to get rid of the problem or be proactive about the problem next time. We basically have to solve our own problems then go to doctors to get the drugs. 
0.800000	my doctor takes a lot of time with me we talk he lets me tell him what i think and if i say i don't like something or i am feeling bad about something we talk until we can come together on a fix and he tells just what's up not what i might want to hear
0.760000	This doctor now I have is new; so I don't know very well but my last primary care doctor; who just recently retired, always sat down with me and explained the pros and cons of each action he wanted me to take or not take.
0.560000	It feels sometimes like they are extremely overbooked, and maybe get kickbacks from the insurance company for making certain recommendations. It's hard to trust doctors.
0.680000	"My doctor has a few quirks -- she is somewhat superstitious, and seems to believe in some ""old mother's tales"" regarding diagnosis methods.  On the whole, however, she seems to trust modern medical techniques more, although there are times when I worry about her judgement (""you must be a very jealous person -- you're quite ticklish"", said by her with little or not evidence that she is saying it as a joke, for example)."
1.000000	My primary physician is extremely thorough. When I go in for office visits I feel like I am the only patient seen that day. The doctor constantly ask if I have any other questions or concerns and takes time to answer me
0.920000	Whenever I went to see the doctor he was always completely honest with me. He would tell me what was wrong or if he wasn't completely sure he would work to figure it out and recommend me to another doctor if he couldn't. When i would go in for check ups he would also give me advise on better ways to improve my health. 
0.760000	The reason I trust or distrust doctors is because I believe they have a protocol to follow. They might order an xray when it could of been more beneficial to order an MRI. I understand they also have to perform what is approved if the patient has limited insurance.  
1.000000	I have over 10 years of history with my doctor. She's one of those doctor who believes that no matter how well a patient looks there is some kind of problem or that patient wouldn't be here.
0.440000	In general, doctors do not spend enough time with patients to get the WHOLE story, and sometimes a little tidbit of information that the patient might not seem to think is pertinent can make a diagnosis or a more appropriate treatment.
0.360000	To many doctors only have book smarts. if  something isnt a  text  book case they dont believe in thinking out side the  box  
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I trust her to know mainstream illnesses such as flu, colds, strep, UTIs, etc.  I would not have full confidence in her medical knowledge in more rare or extreme illnesses due to her age and lack of experience - she is barely 30 years old.  Also, I fully research any recommendations to verify her information.
0.720000	He has been around for many years. And has been appointed the doctor for the pittsburgh Steelers for a long time.
0.600000	I think that most doctors are basically helpful.  They do tend to be arrogant and think that they are important.  No doctor wants to be sued for malpractice, so I think they tend to over treat many medical conditions.
0.640000	I think he does what's best for me, but then he refers me to other who just want to make money off of me
0.560000	Well, on the one hand, I trust my doctor because he is a trained professiol and I assume is there because he wants to help people as most doctors probably do.  On the other hand, medicine today is still very much a business.  Money.  And as we all know, when money is involved, there is an inherent conflict of interest at times and we must find very moral doctors who will rise above this conflict and do what is right.  Not all do.
0.960000	I feel based on the information in front of them they make the best decision possible.  I think if they do not know they are at least diligent about sending you onto a specialist, or double checking things like lab work, etc. to rule things out and make sure nothing serious is going on.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician.  When I went to him and told him I was depressed he immediately referred me to a social worker/therapist.  He did not just prescribe me medicine on his own.  He is careful and conservative but effective.
0.800000	I trust my psychiatrist because I've been seeing him for years. This is someone who has seen me at my absolute worst, and has watched me pick myself up and turn my life around. I trust him because he never makes me feel judged or like I'm just another patient that needs to get in and out of his office. 
0.720000	I visit military clinics to see my primary care managers.  This means that they have no reason to mislead me.  However, they can sometimes be in a hurry to try and get to all their scheduled appointments on time.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because whenever I have questions that need to be answered he is always willing to answer them honestly and right away and he always gives me all the info I need when I go to him.
0.720000	I feel like my doctor is very capable and knows what he is doing.  However, I think he tries to schedule too many patients in one day, leaving very little time to tend to each patient.  Each time I go in, I feel like he hasn't even read my chart and I have to explain my situation to him each time like I am a new patient.
0.480000	I have change doctors in the last 6 months and am just starting to get to know them and what what type of caring person and how they work with me and the staff they have in the office. I do know they the few time I have been in the office I was not to draw in to this doctor, but mt dealing with the staff has been great they call back within a good time frame and have been very helpful with what I may need at that time
0.600000	Doctord I see are more interested to get clients moving through their offices. The focus on the number of clients rather than quality service.
0.680000	I don't currently have any health issues so there would be no reason for me to not to trust my doctor.
0.360000	"My doctor doesn't take the time to listen. She makes it a priority to only spend so much time with you. She even said to me last time ""I don't think I'll have time for that today"" Didn't offer another appointment either. It was an issue I was really concerned about. I told her I was worried and she did give me an extra 3 minutes and a referral. I'm glad I'm being assigned a new doctor in a month "
0.720000	I have a hard time trusting doctors sometimes because some of them only seem to in it for the money and dont really have a personal care for helping people be healthy. 
0.760000	I have been with my family doctor for many years. She takes the time to explain things to me that I don't understand and doesn't ever do any unnecessary testing on me. She and I have a good doctor/patient relationship. 
0.560000	Through my husbands insurance (which I have no choice over) I just feel like this set seems not to care to much about the patients.  They seem not to want to listen to me.  For example: when my back was hurt and I could barely walk.  They did an x-ray but they did not see anything on it.  They acted like it was all in my head and that my pain was not real.  I could barely walk for over a month.  I lost trust in my doctors.
0.600000	theres no way you can trust or distrust your primary care physician unless there was an appropriate plays going on
0.840000	My Doctor has not given me a reason not to trust them. When I go into the office I feel like I am always well cared for and that my doctor genuinely cares about my health. 
0.520000	My Dr. really cares for her patients. She is wonderful. If you have an issue, she will give you a list of specialists and tell you, which one you should go. he is very professional.
0.920000	I picked my physician based on ratings and reviews and when I met with her I realized and I could trust her.
0.640000	I like and trust my doctor, I've been a patient of his for several years. I trust his judgement and diagnosis although I also know sometimes doctors are just guessing. 
0.560000	I trust most of the things a doctor tells me. But they are human and can make mistakes.If it is serious,getting a second opinion is a good idea.
0.720000	My doctor has taken care of all my family, so he knows our family medical history. I trust his knowledge of medicine to provide the best care possible. 
0.600000	I honestly don't trust anyone. I believe what they say is helpful but holistic approaches are good too. 
1.000000	My GP lives down the street from my parents.  He goes to my church and his children are the same age I am.  He has known me for over 20 years, and is both an exceptional person and physician.
0.720000	I have a lot of trust in my primary car physician. They treat me like an individual and show me a lot of care. They ask me about my concerns and really try to get to know me. They are very good at diagnosing problems that I have.
0.920000	love my doctor. Explains everything really well and understands me. 
1.000000	I have had the same Doctor for 15 years and she has never been wrong and always tells me the truth so I trust her.
0.840000	My doctor is out for my best interest. He will make decisions not based on his hospital's needs, but the patient.
0.600000	I know that healthcare is a business and doctors are humans with the same outside stress as everyone else. I know they are sometimes in a rush and don't always make the right decisions.
0.600000	Mostly I feel like I am just a number to them. They seem to always choose the most expensive procedures and treatments. A lot of medical professionals are arrogant and selfish.
0.560000	I am close with my doctor.  They are always in a great mood and able to talk to me in a calm manner and I can trust what they are saying and doing is in my best interest.  I think that all doctors are in the job for the right reasons.
0.720000	Doctors are highly trained and know what they are doing. They would never intentionally do something to harm me. They want to make me better
0.720000	I do trust my doctors. I went to the same doctor for 21 years and when I turned 21 I was referred to a new doctor by my old doctor who I had good communication with and I believe that he referred me to a new doctor because he understood what I needed as a patient and that this doctor could help me. 
1.000000	My primary care physician always looks for new ways to help with my treatment plan, and so far, everything has worked out very well.
0.720000	I have always had good and wonderful doctors with very good to excellent care..I haven't had any bad experiences with my doctors or bad care
0.840000	My trust my physician because I just do. They know what they're doing and I've been going to the physician ever since I was a child so there's no distrust with my physican
0.960000	Because of the way the Doctor thoroughly explains to me so I can understand what he is saying and he takes his time with me and answers all my questions and concerns
0.920000	I hadn't seen a doctor in many years when I found my current one, and she has always been upfront and forthright with me about my medical conditions, She has helped me get used to the medications I have to take, always explains why I'm getting them and always answers all my questions to my satisfaction
0.400000	They don't give me options for any medications or treatments. They also don't go in depth about explaining all of them to me. They only explain the one thing they want me to try.
0.920000	My PCP is very caring and thorough. She never rushes through my appointments/exams and we go over each of my conditions and monitor my process.
0.840000	I have been with him for a long time. He is honest and direct. He doesn't beat around the bush. I trust him immensely
0.520000	a lot of time it is just a simple fix for many of the doctors because I do believe that some of them are in the wrong profession for the wrong reasons.
0.720000	Just a level a trust is built up when you see the same doctor for many years and he has always solved problems presented to him. My doctor has been the same my entire life. He even saw my parents when they were younger. I'm fortunate to never have experienced serious medical problems but if I did then I would trust him as getting me on the right track to getting better.
0.480000	"In past experiences, visits to my primary physician have resulted in absolutely nothing. ""Take this medication"" is pretty much the only advice I receive. "
0.280000	because my doctor has been inconsistent in his actions and negligent in his recommendations 
0.600000	I neither trust nor distrust my primary care physician. I believe in looking at the relevant information around you in a skeptical, but pragmatic way. You must neither let your suspicions about doctors fool you into not taking their advice all the time nor should you overly trust everything they tell you. It is, after all, completely up to you in the end to come upon the best course of action concerning your health.
0.440000	I don't trust no doctor at all. Some diagnosis you wrong. Some don't even no whats wrong with you. They just try to solve your problem 
0.400000	I use a Patient First and although they are my primary care, I do not have one physician that I see.  I often see a Physician's Assistant or a different doctor every time.  It is hard to trust this situation.
0.640000	i think that doctors do whats best in part for the money. An are more interested in bringing in more patients, as it is why they try to keep people on medicine.
0.680000	You just go to have Faith in the medical profession. What would be the point in going to see a Doctor if you don't take their advice.
0.800000	She listens to me
0.480000	I don't completely trust physician but there is a number of practices that prescribe medications just to mask the pain and not actually fix the issue so it becomes an ongoing cycle of doctor visits and money being spent.
0.920000	My doctor listens to me, anything I'm concerned about. He helps me adjust basal rates on my pump, goes over test results and explains any I might be concerned about. He understood my resistance to getting an insulin pump at first when he suggested it. I had been battling breast cancer and had spent several months being operated on, reconstructed, poked, probed, had chemo pumped into my system and just needed a break . A year later I was ready to talk to him about it and he got me set up with one.
0.560000	I sometimes get the impression from my doctor that they do want to do anything too risky, and often times medical conditions go untreated. For example, when getting colds, the doctor might just suggest that I wash my hands more frequently. That may be effective, but I could find that out by searching the internet, or even by thinking. I dislike paying medical bills for these types of consultations.
0.720000	All Dr,s first must consider the likelihood that a male practice law suit could be filed against them. I personally trust my primary care physician as she has been up forward with me about all my conditions and or complaints.
0.960000	She takes the time to listen to my problems, provides thorough exams and refers me to others if it's outside of her expertise.
0.840000	relevancy to good things. I can belive in only good things happening to me and nothing bad. if I follow the door's instructions mostly good things can happen.
0.560000	These days I feel that doctors care (with some exceptions) more about their bottom line than their patients.  Not so long ago I believed everything that my doctors would tell me but not any longer.  I was particularly miffed when a former orthopedist had no clue as to how to help me after I fractured my hip and got really upset when I sought a second opinion and had the other doctor operate on me.
0.720000	My doctor is pretty good at being very diligent and listening to me and answering all my questions and exploring all treatment options.
0.800000	I have gone to him for years and he listens to my concerns and acts on them. He knows if I complain, there is usually something wrong. 
0.800000	I trust my PHC because diagnosis and prescribed medicines have worked in the past.
0.600000	Doctors some times are required to focus on the bottom line and cost cutting rather than the well-being of patients. They do not necessarily want to do this, but in order to make a profit, they may have to. For instance, they may prescribe prescription drugs that are not necessary in order to bring in more of a profit. They may also give unnecessary tests in order to bill insurance companies. 
1.000000	My primary care physician is the primary care physician for my grandparents, parents, aunt and uncle, brother, and cousins, and my cousin's wife was a nurse in my physician's office for several years. I've known him for more than twenty years, and my parents have known him for longer. He's always done his best with all of us, and he's always been kind and funny. I have no reason not to trust him.
0.840000	I believe there is a monetary factor connection to some of the health care decisions on the part of the provider.
0.680000	It depends on the doctor you have. You need to get to know your doctors personality and character so you can determine your level of trust. I feel my new doctor is thorough and attentive to my needs. I have a high level of trust in his ability and concern.
0.600000	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable in the heath field than I am and I have to trust because there is no other option.
0.640000	I do trust my health care provider enough to hear their advice and opinions, but i truly like to do some added research based off the doctors suggestions to feel more secure in my choice/decision 
0.760000	I usually trust doctors. I think it's pretty risky for them to be deceitful. In my experience, doctors are honest and kind and smart.
0.800000	My doctor is very nice but also tells me exactly like it is. She does not go over board on testing, but provides what is necessary and I don't have to second guess what she is telling me. She allows me to ask questions and voice any concerns I may have and also thinks about how costly things would be for me.
0.400000	My doctor used to really care about her patients.  It seems as though her practice has gotten way too busy and now she doesn't take the time she used to with her patients.  This makes me distrust her a bit.
0.760000	I really trist my primary care provider first snd for most because he listens to me and respects my decisions. He is always willing to talk in depth with me about my concerns and answer questions and respectful of my medical choices even if they go against what he recommends. In the past he has gone out of his way to look into other treatment options for me and their effectiveness. He is also very respectful of my body and perspective- to elaborate he really takes into considerstion my persol reports about things where as other medical providers in the past have blown me off and insisted Im reporting symptoms wrong etc.
0.600000	I feel like they care more about the business of making people sick and medicine.  Rather than the person whose coming for help. I also have been told that I was too big and lazy. I'm 5ft 7.5 inches tall and only weighed 160 pounds.
0.800000	I have only been to my present PCP once, and have not completely formed opinions making it difficult to answer the questions on this page.  However, I was favorably impressed by him and intend to keep using him for the foreseeable future.
0.560000	My primary care physician seems inexperienced and doesn't give an educated opinion of my symptoms. She doesn't ask many questions of give helpful solutions to my medical problems.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she has never been wrong in diagnosing me. She has a caring and concerned bedside manner.
0.520000	Doctors only know what they are taught and rarely, in my experiences, actually do more research.  As a result, I dont have much trust in drs.
0.720000	I trust my doctor for the most part.  A doctor isn't always aware of all the side effects of a medication or its interactions with other medications.  Medicine is changing very quickly and it is hard to keep up with the latest developments.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because she takes care of me and my baby so i chose her and trust her.
0.800000	I put my trust in my doctor because I think they know what's best for me and I 100% trust their decisions 
0.560000	My doctor is not as thorough as I would like him to be. I mean he seems to care when you talk to him but he's a pill doctor. When I first got diagnosed with hyperthyroidism he seemed not to even know what that was! He's concerning but not thorough
0.640000	i trust medical professionals in general because i understand the job and pressures associated with the profession.
0.760000	I trust my Dr because, I'm feeling better than I was years back.  Also I believe my Dr is listing compared to my former Dr's.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because so far he has been of a great help to me. Everything that he has told me so far to improved my health has been working. I agree and trust his work of expertise.
0.440000	My primary care physician always seems to be in a hurry and I don't like how he refers me to a specialist for just about everything. 
0.800000	My primary care physician has never given me a reason to distrust him. He is always willing to listen to what is bothering me, give his professional opinion of the cause, and let me choose from the treatment options available. Over time, he has earned my complete trust.
0.760000	They know more than i do, but i always do some research for myself to see if i'm in close range to what they are thinking 
0.400000	I find that they are all about the bottom line. They often either ignore your complaints, don't take into consideration the HUMAN with feelings behind the symptoms, or worse, they go on a great zebra hunt when a horse is staring them in the face, more to cover their asses against malpractice than for the patient's welfare. If you are not attractive and/or young, healthcare declines.  I can figure out what is wrong with me faster on google than I can by going to the doctor and BE RIGHT.
0.200000	because they try to lie to me that im going to be fine when in reality im not fine....
0.680000	Regarding doctors in general, I have trust in them because I have no other choice. I have to trust that my doctor has my interest in mind. However, I am also aware that many doctors are often sponsored my drug companies, or they could just be wrong about certain medical opinions. Therefore, it is necessary to get a second opinion. 
0.840000	I put complete trust in my doctor because he has been my doctor for many many years. He knows all about my health and medical needs. He is straight forward with me. He has never lied to me to benefit himself.
0.560000	My primary care physician sometimes did not respond to my request about different treatment options. She swayed me into a specific option without asking my opinion. My friends got a certain treatment option but she did not even let me ask for that,
0.640000	I feel like I can trust my doctor to listen to me and answer my questions correctly.  However, if I forget something or don't ask the question correctly I fell like things have or will be missed.  This has happened.  I do so much of my own research before appointments I try and make sure that I pretty much already know the answers and he just confirms or corrects.
0.800000	I trust my doctors.  When I don't I find a new one.  My current PCP is friendly, honest and gives me a feeling that she cares about my well being.
0.640000	I mostly trust my doctor. I think though that physicians generally think people are not smart enough to really understand medical information so they over simplify information or leave out certain information. My doctor is somewhat like this.
0.800000	He asks what is bothering me and makes different appointments for different medical problems that I might need to do to better my health.
0.640000	"Almost all primary-care physicians are driven by market forces and social need to see more patients per day than they really should. I think this leads them to make ""snap"" decisions without spending a lot of time considering possible alternatives; the ""easy"" answer isn't always the right one. I sometime distrust my doctor's opinion when I feel he wants to rush through answers or complicated diagnoses without really considering whether they're totally correct or whether I understand them fully. I recognize their dilemma, but will not allow it to stop me from getting all the info I need on my medical condition."
0.800000	My doctor is good because he is older and experienced. He is not overly persoble or chatty, so I don't feel a closeness with him. That is okay to me, as long as he is doing a thorough job. I know he has a lot of patients, so I never feel like I am getting extremely persolized attention, but he is a pro.
0.600000	to be honest I have really never trusted doctors  but the doctor I have I trust him sometimes I have my doubts about him but he really seems to know what he is doing and I guess I trust him more than I would any other doctor 
0.800000	She spends the time necessary to make sure I understand everything we talk about and about treatment options.  She herself always calls me with test results and asks if I have any questions.  She never makes me feel rushed. 
0.440000	Doctors are human just like I am.  Some are good, some are bad.  It is up to me to question what I'm told and help find solutions.  If they won't work with me I'll find someone else.
0.680000	I do not always completely trust doctors. On simple diagnoses yes, I do trust them but as far as more complex health issues I would rather get a second opinion as well just to be certain that the diagnosis is correct. 
0.680000	They seem to care about the patient's well being rather than their financial benefit. Often times, some are willing to discuss concerns outside business hours.
1.000000	My primary care physician is a really responsible and nice person. Actually, the doctors I saw in general are responsible and nice. Based on how they treated me every time, very professiol and knowledgeable; how they spent time explaining things to me, answering my questions with great patience, even stupid questions sometimes. If I have problems with meds or my symptoms, I can call their offices and get quick responses. I will get a phone call reminding me about my upcoming treatments and appointments. I feel that I can completely trust them to take care of my health.
0.920000	In the past, my doctor has been very receptive to my needs as a patient. He has taken the time to explain to me anything I did not understand.
0.480000	I do have trust in my PCP - as he is intelligent and qualified, but he runs a busy office and I often times feel as though he rushed through the process or appointment. 
0.800000	I have total trust in my physician,  If I didn't, I would find another one in which I did trust.  I have never felt misled or lied to,  I feel as though they are looking out for my health, and helping me stay healthy. 
0.560000	My doctor doesn't thoroughly talk about any diagnosis. My doctor also seems to always be in rush. I appreciate though that my doctor does seem to take an interest in being there and providing steps.
0.440000	too rushed, not enough time for appointment because they are running behind all day. too many patients.
1.000000	As I mentioned earlier, I've had the same doctor for a long time. I almost consider him a friend at this point. He may be one way with other people but with me I knowhe's completely honest and cares about my health over his wallet or time.
0.560000	I do not have a primary care provider. i normally go to urgent care if I am sick or if I have an issue that needs to be addressed.
1.000000	because my primary care physician tells me everything no need to know weather good or bad.she dose not hide anything from me and is always in my best intrest.
0.680000	I feel like I need to trust them because that is what they have studied and trained to do for many years. Though I have experienced negative situations in hospitals that have made me feel somewhat distrustful. I have been present in situations where a doctor has taken too long or has not demonstrated much importance when trying to be reached with questions. Sometimes they have so many situations going on at once, that it would seem they forget some patients.
0.680000	I think most of them try what's best for a patient. They might not be right, but their heart's in it. I think they make mistakes, but as long as they're not too stubborn to change what they're doing.
0.400000	I distrust my doctor because I go to the VA for my healthcare and they really don't seem to hire or keep the best of medical providers there. They are always in a rush and don't seem to really care to give the time of day to your problems they are all very low quality providers. So, that is why I do not trust my physician. 
0.600000	Doctors in far to big of a hurry. If you get ten minutes with the doctor I think you did very well. I feel they just push through to get to the next person so they can make that money.
0.440000	I am very open with my physician so I tend to trust him with most decisions, but it's my body and I want to have the fil say. I believe that all people are inherently selfish, and so I am scared that if I let my guard down, people will take advantage of me. I'm not a trusting person, so even if I agree with my doctor on a major issue, like surgery, I would still want to go to another doctor and get a second opinion, because my health is very important to me. 
0.840000	I completely without a shadow of a doubt have complete and total trust in my PHYSICIAN. He and She ate awesome in what they do
0.760000	Well I trust my Doctors sometimes. I think they have my best interest in mind, but I can overcome the nagging feeling that them just a paycheck to them
0.600000	I feel that the doctor has too many uncertain opinions at times. They run a practice and go by what you tell them and form opinions. However, some things they do know and i give them credit for.
0.840000	I feel like my doctor would never lead me in the wrong direction when it comes to making decisions just based off past experience. Sometimes I don't always agree with his decisions and he knows that but we always do what we both think is best for me.
0.840000	I usually trust my primary care physician as I am taking treatment with her for a long time and she is a good friend of me and she used to give a good treatment and guide me in good manner.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to an extent. I am aware that no one doctor has all of the answers so i try to take her advice with a grain of salt
0.680000	I do not think sometimes they are getting the whole picture when you only spend a few minutes with them every three months. All in all I trust my doctor only a little bit.
0.520000	Sometimes I feel I want to trust what she says but other times I feel like she's not even aware of my problems. She tends to focus on things that don't need to be done versus helping me with my true problems. I feel she is overwhelmed with other things and patients and I am just a number on a chart and not a real person.  
0.880000	I have some very negative experiences with doctors trying to treat beyond their personal capabilities. My current doctor is great at discussing the problem, and if he does not feel totally confident in a procedure or treatment, I get a referral to a specialist. I love it.
0.600000	I trust my doctor they went to school to learn this stuff so I would hope they know exactly what they are telling me and what medicine they are giving me
0.800000	They have gone to school to learn what they are doing and I have been going to them for a while and learned to trust what they have to say.  I have a good comfort level with them, and if you can't trust your doctor, you should change them.
0.840000	I trust doctors to make the best decisions for their patients if they are given all the information that is available.
0.800000	I have always had very good doctors and fully trust there opinions. Both of my parents are doctors and I think that influences my opinions of doctors. I trust my parents so I trust other doctors too. I have never had reason to not trust my doctors.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she has always listened to my issues and questions.  She always gets back to me with an answer if I happen to email or call her.  I have always felt safe and well taken care of and I never worry about her not getting back to me.  She really cares about me and my well-being and it shows in her interactions with me.
0.560000	I do not know my current PCP well.  She is the 3rd PCP I have had in as many years. One doctor retired and the next one moved to an employee health position.Once I get to know a doctor and they get to know me we can work together equally to give me a positive outcome.  I have been on Medicare less than a year.  There are many changes in what a physician is allowed to prescribe for different parameters.  Each stage of life has it's own learning curb.
0.960000	I can relate to my doctor with some challenges that we've faced with our kids.  He is my son's doctor also (Family Practice). He gets it.  He is very professiol but could not hide his frustration with the school system for special needs children.  It really helped me to not feel alone especially with a doctor who is so understanding.  He has such a good bedside manner.  He really does care about my son and I as his patients.  I truly feel that he gives his best advice and I would trust him with any health concern that I have.
0.520000	I don't completely trust my primary care physician because I think he is mostly in it for the money.  He knows that I am very limited financially, yet he insists that I make an appointment to see him for any prescription refills, even if I just saw him two days before.  He routinely prescribes the most expensive drugs, knowing that I can't afford them.  On top of that, his office routinely charges me double what my co-pay is supposed to be.  
0.560000	I trust my physician because they do the best of all that they can. With telling yiu everything you want to hear.
0.760000	why not trust someone whose job is to make you better? its their job so i feel like they would want to be honest and help me as much as they can
0.800000	In general I trust my primary care physician. I haven't had a reason ever to distrust him. He has always been helpful and courteous, I think the care is of good quality.
0.920000	I trust my doctor to give me what I should know about my health although you still have some douth no matter who
0.720000	"I trust my physician because he is a trained and qualified professiol. Even if he ""cares more about what is convenient for him than about my medical needs"", I can not know about it. He would not tell me. I can only trust him."
0.720000	While I sometimes feel like I'm another patient being flown through the door, and husled along. My doctor usually is very thorough and will sit and discuss anything that I need to talk about.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he is very in tuned to my needs and is constantly learned more about medical needs.
0.560000	In general, I trust my primary care physician. I think she is trying her best to provide good medical care to meet my  needs.  However, I think sometimes she may not listen to my point of view and may instead rely on her own experiences and training too much, as opposed to seeing what may work uniquely for me as an individual.  However, I do feel like she cares and does a thorough job overall.
0.440000	I trust doctors to some extent to in most cases try to help. However I do feel they sometimes think of themselves or money they make from kickbacks 
0.840000	I have went through hip replacement serg and my Drs were very helpful, explaining everything to me. I trusted what they had to say and I followed their advice 
1.000000	down to earth, admits when he doesnt know something, is more then helpful and up front
0.720000	I currently do not have a primary care physician and have not seen one in over 20 years.  I can not afford medical insurance for myself at the moment.
0.760000	I have no reason not to trust my primary care doctor.  If I have a problem, I can ask my doctor anything.
1.000000	I would trust her with my life she has always been completely open wiyh me about everything that is wrong
0.800000	I have been seeing my doctor for years and they always seem to be able to fix my problem and seem concerned about my well being.  I have trust that they will continue to fix and help my issues as they arise.
0.600000	first of all my primary care physician doesn't show up to work on a the regular basis and also he always smells like alcohol and do not have that much knowledge in medicine.
0.440000	I feel like doctors get commission for prescriptions that vendors tell them to sell, like hey sell 10 of these and we'll give you 1k, so all these doctors all they do is prescribe shit 
0.800000	I trust them because they are supposed to be the experts.  If i go to a doctor and i feel like their diagnosis isn't right, I will go get another opinion.  I trust them until they give me a reason not to.
0.600000	There are a lot of changes in medicine constantly and there are a ton of options it would probably take days  to cover the ones for each condition. Doctors tend to go with the simplest or maybe cheapest if that is the way insurance providers make you go. Sometimes the best answer is not simple or cheap.
0.960000	i believe they tell you the truth about everything and they are sincere and most of them are good doctors and treat there paitents very good i have a very good doctor who is always there when i need him
0.800000	I have had no negative or bad experiences with the care I have received from my primary physician.  I do not seek medical attention very often. I sometimes research on the internet conditions and  symptoms about diagnoses 
0.840000	He is honest and upfront. He listens to my needs and answers any questions I may have without making me feel rushed
0.960000	My doctor always take the time to explain things to me.  My doctor never makes me feel rushed.
0.680000	I think that they are not intentionally trying to do wrong by me. However, I do know that doctors often do not have the time to keep up to date with all of the latest advances in healthcare. So it's important to double-check any recommendations yourself.
0.520000	I generally trust them but at the end of the day they are they to make money and not just to help me or  to make me feel better so I have to take everything they say or recommend or do with a grain of salt and seek other opinions
0.720000	While I do trust my doctor, I still seek out additional information when I feel it necessary.  My doctor has never violated my trust.  I still feel like you can't be too careful, because everyone has bad days and could miss something.
0.360000	My Primary care physician is actually pretty decent. She knows what she is talking about most of the time and is honest when she doesn't. That being said, she has been wrong about a few things, and is not as turally or holistically minded as I would like
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she's willing to answer questions. I don't ever feel she's rushing me or dismissing my concerns. If I ask about altertives she gives a lot of facts - I like to hear it all and not generalized statements meant to pacify.
0.840000	I've had my primary care physician for a very long time and they always give me good recommendations based off of the life that they know I want to live. For example, I'm not really into taking medications if I can help it so if something can be aided naturally by eating healthier or exercising more, they nudge me in that path. Obviously if I have a severe cold or infection, I take their prescription that they recommend but they are aware that if I have to work a little harder to set a goal to get back on track, I'll take that path. And I really appreciate that from them!
0.560000	I am neutral in trusting my primary care physician due to having a negative experience during my childhood where I was misdiagnosed multiple times and given wrong advice/information regarding my health. It got to the point where it was almost too late for me to survive because my parents were being told that their child only had a cold/fever. Outside of that experience, I normally do not put that much trust in a person regardless of it being their profession because some people only have their own interests in mind.
0.320000	Doctors only care about shoving pills and expensive treatments at their patients.  They care about money and not how to fix issues with patients. 
0.680000	I know my doctor knows more about me than I know about myself health wise. Some things I really dont feel comfortable speaking about with anyone. This is usually the case with the doctor, as I do trust what he/she will tell me but comfort isnt always there. Sometimes I get angry with my doctor as well when I hear things I dont want to hear. Especially when telling me to change certain habits I have had for years. I do also use the internet to self diagnose myself and certain sicknesses I get. Sometimes its really just a tossup on if I want to ask or not about something. 
0.800000	Sometimes they can be telling you the truth. But sometimes they can be telling you lie. So you have to reach it frist.
0.360000	He took me off a dangerous medication without out weening me off without caring about side effects of quitting cold turkey I.lost weight I can't sleep my anxiety spiked up I'm.jittery
0.800000	My doctor always spends a good amount of time talking to me when I go for a visit and answers all my questions thoroughly.
0.880000	I trust my physician because they never rush me. I trust my physician because they always take time to explain complicated diagnoses or procedures to me. I trust my physician because they always smile whenever we interact. I trust my physician because they are great with going the extra mile to make sure I confident in my healthcare decisions by making sure I fully understand and risks associated.
0.680000	I haven't seen a doctor in a long time, and my recent visit had me feeling a bit wary about everything. I was worried about the cost of everything, and listening to my doctor talk about going to see some specialist for one thing, and a specialist for another thing made me very alert and unwilling to agree to either one. I just don't believe I have complete trust in the American Healthcare System and its practices, in regards to cost for the patient. I.e. a saline bag being charged at $100, when they are manufactured at perhaps $0.25
0.760000	My primary care physician has seen me a few times and has always thoroughly explained information about my health with me.  These discussions are backed up by data, and the correlations between what I am being told by my physician and the data I am being shown align.
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general. However, since I am not an expert in the field of medicine, there are times when I feel really sick and have to consult a doctor. In such situations, I try my best to ask all possible questions that I have about my illness and the course of action suggested by the doctor. Only if I am completely satisfied with the answers will I follow the advise given by the doctor. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, then I will either seek a second opinion (if I am very sick) or treat myself with home remedies.
0.600000	He's fine for check ups but quick to refer me to a specialist without trying a treatment first.  After I see the specialist, my family doctor defers to them and doesn't stay in the loop.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because i've been going to him for years and years,  and after every checkup and everytime i've went to his office i've just got a good wholesome feeling from their practice. I just get the sense that he just wants what is best for me and my family.
0.600000	I used to hae a primary doctor that I completely trusted. Now, he is retired,so I do not trust doctors so much!
0.760000	I trust my PC because she listens to me and what I am trying to accomplish. She hears me and allows me to have a say in if I want to take medicine, approach things a certain way. She cares. 
0.720000	He has never held back on what he thinks is best for me. He speaks plainly and bluntly about what I need to help me get over my conditions if that is something that can be done. He does not play games or go easy on my feelings he tells it like it is. I like a doctor who gets to the point and gives me the bad and good without trying to downplay how bad something is. 
0.640000	Sometimes it depends on the time spent in the room with me. Or the reason I am there for the visit. They may try to make me take a medication when we have discussed before that it doesn't work it doesn't help. Orsuggesting other tests etc to have more intake, but u don't know. Each doctor is defiNitleu different.
0.960000	...he is young, discusses his research findings & current opinions, not his personal ones, seeks my input, answers my questions and solicits options, recites what he is documenting, shares printouts w/me of what he has documented & discusses OUR plans. However, he does rely on computers more than I prefer & at times, selections within the computer are not available to address my actual concerns; for example, pain in forearm-nurse only found elbow pain in computer so entered that-PCP discussed elbow pain-redirected to discuss pain in forearm-he kept discussing elbow pain so offered options for that-I declined option for elbow pain & redirected discussion to pain in forearm to no avail, asked perhaps muscle?-ignored/dismissed/discounted? documented tennis elbow & that I declined tennis elbow splint which I did...oh well, another appointment next month to address pain in forearm, partially researched it, found muscle termed brachial-radialis (sp), more to do so am prepared for discussion on next appointment, takes a team to 'git 'er did'! Oh, pain in forearm was only one of other concerns for office visit (monthly weight loss management regime f/u, feeling of something in throat when swallowing, unlike history of swollen tonsils (US ordered), recent pain in forearm when lifting heavy objects). Thank you ~
1.000000	My doctor is amazing. We have a great relationship and I fully trust her to tell me the truth and to go over everything with me.
0.600000	I think my doctor is knowledgeable however I sometimes feel rushed during appointments.  My doctor answers my questions but I feel like he doesn't want to take the time to thoroughly answer everything.
0.840000	I trust doctors because ultimately, I visit them because I'm not an expert in regards to health and medicine and because they have the means to help me. They're the ones with the expert knowledge. If I do think that they're doing something questionable, I would consult yet another doctor. Furthermore, doctors tend to be high on empathy and people who study this career did it because they wanted to, no one forced them to do it. I think this makes them more trustworthy.
0.800000	i trust my doctor because they know i'm a nurse and we are able to communicate in the same medical terms.
0.560000	I do trust my doctor but to a sense. Sometimes I feel like he just wants to hurry me out of the room to go on to the next patient. When I try to explain something that might be wrong he kind of dismisses it. But I do know that he will try to help out for issues that are already present.
0.600000	Health system is so costly everyone seems to be able to become easily wealthy on their patients expense. High medical bill, high medicine cost, high everything.
0.800000	I do not know my doctor very well but the contact. Inhave had with her is all positive. She has answered all my questions and has been correct in her diagnosis of my conditions.
0.560000	From what I've seen in the past several years, their too much emphasis on time magement and payroll correlation than on what's really beneficial for the patient. Issues are only addressed if it's convenient for the doctor and his/her staff. 
0.640000	She sometimes will not listen to me and its my body. I once had to fix my ear infection because she would not help me. Now she listens to me.
0.760000	I do have a lot of trust in my physician as he has always been there for me, he tries very hard to get me n to see him in case of an emergency, and he has even called me at home to check on me, after I have seen him.
0.760000	my doctor is head of Neurology at a very large and well known teaching hospital in Alabama. My doctor has operated on my brain and I can still walk and talk but I am blind and deaf on my right side. I would rather be blind/deaf on one side than be paralyzed. I had a brain tumor and one doctor wanted to remove 100% which would have resulted in me being paralyzed. Thanks to my Mom's knowledge, I switched hospitals and neurosurgeons and I am not paralyzed. I do have 20% of tumor wrapped around my brainstem but 80% of tumor was removed by my current doctor
0.480000	"At the moment my primary care physician is a nurses assistant, not an actual DR. thanks to my insurance.  She is kind of knowledgeable but at my last visit she had to ""Ask Dr. Google""  to answer one of my questions which not only worries me but is something I could do myself for free."
0.880000	Most of the time I feel like I can trust my doctor. He obviously knows more about health than I do. I don't think he would steer my care in the wrong direction, and it never seems like he is trying to push some unneeded treatment on me for something silly (i.e. restless leg syndrome or something like that) that would make me think he is being paid a commission by pharmaceuticals.
0.840000	Overall, I trust my physician.  That isn't to say that I won't seek out more information on a subject after getting my physician's opinion.  I will take what she tells me as a stepping point to learning more for myself.  My physician has shown to be open to Western Culture health care in addition to Eastern Culture health care, and that matters to me.  She is always warm and kind, and strikes me as genuine.
0.840000	I've been going to my primary physician for years, he's always tried to help me to the best of his ability.
0.600000	i trust my doctors to a certain extent but you cannot trust anyone completely. i dont have any specific complaints about my current doctors. 
0.760000	He spendsa gooda mount of time with me and makes me keep track of important health information and give it to him on our visits...then he really studies the info i give him.
0.640000	Don't have primary care physician but don't completely trust doctors because if patients get well doctors out of business.  Also push too many pills.
0.880000	My primary care physician treats me as a person she knows and about my well being physically spiritually emotionally and psychology.  She is very calm but direct and thoughtful. 
0.800000	My physician is highly regarded and always takes the appropriate amount of time to see me. He doesn't rush me out of his office for other patients, and I feel that he gives me his full attention.
0.440000	My primary care doctor is a group of doctors on the base. And sometimes they switch which one will see me for whatever the appointment is for. 
0.720000	My doctor is great.  He doesn't talk down to me because of my GAD and PTSD, and he listens to me.  He has absolutely no problem admitting that he doesn't know everything, and refers me to a specialist for things he feels are out of his field of knowledge.  He's also got common sense.
0.880000	I completely trust my primary care physician because I have been with him for years, and we have developed a very realistic relationship. He has always been very honest with me in regards to my health, even if he knows it's not something I want to hear, and he portrays how much he cares during our visits. 
0.920000	She is a family friend. She takes the time to check on me as a person and not just what is written on the chart for the reason I am visiting her.  She touches up on multiple aspects of my life as far as family, physical activity, emotional state, and other things that may have an influence on my health.
0.760000	I always trusted my doctor because they always know how my health is at good level when they check it and that's why I always like my doctor.
0.600000	I do and dont trust them but i know they mean best interest at heart for trearment and health conditions
0.720000	Dr's goto medical school so they know their health. Sometimes people dont want to hear that they are sick so they might want to disagree with the Dr. to feel better in a sense of denial. I think medical school vs. no school its better to trust the dr.
0.760000	My doctor has always been very open and honest with me and she has not had an issue telling me how she feels in regards to my own health and well being.
0.880000	My physicians assistant is very kind, listens, engaging, good sense of humor and makes me feel comfortable. He does not make me feel bad about myself if i am unsure or if i feel the need to vent or unload about a situation that is tied to feeling unwell to my situation. I would be very upset if he changes practices. 
0.600000	Looking for another doctor in the city
0.680000	I don't always believe that I can trust physicians in general. I believe that some of them care more about marketing certain products or services and they try to sell it to you, without being honest about the products and it's side effects etc. 
0.480000	This is more about the doctor I see most often which is my gastroenterologist, he always seems to be pushing me to non-generic drugs even though I like the way my body reacts to what I am currently taking.  I also feel he pushed me into an endoscopy I did not at all need, just to get another year supply of a drug I depend on.  All in all that cost me $2500 out of pocket that I couldn't afford at the time. 
0.600000	I trust my primary physician, because they are consistent about my well being. They always asked if I need anything or any questions I need to ask, or about any problems former or current.
0.560000	The least that doctors can do is provide guidelines.
1.000000	I trust my primary care doctor.  I have a very open relationship with him.  He will tell me the good things as well as the bad things.  I think that he is focused on recommending the best things for me as a patient.  I believe that his recommendations change based on the patients that he is dealing with.
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for a long time.  she always gives me good and trust advise
0.600000	I neither trust or distrust my current primary care physician because I currently do not have a primary care physician
1.000000	i trust them because there honest and genuine and really nice also they really care about my health and well being 
0.480000	I do think that having different insurances make a huge difference in how you are treated and what treatments are available
0.440000	The medical system now exists to benefit companies and not the people, they look at us like we are machines but we have feelings and concerns that often go unnoticed 
0.400000	I donât really trust my doctors completely. They tend to never give me options and just go with what they want me to do. I went in for back pain and I asked to be sent to chiropractor, but she was a firm believer in physical therapy, so denied my request and sent me to physical therapy which didnât help and she still refuses to do what I think is right for my health. 
0.760000	I trust my primary physician because they went to school to become a physician so I know they pretty much know what they talking about and have my best interest.  I wouldn't trust them if every time something happens and I ask questions and nothing works out 
0.560000	I can't say I completely trust my general doctor, I mean, he has given me good attention for a whole year and he treats me well but sometimes I think he cares more about making money than myself as he makes me do many tests in the same hospital where he is. It's kind of suspicious.
0.760000	I feel he listens to my concerns and takes the time to listen to what I have to say and clearly explain my options.
0.800000	I guess if I had to think about it, I would have a hard time coming up with a reason not to trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing him since I stopped seeing my pediatric doctor when I was a teen. He has never led me wrong or given me trouble about my prescriptions when I needed to get them filled. I also see a psychiatrist for anxiety and he provides me with the medicine needed to treat my panic disorder. I have been seeing him for over a decade and by now I only need to see him for a quick appointment once every three months because he knows me so well.
0.680000	HE LISTENS TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING MY TYPE 2 DIABETES OR OTHER CONDITION I MAY HAVE.  IF I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING HE SAYS HE TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER THEM RATHER THAN PUTTING ME OFF WITH A HALF ASSED ANSWER BUT RATHER GIVES A THOUGHTFUL ANSWER IN TERMS I CAN UNDERSTAND RATHER THEN SAYING THINGS I NEED A MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTAND.  THIS GOES FOR MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MY UROLOGIST AND MY ENDOCRONOLOGIST 
0.400000	My primary care doctor usually seems rushed and annoyed. I can tell she wants to do her job but perhaps doesn't like the scheduling or the company that mages her. Overall I don't really trust her to make educated decisions for me, and had to beg for a cholesterol test. It had been six years, at least, since my prior one. 
0.720000	I trust that most doctors are just trying to be helpful but I still double check things with my grandmother since she's a nurse
0.800000	In a couple of different appointments, I've asked about certain treatments or options for ailments and my doctor is very forthcoming.  Normally if he thinks it's overpriced hogwash, he'll give me his honest opinion.  He's also happily given me referrals to doctor's offices and recommendations to quality referrals for things that are recommended like an annual skin screening to proactively prevent skin cancer.  I think sometimes doctor's can be a little pill happy to offer them unnecessarily, but mine is usually more calculated and cares about finding a solution. In addition, his thoroughness actually saved a friend's life of mine when she had been complaining and struggling through a health problem with her other doctor, he uncovered a serious situation and got her the care she needed.
1.000000	Doctors in general know what they are doing.  So I trust them in making decisions for me.  I like when a doctor shows empathy for me or any other patient.  
0.920000	i have faith in my dr.i've been seeing her for a long time & believe she has done a good job at keeping me well and healthy. she is up on all of the latest medical problems and treatments. i feel safe in her hands
0.440000	All doctors want is money. Long ago has patent care went away and all people want in the medical field is just money 
0.760000	She appears to be genuinely concerned about my well being. She is approachable and personable. She takes time with me, listens to me, and thoroughly explains.
0.760000	I have been going to him for the past seven years and I trust him completely with my health because If I don't trust him by now I have a serious problem
0.760000	My doctor will sit down and listen to me and my concerns and she will also talk to me in terms that I understand  she will not leave until I fully understand her and what she is saying
0.480000	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to talk to me to understand what my symptoms are and determine what the course of treatment should be.
0.720000	I trust my Physician's because he's the one that take care of me health-wise, and make sure that I am on the right path and and in good health.
0.520000	Follow up information is idequate.
0.640000	I don't mistrust, it's just that she has a lot of patients. She does what she has to do for my care, but not above and beyond the call of duty in opinion.
0.880000	I think that when it comes to healthcare you should trust but verify. I think that there is a common way to deal with problems, but it is not always what is best for your undiviual needs. I like to learn what my doctor recommends but also look for other options and tural treatments as well. I think my doctor is awesome, but she is just human, and therefore it is important to have other ways of obtaining other opionons. 
0.720000	My doctor does not half ass his way just to get a job done. He actually talks to me and makes sure that I understand what is going on and what I need to do. Most physicians will look out for their patients because they are under their care and their reputation is on the line. 
0.520000	Haven't had all that many interactions with primary care doctors but they're usually rushed and seem more about getting through the interaction than anything else. Jaded, too.
0.840000	I have no reason not to trust my primary care physician.  She has always been straight forward with me.  She listens, investigates the problems, provides a solution, and if the solution is not working, then we work together to find another solution.  I wouldn't say i have complete faith in her, but i trust her and her ability very much.
0.600000	I trust my priamary care because I have seen her for many years and has always taken good care of me
0.760000	I trust my doctor because when I go in for a visit, she listens to me and usually has more than one option to try without immediately going to medicine. I feel like I am heard and she typically solves my problems without multiple visits of trial and error.
0.600000	I trust him because he is a good doctor that has always been able to treat what I am to see him for.  He is been in the same place for many years and has many patients so he must know what he is doing to stay in the same place for so long retaining so many patients.
0.960000	HE is very detailed and asks lots of questions and takes his time to answer each question and provide concise answers
0.800000	I believe my primary care physician is trustworthy.  He came up as a PA from the previous doctor that was there at the practice and the retired doctor was very much a people person.  The current doctor has learned a lot from him but is now more of people person as well.  I trust him because he will follow up with questions and answers to treatment options.
0.520000	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for approximately 7 years now; she gradually earned my trust...Have had a few bad experiences with doctors in the past, and by far, she has been the best to date...
0.880000	My doctor is a blunt and give it to you like it is! I love that fact about him he does not sugar coat anything and tell me what I need to hear; not what I want to hear. I understand his boldness and the way he breaks things down so I have a clear understanding.
0.760000	I could only say that I can't agree totally on number one because I have personally seen that my doctor's waiting room was empty without patients being seen at the time and have still been made to wait excessive amounts of time for my own appointments on numerous occasions.
0.760000	I do not distrust my primary care physician. I have no reason not to trust her by any means. I trust her completely. 
0.920000	he always answers all of my questions, explaining things in a way that i as a non-medical person, can comprehend.
0.640000	I think most doctors have the best intentions and do truly want to help but I feel like they are put in the position where they are not allowed to give their patients the time they need to in order to do their job thoroughly.
0.840000	I have spent a lot of time over the years finding a woman's doctor oh finally on the third doctor in about six years I found a doctor that I really like. I trust her a lot and I believe that she gives me her honest opinion on things,  she will leave and go out of her way to tell me practices that used to be performed which are as widely practiced anymore. Myother main doctor is for my sleep condition. I've been going to see him for over year and I trust his guidance as well. 
0.720000	It's never occurred to me not to trust her. She seems to explain things well. I don't know how to expand on this answer - it's never something I've thought about before. 
0.880000	He makes the time to talk with me and ask me if I have any questions. He never seems to be in a rush or rush me. He has made good decisions for me in the past.
0.760000	I've been seeing him for +10 years. He's extremely thorough. I could complain about a slight ache and he'd order a whole x-ray just to be sure nothing else is going on. He's very competent and has listened to me in the past and talked to me
1.000000	I've been going to my primary care physician since I was a teeger. I've had some medical issues that he's helped me to resolve over the years. He's had his practice for a long time and has never given me a reason to not trust him or his staff.
0.800000	she makes sure I take care of my self by making sure I see my specialist andd double checking what they say
0.960000	My doctor takes the time to explain my over all health and where it should be. My doctor also takes the time to listen to my concerns and explains all my options as well as the risk of those options
0.800000	Most of the doctors I have been in contact with recently seemed to have my best care in mind. I recently hurt my shoulder and needed to go to the Orthopedic Surgeon for car. While I had not been to this Ortho before, he was very thorough and explained the cost/benefits of the treatment plan he had set for me. However, I find that interacting with other medical staff, such as psychiatrists, RNs, LPNs, that they are much more business-oriented, in and out. For those types of specialists/general staff I do not have as much trust as I do my PCP or Ortho.
0.600000	Most of the time I do trust them.  I do think sometimes they are running on autopilot.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because they had my best interest and heart and always has been honest with me. My has been truthful with me from days one.
0.480000	I don't know her well yet, and I've only seen her three times. Also, I prefer natural medicine when possible, which medical doctors tend to stay away from. 
0.640000	I have been having a growing feeling that my doctor is not doing all he can to help me lower my blood pressure. The medication I am using now, the fourth, is not working very well at all.
1.000000	I have not had a situation when my doctor has been wrong or dishonest. She always goes over any options I may have. She explains everything clearly and is open to answer any of my questions.
0.600000	There hasn't be a major illness I've had to deal with in my life or my family members life.
0.800000	He is very thorough in running tests to make sure I am healthy.  I feel confident in his ability to answer any questions I have.  He takes the time to sit and talk directly with me about any concerns that I have.  He is very patient and I feel concerned about my well being.
0.600000	I've recently switched doctors and only seen the new one once so I haven't formed a real solid opioion yet, but so far she seems nice and interested and takes her time and listens when I talk so far all is good. Time will tell. 
0.800000	I distrust the doctor sometimes because I'm unable at times to get proper medicine I need for pain. However, I do trust the doctor with filling me in on information about my health.
0.520000	Distrust as he's not always forthcoming. Had a recent incident which resulted in x-ray and he deliberately misdiagnosed it. Protecting someone.
0.600000	doctors are too busy seeing people that they have trouble keeping up with the new things that are being learned.
1.000000	I trust my physician because she is very thorough and is very caring. I also trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable and knows what she is doing.
0.680000	She spends more than 5 minutes during appts and seems to listen when I have problems or issues that need addresses
0.840000	the reason by take this survey is easy, medical situacion in my household is critic, i can produce this service with surveys.
1.000000	Out of the plethora of doctors I have seen in my life, only two stand out; one I used to see in another state before we moved and my current doctor.  My current doctor tells it like it is and doesn't sugar-coat anything.  Actually, he is quite assertive with me and I respond well to that.
1.000000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR COMPLETELY.   IT IS VERY EASY TO TALK TO HER AND TO SEE THAT SHE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON.  SHE HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG WITH ME AND I HAVE LEARNED VERY MUCH FROM DURING THE FEW YRS I HAVE BEEN SEEING HER ABOUT MY HEALTH ISSUES
0.800000	She has always explained things to my satisfaction, both medically and with regard to insurance.  She has helped me and noticed other issues that I didn't really pay attention to, which I really appreciate.  She works hard to help me in any way.
0.560000	Most doctors dont examine you on a machine you go. There is no one on one communication. The doctor only spends five to eight mintueds with you.
0.920000	She is dependable and caring, Her husband performed my surgery and she has maintained my health since then she has been very honest about my progress,even when its not necessarily what I wanted to hear
0.320000	I feel like my visits are just to get me in and out.  The last PCP I had did not ask about my condition on my 2nd visit, and ignored my intense back pain when I told her about it.
0.560000	He has resolved several medical issues that other doctors could not help me with in the past. He ask questI on to get to the heart of the situation
0.520000	I know that they know what they are talking about but I feel that I get lost in the shuffle of other patients. I feel like they are quick with me to move on to the next person. I really don't know what to believe when it comes to what my doctors are telling me. I believe about half.
0.560000	Doctors are humans too and sometimes they might be limited or bound by other things like insurance, law (like they can't insist/suggest rather strongly on doing something when you don't want to) etc. Doctors can make mistake and that's why you always need your second opinion (or even third sometimes).
0.880000	"I don't ""completely"" trust anyone, but do I believe my doc is being honest and upfront with me?   Yes.    Not that I wouldn't get a second opinion if I had a serious illness, that's a common sense thing.  "
0.920000	i trust them because I have known them for a long time and they have done very well by me, he listens to me and lets me talk and give my opinions
0.240000	Over the years the doctors have done vary little to help with my disease other than take my money, give me medication that does nothing or makes me feel worse, or give me no hope at all. I have been able to do much more for myself than any doctor has
0.680000	It's not that I distrust my physician...I go to a free clinic and some things/meds are limited.  Doctors . in general, sometimes push certain products I  guess.
0.600000	I wont go back cant go back to the way things use to be today is the day I have to go home and cook dinner for my family and if I don't they will be really mad at me and will not talk to me at all for a week and I will be very sad
0.920000	She is always listening to me and showing concerns when I talk to her about what's going on in my life whether it's about my mental or physical health.
0.840000	I have been seeing him for years and he knows what best for me. We both do research on things to see what will work the best.
0.760000	I believe that my doctor has my back because that is his job.  He is competent and pragmatical, and he would undoubtedly explore treatment options with me.
0.640000	most of the time i agree that they are trustworthy, but i can think of times they just want to prescribe something and not care too much about other possibilities 
0.840000	I trust him because I have a lot of experience with doctors due to a heart problem I had several years ago. I know he is conscientious and thorough and he presents all the alternatives to me.
0.720000	I have known my doctor for ten years. He has always been honest and patient with me. He was my doctor through my pregnancies also.
0.800000	I recently changed primary care physicians and I have only had one visit. I am still establishing a relationship with my doctor and building trust with them.
1.000000	I have been with my physician almost my entire life.  He has on more than one occasion diagnosed me with something that the hospital did not.  Everyone in my town looks up to this man as a talented diagnostician.  If I need a note, he never objects, he always helps me out of things if I need it.  I even have his cell phone if there is an emergency, and he has neglected to charge me a few times when I have been going through financial hardships.  He cares deeply about all his patients and it really shows.
0.800000	I have only been going to him for 6 months but his dad has been a doctor in town for 30 years. He seems to be caring, knowledgeable and a good listener.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because the last time I had a medical question to ask, I recognized his answers weren't just answers that benefitted either himself or someone he had close ties to. He informed me of options he that he personally told me he didn't agree with but made sure to say to me he understood my decision is not his yet he wanted me to understand the full picture. He didn't have to do that but he did and with a situation like that made me trust he had my best interest at heart.
0.840000	I think I could trust my primary care physician to give me the care I need. I don't have one currently but I should probably find one. I would prefer a female doctor so I can talk honestly about my needs and concerns without feeling like I am being treated like it's 'all in my head'.
0.840000	I trust my doctor as I have been seeing her for many years now.
0.840000	They are here to help people no matter what is going on with them. They are there to listen. Doctors are there to treat you no matter what
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he has proven trustworthy.  He listens to what I have to say and develops treatment plans based on what he believes the issue is.  He treats the problem and not the symptoms.
0.840000	I feel completely confident in my health care professional. He is very trustworthy and I have never had any issues talking to him about any of my medical problems. 
0.560000	I trust my physician in part but there are things that I think he could miss. Also I like my doctor but he is only human.
0.640000	I don't have complete trust in my doctor - but I would say I trust most of what they say. I am not too big on vaccines anymore, although my daughter does get them as a safety precaution. I don't always trust the meds I am given because sometimes if I suggest something the doctor has said no out of spite. And then a few months later we try the medication I originally suggested and it works great (I am mostly talking about psychiatry there - psychiatry/psychology is a hobby of mine, luckily I have a great psych doctor now!)
0.720000	I trust my doctors medical opinions. First, because it is his or her chosen profession. Second, he or she answers all my questions and addresses all my concerns each visit
0.440000	My insurance recently changed, so I go to a local clinic and never see the same doctor more than once, so I never have a chance at building trust or a relationship with them. Usually, where I go, appointments are only a few moments, regardless of the severity of the reason you go, so I find it hard to believe they're really devoting enough time and energy to treating me in the best possible way.
0.920000	I trust my doctor to some extent where she is trying to give me medicine and helping me stay healthy but at the same time my total belief is in God.
0.560000	I really try and put faith into what they are telling me.  I have been known to challenge them somewhat if the diagnoses does not make any sense to me.
0.800000	I trust my PC because I have been with him for years. He has no steered me wrong in all the years that I have known him.
0.680000	you have to put faith in them. they went to lots of schooling to make sure they can help you when you need it.
0.720000	I respect the intellect of medical advisory of physicians however I have faith greater than any man. I trust that people are in me path of life for a reason whether it's a doctor teacher etc. Subconsciously only believing in faith as my provider of knowledge.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me conflicting or incorrect advice from what I can tell. He always spends a long time with me making sure that I have all concerns addressed. He is professional and courteous and I appreciate his work and attention.
0.800000	Have been seeing them for a long time , and have a lot of confidence in them .When something works I tend to leave my t alone 
0.520000	I think that nowadays, most doctors are about the money that they want to make and they will give you the treatment that cost the most even if a cheaper alternative is available.
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because I have no choice but to, and most of the time i think doctors are usually here to help us so why would they not want to do what is right for their patients.
0.480000	I don't trust the medical system at all and never will. It would be extremely foolish to trust them.
0.880000	My primary care physician tales more time with me than any primary care physician I've ever had. He never rushes my appointment and, in fact, he al,oat always runs late due to his extraordinary care and attentiveness 
0.680000	My doctor has never done anything to not have my trust. He goes out of his way to make me feel comfortable and is willing to go out of his way for me and my family. To the point of calling me after hours when my oldest was sick and not getting better.
0.600000	I think in general most physicians have their patients' best interest in mind.  They are dedicated to providing quality care.  However, some doctors may be more concerned with profits and payments from drug industries so it is important to ask questions.  
0.640000	In general, I think physicians are well trained and probably know what they are talking about.  However, I rarely get a chance to see a physician for more than a few minutes once or twice a year.  There isn't really a chance to build a trusting relationship.  I think the way the health system is set up forces doctors to go for quantity instead of having the opportunity to build real relationships with their patients.  Trust takes time to be earned and I just haven't really had the time to build any with any doctor in years.
0.800000	I trust my healthcare provider because I have been going to him for the past twenty plus some years. My doctors has always done what is best for me and never put his interest before my own health.
0.960000	She's never disappointed me. Every time I go to her, she's right about what's wrong. And the long term treatments help also. 
0.280000	"I feel like everyone is in a hurry and the perception / feelings is no one really cares. Myself and everyone else is just a number out of billions. I feel like I am just a process and not a person. Dr's tend to see all of their patience day to day, hour to hour, week to week for the purpose of the paycheck and the fincial gains. It has nothing to do with health care or the needs and wants of a persons healthcare, it is all about money and big money at that. Healthcare and everyone involved in the healthcare industry is all about the ""Market"" of making money. "
0.200000	I do not trust doctors because I have no reason to trust them. They are doctors because they went to school and got a degree. I trust myself much more.
0.800000	I generally trust doctors because it is in their interest to make people feel better, and they have the training to do that. I think it takes a lot of caring for others to be a doctor and most physicians have the patient's best interests at heart. Most of them are proud of what they do and want to do well. 
1.000000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. I have always had a good experience with them. They are thoughtful and clear and always make sure I have my questions answered.
0.720000	I haven't been with my primary care doctor for very long, so while I don't have a reason to distrust him, I haven't built up enough of a strong relationship yet.
0.640000	It isn't that I distrust him, but I rarely go to the doctor so I don't have many interactions to reference. 
0.760000	I generally trust doctors to provide a reasobly high level of care with persol integrity. However, I know that as in any field, there are fincial, administrative, and moral/ethical pressures weighing on these professiols. I am sure that sometimes they feel that they must go against their preferred ways of behaving and communicating with patients.
0.440000	My doctor acts like a know it all.  It seems like they are in a rush most of the time.  They could be more thoughtful and considerate.
0.760000	I trust my doctors because they answer my questions when I ask them, they don't treat me like a child or an idiot, and they actually pay attention to what I am saying. My doctors are engaged with me as a person and while our goal is to make me feel better, it never feels like the docs are focused on the endgoal - diagonsis - and are instead focused on me and what I need and what I'm feeling. 
0.800000	the dr i have i had for years and so far hasn't given me a problem, had 3 different operations and no problems, to me even with the recommendation of a specialist, had no problems 
0.800000	My doctor has given me no reason not to trust them. They have provided me with the means to help whatever medical issues I have and have even gave me their contact info if it is after hours and I have an immediate need.
0.560000	I have issues with doctors telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They think that they are more than God. 
0.480000	"I don't feel as though a personal relationship of any sort has been established over time and his ""bedside manner"" is curt and distant. I sometimes feel as though I am just another task of the day to get over with as quickly as possible. I do think I need special attention, but become discouraged with I feel that our time is rushed or treated as entirely insignificant. "
0.640000	If I didn't trust them I would stay home. Ginger!
0.680000	I think in general most Doctors, the ones I've seen have your best interest at heart, I don't always agree with everything they say, I believe most doctors are paid to prescribe medications. This makes it hard to completely trust at times.
0.600000	cant really say without having a doctorso how can i answer that it would be like playing a guessing game but guess in life it goes both ways
0.560000	I dont completely trust any doctor simply because they get paid to treat sick people and so sometimes i feel they prescribe medications to prolong symptoms or treatment in order to make more money off their patients.
1.000000	My doctor listens to me and explains test results clearly. If I have any questions he takes the time to answer them. He doesn't rush through anything.
0.720000	My doctor is pretty straight forward is sensitive but to the point.  I must trust he only has my best interest at heart
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for many years through everything I have been through if she didn't know the answer she would always ask for help or investigate to get the answer I have never had any problems with her judgement or decision.
1.000000	Been with my doctor for many years. When he thought something on my leg looked like could be skin cancer, he didn't wait, he called a dermatologist right away and sent me right over to have it checked.  Sure enough it was skin cancer.
0.600000	I trust my primary doctor to a certain extent sometimes worry that they choose prescriptions thru firms that they get something from so push that companies pills
0.960000	I recently switched physicians and have found a truly remarkable one who actually listens to me and works with me
1.000000	I love my dr. because she is open to hearing what I have to say and is not interested in bossing me or just telling me something to get me out of her hair.
0.760000	I mostly trust my doctors because they know way more about the medical field than me.  However, doctors can definitely be wrong, which is why I didn't rate the statements above as 5.  Also, there can be some doctors that don't always want what is best for their patient, especially if it would cause too much of an inconvenience to themselves.
0.760000	I mostly trust my primary provider. I feel that she has my best interests in mind and provides good care. However, I wouldn't fully trust any single human with serious health decisions. I have a need to research things myself, and even though I know my doctor is a good one, she's human, and we all make mistakes. 
0.880000	do not have a primary doctor, but I feel that doctors are desensitized to the health concerns of their patients
0.960000	I am able to reach my  physician by e mail or phone and get a reply back in a timely manner if it is needed. They are helpful in keeping any RX's refilled and providing me with the results of my tests along with any recommendations. 
0.720000	I know he does what is good for me hes been in practice for years sometimes he does things weird but in the end he is right
1.000000	She makes sure she has all the current information before making a diagnosis. I am very happy with my doctor.
0.800000	I have a regular physician at the university hospital. I have been seeing him for past few years. So far, I do not have any issues with. During my visit, he is always very professional. He seems to care a lot about patients. He is always polite, kind and caring. He seems very focused during the diagnosis. After careful examination, he has been able to explain my problems in simple words and recommend the proper treatment. He always warns about possible side effects of any prescription.  So, far I have not had any issues with treatment and medicines. That is why I trust my physician very much. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor , If I distrust my doctor I will replaced him. I think he take care about my health
0.960000	They are always honest and polite explain it so that I understand it im very happy with my doctors. They are very trusting nice and not rude
0.800000	I have had the same primary care physician for over twenty years. He has shown that he intends nothing but the best over the years. I've been able to see his professiolism and he even keeps extra tabs on me to see if I am doing well.
0.800000	I trust them because they have more knowledge and experience to handle my problems based on their training and hands on experience.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because she seems knowledgable and trustworthy so far. ive only been to her oncce though so we will see
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He's never led me wrong so far.
0.880000	"I mostly trust my primary care physician because he is usually right when deciding what is wrong with me. But I do have doubt's wondering if he is always right when deciding what is wrong with me because he has said in the past, ""Try this medicine to see if it goes away and if it's still the same come back."" It makes me wonder if the physician knows what they are doing and if he will be able to help the next time I am sick and know what is wrong with me."
1.000000	I have had my doctor for a long time. He seems my entire family and children. He is kind and patient. Makes sure you understand everything and does not rush with you.
1.000000	The reason that I feel like I am totally able to trust my doctor is because they are a certified physician that has successfully treated me for years.                        .
0.800000	I feel like he has been honest and forthcoming with me.  I went in with questions and I expected him to have answers, because when I chose him, we had a similar outlook about the prescription drug epidemic in America.  That being said, I asked about different vitamins and supplements, since I'd heard a lot of them are unnecessary.  Not only did he tell me which ones I need, but the amounts, which was hugely helpful
0.720000	I don't have a whole of interaction with my primary doc (barely a checkup a year), and not many problems (yet), so there's nothing really controversial I wouldn't trust about her diagnoses and prescriptions. Sometimes she does miss items in my history and wanted to prescribe something that wouldn't be a good idea, but I point this out.
0.840000	My doctor listens well. He all test needed. Though I think he may have to many patients. At times I feel rushed.
0.440000	I have migraines. My former pain management doctor gave me botox injections. I also got occipital nerve blocks for a different headache. My new doctor (moved to a new state) told me nobody is trained to do that. He didn't offer any type of option. He doesn't care. I don't trust him with my care for that reason.
0.720000	i respect them because they help me alot concerning my health.they  do tell me reality whenever i visit them and they give me advices about coping with life experiences. through them,i have a sense of belonging even when i tend to feel that my life is meaningless
0.800000	I generally trust doctors, their abilities, and intentions. My only source of distrust would come from them seeming too busy or distracted and making mistakes.
0.840000	My primary care physician is thoughtful and absolutely does his best to give good advice.  At the end of the day, though, medical decisions are my decision, and  I need to do my own thinking and research about serious conditions.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has never made a bad medical decision, and he listens to my problems ad concerns
0.720000	My primary case physician spends a lot of time with me and any issues I have are probably due to my inability to communicate my issues to him effectively.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he helps me with all my questions. He seems  trustworthy and i am sure there isnt any untrustworthy physicians, they are all meant to be trustwrthy.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because, she always seems to have my best interest at heart when every i go to see my doctor for something she always go in to deep questioning into what is the problems i am having, and when she prescribe a diagnosis and or medication she always take the time explain everything i needs to know she never rushes with her patients. 
0.680000	It is not that I do not trust my doctor, however, I am aware that my doctor is only trained in western medicine. I am open to remedies and treatments that western medicine may not be knowledgeable about or have believe works. I know that my doctor is limited due to their training. 
0.640000	Right now, I have a very good doctor. She takes the time to explain everything. I never feel rushed and in the way. She make me fill like she cares.
0.640000	I don't know if you are not the intended addressee please notify the system is not important also with the group chat with you and I will be deleted on my phone
0.680000	I feel good about my primary care doctor because I've been seeing her for a while and she's helped me several times when sick or feeling depressed, etc. but I don't have the same good feelings about most doctors in general. 
0.840000	most doctors are in it because of the money and don't the job as serious and mature like they should be
0.560000	He's a nice guy, but I don't think he weighs all the options. I have been diagnosed wrong a few times, so I have less confidence in him now.
0.760000	When a doctor shows interest in what I have to say and gives advices relevant to my needs, it helps build trust.
0.480000	I feel some doctors don't know what there doing. I would like someone who is experienced or at least able to explain to me what i am taking
0.840000	My Dr. seems to be pretty open with me in regards to my medical care. He gives me options pertaining to medications
0.680000	I trust medical professiols except in the rare instances where I know more than they do. That's scarily common in mental health fields, especially.
0.600000	She does a good job in keeping up with my care and treatment. I feel comfortable in confiding in her with all my problems and medical needs.
0.680000	I do not trust my primary care physician for many different reasons. First off, I believe he prescribes medication for even the smallest symptoms. This is usually not necessary, and most of the time just gives a financial burden. I also believe that they don't fully check your symptoms to check if it is something more severe, and rather just plays it off like its the flu and that it'll go away after a while. 
0.280000	I do not trust any doctor I have seen because all they do is ignore you and always write a prescription just to get you out of there office so they do not have to listen to anything your saying.
0.840000	Whenever I have had a question about my care, my doctor has always been forthcoming and honest about potential treatment plans and side-effects to prescribed medication.  
0.480000	Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I never put full trust in doctor's because they are human. They don't know everything and I always question.
0.640000	Their willingness to explain my medical diagnosis thoroughly, but in understanding terms makes me trust my pcp. 
0.600000	Cause there's no guarantee in what a physician tells you about your state of health and also rely on yourself to take of a health matter that is important to a cause or effect to see how a health matter is a concern to a individual in certain situations.
0.960000	My primary care physician is a very nice young woman and I have been to her several times over the past years.  She has always told me what is necessary and I have never sensed any dishonesty in speaking with her.  She has told me the truth about everything I have asked about. She also listens to what I told her I thought was the problem.  She has agreed with me on many occasions. She has referred me to another physician when she thought it was beyond her scope.  I have asked for prescriptions that I felt would be necessary for me and she has complied and agreed with me.  She is young and I feel she has the most current knowledge possible.  I have never looked at her as inexperienced.  She has always presented herself very professiol and she presents herself as very knowledgeable.  In conversations with her, she IS actually knowledgeable.

0.320000	"The doctor's clinic I go to often wants to run a bunch of tests which I think are often unnecessary. And because my insurance isn't that great, I end up paying thousands of dollars. Last year I had to pay $600 for a lyme disease test that my dr. thought I should get because I garden a lot. Every single time I go, a $40.00 charge for 'smoking counseling' shows up on my bill. But it is literally a five second conversation of ""You smoke?"" and me saying yes and the doctor saying ""you should quite"". No joke, nothing more than that 5 second sentence and they charge 40.00. I think it is a huge scam. "
0.720000	You  choose your doctor and put your faith in them.  If your relationship does not have trust, it will never last. That does not exclude, however, sometimes questioning your doctors decisions.  For that reason, it is important to have a place where you can always get a second opinion. 
0.600000	well, you baited a lot of negative opinions about primary care. Also, I have issue with your question which assumes that primary care is bad. It's not. People like it. It can make you a comfortable living, and can be extremely rewarding just like any other specialty.
0.520000	I have been given a new doctor recently who've only been to once.  Therefore, It is difficult to judge how much I can trust them.  The majority of the time spent is sitting with a nurse.

0.640000	I do not have a primary care physician as I rarely need a doctor and if I do, it is for something specialized (kidneys). In general cases, I trust doctors and believe they give me credible, appropriate information but I'm not willing to completely believe everything.

0.760000	i do not really have much to say about it after all medical treatment is not an option its a nicesity
0.680000	It isn't so much that i distrust my Dr. the individual, but rather i distrust the system. The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM.

0.720000	I like my primary care physician but I must be cautious. Although my doctor cares for his patients' well-being, he does seem to push prescriptions rather than talking about potential altertives.

0.760000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she has been my doctor for a long time. I trust what she has to say as she has not given me any reason to not trust her yet.
0.240000	My doctor is a internist and cardiologist; and he spends little time with patients.  He quickly prescribes drugs; and claims diet and exercise won't help alleviate medical conditions.
