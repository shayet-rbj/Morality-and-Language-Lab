0.760000	Sometimes they are in a hurry to get to the next patient and make quick, sp judgments that do not apply.  Sometimes they are much more interested in what insurance plan you have than your well being.
0.600000	I feel that my primary care physician is adequate. He does listen and try to help with my medical issues. However he also refuses to try new procedures and treatments that might help me.
0.680000	With my PCP, there has been a long relationship, he know my needs/wants and is able to accommodate them in most instances. If I did not trust my PCP, I would get a different one. 
0.520000	I trust them that they think they are doing the right thing. What worries me is what they could be doing wrong.
0.760000	Well he knows what is best. I'm sure he doesn't want to get sued for doing something wrong. He wants to do the best he can do. 
0.920000	My primary care physician was able to correctly diagnose a rare inner ear condition that I have.
0.640000	Some doctors are in it for the money
0.720000	I'm still alive!  He must be doing something right.
0.680000	I think my doctor is generally trustworthy.  I wonder sometimes with the things he says if he is pushing me to get on drugs because he wants to write RX for those types of drugs.
0.360000	Doctors are human, they are arrogant and used to getting their own way, they are inclined to listen to the powers that be instead of to their patients, and they are often lapdogs for the pharmaceutical industry.
0.840000	He has been our family physician forever, I trust him to make decisions that positively affect our family. 
0.880000	They're busy and tired, but they have guidelines and responsibilities to give me the best care for me. They didn't waste all that time in school and during their career to give me poor treatment. I trust them.
0.600000	I don't really have an opinion of most doctors. Some are good and some are shitty.
0.720000	My doctor listens and allows me to complete my sentences (doesn't interrupt). My doctor asks me pertinent questions.
0.760000	Because I do feel that sometimes doctors pushes way to much medicines
0.480000	I trust my family doctor greatly. I've been using him since I was a teenager. I never had a problem with him.
0.720000	I do trust Docs but they also are human and can be moody, high strung and sometimes jackasses
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician.  I have been seeing her for 17 years so I completely trust her as a doctor. 
0.600000	I distrust my primary physician because all you here these days are how people are being prescribed things that they don't need 
0.720000	My doctor tends to diagnose most problems as the same thing so I don't always agree with all he says.
0.560000	I trust them to an extent. However, they are human, they make mistakes and they can't always devote full attention to every patient.
0.960000	I trust my Doctor because I have been with them for a long time. They have always gave me accurate information and diagnosed problems with relative ease. I have never had an issue that resulted from any decision they have made regarding my plan of care.
0.520000	Just started seeing this doctor and they harp on and on about needing to lose weight.  I get the feeling that they would blame any issue I'm having on my weight and not want to investigate further.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician when we talk about what could be wrong, and early treatments.  However I always go online and take a look about what I can find and see what other options are.  I know that the health system is not perfect, and I try to minimize doing anything unnecessary.
0.640000	I do not know my physician well enough because I do not visit him very frequently. I also do not trust people too much to begin with.
0.520000	I feel that they generally are trying to rush you out of the office and don't really care that much.
0.600000	I've only seen my doctor once for a physical and she seemed a little dismissive of my concerns. I was told by a different doctor I may have a condition that requires a simple blood test but she stated that it was unnecessary and ignored my symptoms. 
0.440000	It's not necessarily that I don't trust my doctor but  I think she's far too rushed for such a serious matter. She is very casual and nonchalant about things that are of great importance to my life. She brushes off side effects/symptoms as if they are normal every day things but then puts me on medication to alter them and brings up having to have heart surgery. I am getting mixed messages and it makes me unsure of the severity or what she is thinking about course of treatment.
0.720000	I trust my physician to a point. The only thing I don't like is getting my blood pressure taken, and then I don't get told immediately what it is. I need to have this information.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him
0.520000	I trust them because I have been with them since I was a kid. However, their practices seem a little bit outdated compared to others.
1.000000	I have been going to the same doctor for 40 years.  I completely think he understands me and has my best interests in mind.
0.600000	Overall I have slight trust in the medical world. I think my doctor is persuaded by large pharma companies and I think a lot of the times they do things that are easier or make more money.
0.720000	They have gotten prominent degrees and I have good reason to trust them.
0.880000	I trust my PCP because she paid attention to the fact that I had a goiter, when no one else would, and she's treating my hypothyroidism, when no one else took it seriously.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because it seems he always has my best interests in mind. He doesn't lie to me as far as I know. He also doesn't just push medication on me, he tries to understand what I actually need.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have a long relationship with her, she has shown me that she is capable. She has helped me many times.
0.400000	I haven't had a lot of experience with my new doctor that would allow me to build a proper relationship.
0.520000	I view them more of a guide than an expert on everything. For more common occurrences, I believe he has his way of doing things, which isn't necessarily the only way or even the best way. 
0.840000	In general, my primary care physician has been a very good fit for me.  He does work in a very busy practice, so I can imagine that he might overlook something in my care, but I have not seen him do so in my dealings with him.
0.800000	The first time I went to see my primary care physician he spent a lot of time with me getting to know about my problems. He sat down, looked concerned, and wanted to know more information so that he could help me. He also listens to me when I have a different medication request and he is very easy to work with.
0.400000	I don't really trust or distrust him, I am kind of ambivalent about him.  He seems perfectly nice but he's usually in quite a rush and makes me feel like I'm a hassle just for being there sometimes.  I don't like that he doesn't remember or check information in my chart, especially since it's a small practice and I've been there for years.  If I'm in for strep throat or something, he always tries to prescribe a medicine I'm allergic to and his nurse has to stop him.
0.760000	I have been to him for over a decade as has my spouse. He is a great doctor
0.680000	I usually trust my doctor. Sometimes when he is rushed he doesn't give me the attention I ask for. For example, I had concerns over side effects from medication and he was in a hurry so shrugged it off. 
0.720000	I feel my doctor is knowledgeable and genially concerned with my health and well being. He is a caring person and isn't worried about how much money he can make.
0.720000	I have gone to him for several years.   he takes time to listen and gives useful feedback.   
0.720000	Not a special reason
0.840000	I have built up trust with my doctor because I know that they are being honest with me. I have been going to them for a long time and they always seem to have my better care in mind.
0.600000	I'm not crazy about him, but I'm on Medicaid and few good doctors. take it.
0.560000	I trust that my doctor is doing the best he can. I think he is rushed and overworked though and perhaps could just miss things in haste. 
0.640000	I trust my doctor's motives; I don't think his knowledge is always complete.  I live in a relatively small town and use a primary-care physician simply to order things like routine cholesterol screenings, and perhaps as a first source of information about things I can't figure out myself. If I had a significant medical problem, I would try to drive somewhere else and see a specialist.
0.400000	My primary care physician is not interested in my care.  He just wants me in and out so he can get to the next patient or have sometime off in between patients.  He only ever tells me one option even if I ask for another option he will just tell me the first option was better.
0.400000	They work for a business just like anyone else. You can't trust them more than you trust any salesman.
0.520000	I really want to trust my doctor but I think we have gotten away from the family physician model and now we just see anyone.  And each doctor is different so you basically always start over at square one each visit
0.440000	I don't trust doctors in general because most of them don't take their own advice on eating/exercise. Most of them also just flat out laugh in your face when you decide to take control over what happens to your body and just don't follow their instructions blindly. Doctors that I have been to in the past have been pushy for me to get certain shots or things that I have researched and decided I don't want. 
0.200000	"Doctors are only out to make as much money as possible. There should never be a time when you make an appointment at a doctors and have to wait a month to see them or be told to go to the ER ""if"" it's an emergency. Doctors should have patient CAPS and all doctors should be required to take all insurances. Also a doctor should never have so many appointments that you see their nurses aid instead of them."
0.400000	They tend to go for the easiest and quickest solution possible so they can see as many patients a day as possible. They are not after helping people, they are after making money.
0.960000	My doctor will always lay out several options if I have a problem and she will go over all of them with me and tell me the pluses and minuses to each one and then she will help me to make the best choice for what I need and if she disagrees with something I have chosen she will tell me why and then say what she thinks would be a better choice
0.640000	I trust my PCP to an extent, but my full confidence and faith does not rely on man--but on my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
0.600000	I don't distrust my physician. However, they are often rushed to get to the next patient so I don't always trust that they are being as thorough as possible.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest with me. If I had any problem in the past he always told me my options and explained the consequences. 
1.000000	I know him personally so I know he'd tell the truth
0.400000	I don't trust them anymore. I will go to the Emergency room if I have to but the doctors where I live are all foreign. The nurses in the hospital are all from Haiti. I live near 33460 and we have tons of illegals and foreign people here. They don't seem to care as much about quality of care, like I had growing up in Alabama.
1.000000	She has never lied or led me in the wrong direction.
0.800000	Because they take a medical oath and have ethics that they have to follow. It's not about what they want to do, its about what's right and what's wrong. They have always looked out for my interest in health care and are not subjective or bias.
0.840000	I feel my doctor explains his decisions fully and gives me the opportunity to take part in the process. I feel he is intelligent and I have no reason not to trust him.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because the information he has provided has been accurate and in line with any additional testing I have had done. 
0.240000	I don't trust them. They've screwed up before.
0.720000	They have always been open and honest and answer all my questions throuhgly
0.800000	I really like my primary care physician. He is never in a rush with even though he may be busy with patients. I ask a lot of questions and he always answers them. He gives me his thoughts but allows for me to make my decision on my own
0.640000	He is very young but seems to be engaged with his patients 
0.560000	I don't know if I trust doctor's in general, I feel that they may be only looking out for themselves, but I can't pinpoint why. It's probably just distrust for that type in general.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He has never led me wrong so far.
0.800000	I have just never had any problems. I've been seeing the same doctor for years and years. I feel like there is no reason to not trust her.
0.440000	I distrust because Dr's are human too.
0.720000	My doctor takes time to listen and try to explain things to me.  She seems very thorough in here assessment of my situations and has not steered me wrong yet in health decisions.
0.480000	I have a tumor in my jaw and there are treatments out there for it, but it seems like the surgeons try to persuade me to have surgery without being open to other options. Only one has told me about other options.
0.280000	i DONT THINK SHE HAS TIME TO LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS. SHE ONLY WANTS TO TREAT ONE LITTLE THING WHEN i THINK THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. SHE GIVES MEDS TO QUICKLY
0.760000	I trust them to do their job. They have the knowledge and hopefully the honesty to do it correctly
0.960000	My doctor takes the time to sit with me and make sure I understand what he is saying.  He has day with me doing research on medication and takes my opinion seriously. 
0.640000	At times, non-traditiol treatment options may be overlooked or undervalued depending on a doctor's experience and history, when altertive options paired with modern medicine can find a useful balance.
0.720000	I have not had any problems with my doctor. The only thing i don't trust or have a problem with is when i think something needs to be checked or im worried about someone it is brushed off and not taken seriously.
0.760000	I trust her because I have know her for years and she is very approachable and friendly. She is willing to be honest and frank with me, even if the truth hurts.
0.720000	I have been seeing the same primary for years, since I was a teeger. He delivered my oldest daughter and he has always been forthcoming.  He is also the primary for most of the women in my family and has always been wonderful to all of us.
1.000000	I really trust her because she listens to me and takes my views and opinions into account. She also is very smart and thinks out loud with me about options to address my concerns rather than just deciding on an option for me.
0.760000	Most doctors really want to help. Though there might be some out there that don't want to help. Those are the kind that are in it for the money. But most doctors can be trusted
0.640000	He's fine.  I generally trust him or I wouldn't go to him. He's honest but that doesn't mean he knows everything or is up to date on the latest treatments.  He's not afraid to refer me to a specialist, which I appreciate.
0.800000	My physician seems concerned about my health. She is willing to talk to me and takes my concerns into consideration.
0.520000	"I just sometimes feel that my doctor and doctors in general are in a rush. They do what they always do to treat certain problems. If their treatment doesn't work, then ""oh well."" I've had several medical issues that I've gone to doctors for over and over and I just don't get any real concern or any improvement. No persol care, so I just don't have a high level of trust."
0.840000	I have been seeing the same primary care doctor since I was a child. I have complete faith in my doctor and will always take his suggestions and recommendations to heart.
0.600000	I THINK HE IS A GOOD DR. HE TRIES VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO ME AND HELP ME OUT. WE ALSO TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO HIM. HE IS VERY THOUROGH
0.720000	I trust them because of their experiences and knowledge 
0.840000	Basically if I or my family have complaint about our health we will go to our family doctor. We trust our family doctor, if he ask us to see specialist we will do.
0.840000	My doctor can relate to me and anybody else for that matter. She listens to me and my concerns and make sure that I have little to no worries. 
0.640000	I trust them for the most part but they do seem to make sp judgements and not to go in depth as i would like
0.800000	My physician has helped me every time I had a problem. She has given me the right treatments and made me feel better. I have no reason not to trust her at this point.
1.000000	I trust my doctors because every time I had a problem with my health she steered me in the right direction 
1.000000	She is knowledgeable and up to date on the latest research. She is caring and attentive as well. 
0.920000	This doctor is a colleague and friend of the family. He was once my pediatrician and pediatrician to my younger sister that is now 25. He is also the pediatrician to my children as well. I can always go to him for a second opinion if needed. 
0.760000	I would suspect that a doctor that is engaging in activities that would lead to people questioning their legitimacy in their decisions wouldn't still be able to be a physician. All my physicians that I've ever had seemed to genuinely care about wanting to treat patients to the best of their abilities.
0.920000	I trust them with my care. They know more medical stuff than I do. It would be crazy not to trust them.
0.840000	I have been given no reason not to trust her. She always has good advice and doesn't push pills as the fix for something.
0.840000	Because he saved my life. He was very good indiagnosing my illness.
1.000000	They've never given me a reason to not trust them.
0.760000	I have been seeing them for many years.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he knows a lot more than me. He has vast experience, I have none.
0.200000	They are in it for the money. They do not actually care.
0.960000	I have been with my doctor long enough for him to know my history. I think he always chooses the best path for me and we work together on long term plans for health. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he has a good education and asks me plenty of questions. I have never had a problem with him.
0.480000	Doctors are human, Some are qualified/competent, some are incompetent. Some put patient care over money, some put money over care, etc. I wouldn't blindly trust anyone for anything without doing some reasearch on my own, getting a second opinion if necessary, and considering the facts myself. 
0.760000	My physician has helped me in positive ways thus far, but I never like to put my complete trust in anyone because you just never know. 
0.560000	I don't really trust my primary care physician because he doesn't tend to remember information from visit to visit and he seems quick to throw a medication at any complaint without considering other options.
0.760000	i trust them because i have used them for years and they have no reason to be dishonest to me
0.520000	I feel about average about these things. I think there are goo physicians but I also think some don't take things seriously. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has always done right by me. He answers all my questions and listens to my concerns.
0.920000	My doctor has always been very honest about everything...even if I might not want to hear it.  I feel like we have good, honest conversation and I feel comfortable discussing anything with him.
0.800000	my doctor have decades of experience and it great at treating me correctly and with the right medication
0.840000	I think they have the knowledge to know what is wrong and it seems reasoble about what they are telling me. I see no reason to distrust them until they prove me wrong.
0.880000	I'm not an expert. I defer to my doctor because they are far more qualified to tell me about my health than I am. 
0.440000	I distrust my primary care physician because she is always in a rush and in a hurry and basically often ignores what I am concerned about by brushing it off as no big deal. She often pushes medications as well when I make it clear that I do not want to use medicine as a first resort.
0.760000	My primary PCP is awesome. She answers all my questions, takes time with me and knows me and my family. I trust them. 
0.840000	I believe that doctors enter the profession because they want to help people. It would be unethical for them to mislead their patients. 
0.760000	Overall, I do have some base trust in doctors. I recognize their position, and what it would take for them to make it there. Obviously, they've gone through extensive schooling and are well experienced. Thus, I should at minimum, respect their opinions and strongly consider them.
0.640000	While I do think that they can sometimes be thorough and careful, I do believe that sometimes it's only to fit their hypotheses. I don't firmly stand by that, but I do believe some just want to get patients in and out without so much as a second appointment or a scheduling more exams. 
0.680000	My doctor wants to give his all, but the time crunch between patients can make it difficult for him.  
0.840000	I really like my current doctor.  He's younger than me, which is a little weird, but he is very open minded, more so than me.  He always gives me different  altertives  on how to treat myself 
0.880000	We have a great relationship where he fields my questions appropriately. He also understands my background when giving explations.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because they always walk me through all of my options with any issue I may be having. I never feel pushed into taking medicine or doing something I am not comfortable with. They answer all my questions and make me feel secure and knowledgeable in my health choices.
0.320000	I HAVE NO REASON TO TRUST MY DOCTOR. HE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN HIS BOTTOM LINE. I NEED TO CHANGE DOCTORS
0.920000	My doctor has always given me a real prognosis and I appreciate that. My clinical doctor has always checked my neck and given me through physicals to make me feel at ease. Any bumps or pains are always checked, and he makes me feel comfortable. 
0.280000	Primary care physicians literally couldn't care less about what you have to say or the symptoms you have. They only care about the blood work. They want you in and out as fast as possible. Primary care physicians live to get off at 5. 
0.720000	I trust my current PCP very much! I had very negative experience with a previous PCP who didn't want to take on my complicated medical history, but I am currently very lucky.
0.800000	I've been going to my primary care doctor for years and she hasn't given me any reason to not trust her.  To the contrary, she lets me know that she is going to do what she thinks should be done, regardless if I like it or not.
0.720000	My doctor has never tried to push any medications on me. He is more likely to send me home and tell me to give it a few days than he is to prescribe a treatment. He's a no nonsense kind of guy.
0.440000	Because medical knowledge is still limited but doctors seem to think they have fil solutions, when in fact a lot of medicine is still trial and error. 
0.640000	I wouldn't have complete trust in anyone over decisions regarding my health.  I think it's important to verify things and get second opinions to make sure I have as much information as possible.
0.680000	I trust my primary physician because he has always given me good advice and never steered me wrong 
0.680000	Ultimately, I trust my primary care physician. He has more knowledge than I do and a medical degree, so I will trust him or get a second opinion if it were a really big deal.
0.480000	I feel that most doctors are there to meet their bottom line.  They care more about the money they can make than the people that they see.  
0.600000	I don't trust them because they have god complex.  I don't trust them because they think better of themselves.
0.720000	I trust doctors in general because they have a deeper understanding of the things I don't know about my body.  For example, I have chronic heartburn and I trust that my doctor can share information about which treatment is best for me.
0.760000	I trust her because she never seems in a rush and always has time for my questions or concerns.  She does not just shove a drug at me and send me on my way.
0.560000	I don't really have a primary at the moment. For doctors in general, I feel as if some of them are good and some of them are bad. Some are only interested in themselves and making money and other actually care. Its a toss up. 
0.480000	I don't completely trust my doctor because I know that insurance plays into this. Some things just don't get approved so they have to tell me different stuff. Also their persol beliefs play in so I know they  may not be honest with me at times.
1.000000	He's always taken the time to explain things about my care thoroughly to me and without complaining. He seems to genuinely care about my health.
0.400000	I went to them and told them I believe I had something, they brushed me off and said I was fine. Four visits and hundreds of dollars later I was diagnosed with that very thing and then was given a treatment that did not work.
0.640000	I trust the doctors because they have been in the field and schooling for a long period of time.  I do struggle with them telling me what is convenient for them and what is best for me. 
0.920000	I have been going to him for a while and he is great.  He actually listens to you and you can tell he really cares
0.440000	"I think he is too focused on certain health issues (my weight) and not focused enough on the things that are causing me to have poor quality of life (chronic migraine, chronic pain from arthritis) even though my poor quality of life is a major factor in why I am overweight - because I'm uble to exercise without pain, I have no energy to cook healthy food, etc. etc. But people don't like ""fat chicks"" and doctors always seem to focus on that as a #1 problem no matter what. "
0.800000	He works in a small town and is well-known in the community. He has a high reputation to uphold. 
0.760000	I just started with a new doctor, and she is young and persoble. She listens intently, asks me about my choices, and offers a variety of possible treatment plans. I greatly appreciate that after my previous doctor, who was nice but more interested in pushing supplements she had a fincial interest in.
0.760000	Its not that I don't trust in what they're saying to me, I just have to realize that they may not always be right, and with a serious diagnosis I would definitly seek a second opinion and move from there
0.520000	My primary care physician waves off my chronic health concerns and pretending my chronic stomach issues are normal or not a cause for concern even though I see them as very serious and suffer because of them.
1.000000	I have been going to the same doctor for years now in a great clinic my kids and wife go to as well.  We really like it there and it eels like a whole team of care rather then one doctor.  
0.840000	My GP knows more about medicine than I do and the only way diagnosis and treatment will work is if I participate and do my best as a patient.
0.800000	I trust doctors in general because I grew up around them, and saw that almost all of them were there to help people. I don't believe any of them would suggest a treatment for any other reason than it being the best thing for the patient at that time.
0.800000	My newest doctor is very good.  He takes the time with me to sit in the office after my physical and address any concerns.  This is the first time I have had a doctor that takes enough time with me.  I really do trust him and he explains things to me thoroughly
0.600000	I don't completely trust Western medicine and only seek it out when it is absolutely necessary.  I don't always trust the doctor's information especially when they just want to prescribe a pill to mask symptoms and not really deal with the core of the problem.  I take everything my doctors say with a grain of salt.
0.800000	I trust them for the most part. I feel that he doesn't have all the expertise I need for my different conditions though.
0.600000	I think that sometimes the doctor is not listening to my concerns and is just giving me text book or generic answers.
0.640000	I am very new to my provider. She came highly recommended and I felt comfortable the few times I have seen her. But I have not had to use her for anything more than basic check ups.
0.800000	m\My primary care doctor has been seeing my family for many years. he always makes time to call and check in if one of us is very ill and makes us feel like he is doing his best to put our health first 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she was someone my mom trusted. My mom had her for years and later recommended her to me. She was instrumental in referring my mom to a doctor who diagnosed her as BRCA1+. So we ended up trusting her. My mom has since passed from BRCA1+-related cancer, but this doctor even called her after my mom was termil, just to say hello and see how she was doing.
0.840000	I have been going to my primary care physician for a long time now, so I understand his methods and we have a relationship. He knows my habits and health concerns, and he never hesitates to tell me the good and the bad. He let me see the reports and exam results so I can see for myself what is happening, and he'll answer any questions I have. 
0.800000	I have been going to this Doctor since I was a young boy and he has taken amazingly good care of me and my family.  He is also a member of my church and we know his family.  He has fully earned my trust and respect.
0.680000	
0.480000	Doctors seem to often be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. I feel like they don't ask me enough questions. I feel like they don't take the time to fully and accurately diagnose me.
0.440000	Doctors these days are money motivated and are paid by the system. It's rigged to get people on prescriptions that kill you!
0.640000	I mostly trust my PCP, but I do feel like she's a little old.  I think it's worth getting a second opinion when anything serious comes up. However, for general run of the mill problems, I think she's fine. 
0.520000	i distruct my primary care physcian because i see a different person each time. I never have someone who knows me. I'm always explaining things. It's like im a car and the mechanic is different each time.
0.600000	Everyone is different. Some are better than others.
0.280000	I have been to my doctor, been waiting in the waiting room and seen him talking to a friend. When my doctor notices that he has patient's waiting he gets angry and tells them they could look for other doctors.  I also don't trust him as he does not do thorough exams.  He simply refills my prescription every year without checking anything.
0.800000	I think they want to help people .That's what they went to school and training for. So, I trust that they know what they're doing and can make the best decisions.
0.800000	I have been going to my PCP for over 10 years.  She is always happy to see me, and takes all the time that I need.  Every decision she makes has been the right one.  She has so much experience and makes me feel well cared for. 
0.760000	My primary is very knowledgeable and listens to what my concerns are, I feel very comfortable trusting him.
0.640000	I trust my physician.  They are licensed and educated
0.800000	My doctor seems straightforward and trustworthy. I feel no reason to doubt him.
0.600000	I trust her because she is the one who is looking over my health. I myself have to as well, but she knows the ins and outs of hte human body and what is good and not good.
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor because she has also been my parents' doctor for a long time, so I can trust her. 
0.720000	I have been seeing my dr for a long time and she knows me pretty well.
0.800000	I trust doctors in general because of my experiences in the past. There are good and bad doctors, but I believe that overall they are trustworthy. 
0.800000	I've had the same physician for years now. So,  he has gained my trust.
1.000000	My doctor takes my concerns seriously. In fact, I had a problem with itching during my pregncy. The nurse line told me that it was in my head and to just deal with it. When I mentioned it to my doctor, she immediately ran tests and diagnosed me with a condition that required me to be induced right away, as it could have resulted in my baby being stillborn. The fact that she took my concerns seriously over something as small as itchy hands and feet shows she cares.
0.640000	I don't think I have seen my primary care physician enough to establish more trust.  I have only seen her once, so most of my answers are based off experiences that I have had with doctors in general, mostly OBs.
0.560000	It is mostly about making money in the grand scheme of things so it makes it hard to trust. I know that some are there to help people, but it doesn't help the corporate mindset of it in the long run. I wish I trusted my doctors more but sometimes you even question the diagnosis of some conditions.
0.640000	I know they have the knowledge, but they also deal with so many patients on a daily basis, that I feel like they can get careless and annoyed easier because of that. I worry they don't care as much as they should.
0.800000	She is laid back and doesn't get worked up about stuff that isn't important.  She let's me know to relax and not worry. 
0.800000	My doctor is a straight-forward guy.  I believe that he tells me like it is.  I know that he's very good at his job.  I have confidence in him.
0.600000	The last time I visited my primary care physician, I felt they were a bit distant and basically told me to put ice on a foot injury, then walked away. Was kinda weird. Seemed like they wanted to leave.
0.800000	I have been going to my primary care doctor for many years so I have built trust in him. He encourages questions and is great at asking what I think because he says I know my body better than he ever could. His confidence in me and listening skills are what really make me trust him. 
0.800000	My doctors have always been the type of people to relay a sense of trust. Not only in their ability to explain what is happening to me, but in their demeanor.
0.760000	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind. At the end of the day he will do whats best for me even if it causes him an inconvenience 
0.840000	I've never had her judge me and she's very thorough in explaining why she things this medicine or htis procedure should be done and won't do anything unless I absolutely understand what is going on.
0.880000	He is someone who is honest. When I have a question, I dont hesitate to ask and he is clear with his answers. 
0.480000	I think that my doctor and doctors in general face a number of pressure outside of being an advocate for best outcomes for me. Furthermore I do not trust the expertise of only one person in any situation. This means that if I feel something is serious I look for a different opinions and research the issue myself. I also feel that doctors are often unwilling to address my concerns to satisfaction due to time constraints, so this makes me feel that I ought not to trust them compeletly. 
0.400000	My most recent primary care physician was very dismissive of my needs, did not inform me of the seriousness of my condition, and overall did not spend the requisite time with me to inform me of my condition. I am still living with the relevant condition as a result. 
0.600000	I trust them because obviously they must be doing something right to be in business
0.760000	My primary care physician has known me for majority of my life and is very thorough about what needs to be done about my medical needs.
0.720000	DOCTORS ARE LIKE GOD
0.560000	I trust him because I have been with him for so long. I know he is looking for my best interest.
0.320000	It's my life, it's not my doctor's life. It's his job. Even if he has every intention of doing the best by me, that doesn't mean he's capable or doing that does it. Doctor's don't know everything, and it's my body and health and I have to live with it.
0.760000	I just switched to a new PCP after a move. I have a very pleasant visit with my new doctor and I felt he was honest, listened to my concerns and friendly. 
0.760000	My doctor is highly trained and highly regarded in the community.  I am comfortable with him and my treatment plans and therefore trust him.  He is highly rated.
0.760000	"In general, I trust doctors. In the area where I live we have a good selection of doctors and health professiols to choose from so it is in their best interest to provide quality health care.  With the abundance of information available on the internet, people often use that information to get a ""second opinion"" of what doctors tell them as well."
1.000000	My doctor seems very knowledgeable in his field. He takes time and doesn't rush. Not glued to his laptop. So far he has been right with any diagnosis.
0.640000	I think my doctors take the time to answer questions but also try to make sure I have the most options covered.
0.640000	I believe that they generally have the best interest of other people in mind, and do not want people to suffer. 
0.680000	Well, I just met my new doctor not too long ago, and I believe he's wrong on some points, but I don't believe it's out of trying to hide things from me.  I think he just believes every last thing that he was taught, and does not alter from that reality.
0.680000	I feel like doctors usually try to do what is best but sometimes they are really busy. Also, sometimes they might recommend a certain treatment because they might get a kickback from a drug company.
0.720000	She is easily distracted by other things it seems.
0.440000	I normally distrust them. They love to hurry my along and don't seem like they're really listening to me. They just rather get me in-and-out quick to make fast money. I always leave there disappointed in them.
0.600000	I trust my doctor will listen and provide adequate care. However sometimes i feel like they need pushing in the right direction or motivation to provide the care. Sometimes I think it's easier for them to avoid a situation so they don't have to deal with it.
0.600000	I trust them to an extent but I don't have a very strong relationship with them and in general I'm a little suspicious of medical professiols.  I think they withhold some information from patients.  Plus I've had them tell me the wrong things before, things I knew were not true because I had found research conflicting it, so I sometimes just don't trust them.
0.400000	I dont disturst him, but I also dont completely trust him..  Dovtors do not know you from one visit to the next.
0.800000	I have been with the same primary care physician for 15 years now. We have an excellent relationship where she is honest with me about what changes I need to make for better health, and I am honest with her about what my health goals are and the treatment I am or am not willing to undergo. She never tries to pressure me into making a healthcare choice that goes against what I want to do.
0.960000	Three generations of my family use my doctor as their primary care physician, and we all feel very comfortable with her. She has, on multiple occasions, found something of concern to her and sent us for testing which resulted in medical procedures needing to be performed. She prescribes medicine when we're sick, takes the time to fully explain what's going on, and responds quickly to emails/voicemails that we leave her.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because when I come in asking about a condition or medication, she provides comprehensive guidance about why that might not be the best for me, as well as altertives. I feel that she's not just trying to placate me to get me out of the office or quickly move to her next patient. 
0.800000	Because I have experience the medical field and I like his approach. I've had second opinions from colleagues on his diagnosis and treatment recommendations and they usually are consistent with what my colleagues suggest. 
0.640000	I think that these days that doctors are trying to push more and more drugs that half the time you dont need. That is pretty scary to think about. Also treatment varies greatly from doc to doc even on simple things like a infection. So there are times i cant trust the doc 100%
0.760000	They have many years of training, and I do not. That's the long and short of it, really. I trust them.
0.760000	"I don't ask a whole lot of good questions, so I'm just like ""I guess you have the degree and experience, so whatever you say."" Maybe this is trusting enough but maybe this doesn't allow me the best control of my health."
1.000000	I fully trust my PCP. He is always verbose in his explations and open to any and all questions. He has fostered a great trusting relationship.
0.520000	I do not like authority
0.720000	My doctors give me the facts. He or she does not sugarcoat my diagnosis. That makes me trust them.
0.800000	I trust my PCP because he seems to care about my health.  He takes time to understand my questions and give me advise.
0.720000	I trust them because i know them and they know me well. I dont really have any distrust for him and overall i dont see why i would with anyone else.
0.920000	I get along very well with my doctor. I feel she genuinely cares about my well being, both physically and mentally. She is very sweet and kind.
0.800000	My primary care physician has taken care of my family for years and is pretty trustworthy. She's also very open about how her decision process works. So I'm fairly confident in her.
0.800000	I don't have any specific reasons, I think I am just inclined to believe what my doctor is saying is accurate. I almost never doubt my doctor, or any doctors I have seen.
0.560000	My PCP seems rushed when I see her. She also seems tired and overworked. She seems like she cares a little, but she explains things to me but doesn't try to be super thorough. I probably wouldn't keep seeing her if I had actual health problems.
0.600000	"I have a new PCP so I don't totally trust her yet. She seemed to just gloss over any ""problems"" that I addressed with her during our first encounter. "
0.480000	"I think my doctor is very, ""typical"", in that they tell you what is on the paperwork with little regard as to your persol situation. While they are obviously competent, they are not exactly empathetic."
0.600000	I'm pretty neutral on this one. I feel that most doctors DO want to help you, but they also want to drag it out as long as possible for profit reasons. The end goal is a cure/help, but it's going to be VERY expensive.
0.600000	I would trust him. Unless your instincts say otherwise
0.440000	i don't usually trust doctors because they just make me feel uncomfortable. sometimes i feel like they don't listen to me at all. i also oftentimes feel like i am being judged by them. 
0.320000	Every single PCP I have had the displeasure of dealing with has been arrogant and rude to me. They don't seem to take anything I say seriously, and seem to just want to get the visitation over with. It's a one-size-fits-all approach for these guys.
0.600000	PCPs can be shadowed by other influences such as medical companies to push their products for kickbacks.  This is not true for every PCP but it is known.
0.760000	I do not have a primary care physician but I on the few occasions that I go to the dr, I trust what they tell me.
0.560000	I've had persistent neck pain for the last decade and was prescribed all sorts of treatment ranging from medication to injections. After basically giving up I found a simple over-the-counter medication that worked and had never been recommended.
0.680000	I trust her to do what is right for me but I'm not afraid to ask for a second opinion if I need to (thankfully I've never had to do that). She hasn't let me down yet so I have trust in her. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor because they're always helpful and open with me, they take the time to answer any questions. My doctor has also returned emails and chats in my medical portal, so I have more trust in them.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because of the wonderful service that she provides me with. She always answers my questions and provides feedback for me regarding my questions.
0.440000	I do not think I do not trust my doctor, I just think she is rushed. She always has a ton of patients and book them so close together to make money that the care suffers. She rarely has time to talk about any concerns she is more in and out of the room. 
0.600000	In regards to doctors I feel like they can be trusted for the most part. They have a lot riding on being perfect in their profession. They can lose their jobs and whole practices if they don't perform. I think they can mainly be trusted because of this.
0.600000	typically it is best to trust your instincts. if the doc seems good trust him
0.840000	For the most part I think I trust my doctor. She always takes her time and really listens to what I have to say before making any sort of rash decision. If I have any questions she's more than willing to answer and we talk what would be best for me. She's very kind and I find it easy to discuss things with her. Overall I think  I trust her decisions and think that she has my best interests at heart.
0.640000	I generally trust my primary care physician due to the relationship that we have developed. Over the several years that I have visited their office I have come to know and trust the opinion of my doctor and feel that he is looking out for what is the best for me. 
0.800000	She always gives it to me straight and never tells me any bull. She tells me what she thinks is wrong and tries to help me understand what is going on with my body. 
0.760000	My doctor is a professiol and uses their best judgement in dealings with my health. They also explain things to me and answer questions I have. This is why I trust my doctor. 
0.800000	MY primary care physician is always thorough with me and gives me good advice in regards to my treatment. I have always gotten better by doing what he says so I have a lot of faith in his judgements
0.600000	Doctors are just like everyone else. Some you can trust, and others you cannot.
0.720000	I feel like I listen to what they say but then wait to form my own opinion on it. I haven't always had doctors give me accurate diagnoses. Sometimes I have to do my own research and tell them what I have before they can tell me themselves.
0.720000	I think that the doctor is good at her job, but she is young and seems a little inexperienced. I am not sure if that's a good or bad thing though, as generatiol differences can cloud judgement and can cause physicians to not keep up with the times or to not realize the correct standards of care.
0.800000	I've been going to the same primary care physician for about 20 years. He knows my medical history and has given me sound advice during that time. It is a relationship built on trust.
0.800000	They have not let me down. They have a lot of experience and they know what is best.
0.800000	I feel that doctors are for the most part trustworthy. But in general some are in a big hurry to get to the next patient. They sometimes make it seem like  are putting them out to ask many questions. Like you are wasting their time.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they have not given me any reason to not trust them.  I believe in the basic trust of professiols that I interact with.  If I didn't trust them I wouldn't go to them for treatment.
0.800000	I just started seeing a new doctor so I suppose I don't know enough to completely trust her yet, but she's already much better than my previous doctor. She's very friendly and treats me more like an equal than like a patient she has authority over. She's easy to talk to and joke around with, and seems like she wants what's best for me even if she has to go out of her way to do it.
0.400000	My primary care physician has dismissed my worries and problems before. She misdiagnosed one of my family members and that family member ended up in the hospital because of it.
0.960000	I have no reason not to trust my primary physician . He has always seemed concerned and knowledgeable, always making sure my needs have been taken care of.  
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician. I've known my doctor for years and haven't had a bad experience dealing with the doctor or doctor's office in general. The information I've been given thus far has been correct and helpful. Therefore, until I have a bad experience, my trust is secure.
0.960000	I believe that doctors have my best interest in mind when treating me.
0.600000	He doesn't spend much time with me and it seems like he is just trying to get me out of the door as fast as he can.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to ask my opinion on which way I would prefer to go for certain treatments of issues I've had. She will give me information and her opinion and statistics but she ultimately will let me decide which route I would prefer to take.
0.480000	"I really hate how ""trust"" is even a factor. It bothers me that when I'm given information, it sounds a lot like a factual answer when in fact it is an opinion. I've met young doctors who are bright, older doctors who are dim, and vice versa, so it's difficult to gauge the competency of who I'm speaking to. And really, the only way to tell if someone is right or wrong is if I know the answer already, which I almost never do. "
0.680000	I don't trust many doctors because alot prove to be more after money than helping the patients
0.640000	My primary care doctor knows both of my parents and is a very blunt person in general. I do not shirk from getting the information I want so I am not scared too ask questions.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because they are more knowledgeable than I am but I do not give them complete trust until I read and understand the options myself and am able to agree or disagree with them. 
0.800000	I have a relatively good experience with the doctors I've visited. I made sure to ask close family and friends about certain doctors they visited and which ones to avoid. I was able to draw conclusions from there.
0.680000	I trust my physician because I believe he is very knowledgeable and he considers different possibilities- he doesn't jump to conclusions. 
1.000000	My physicians seems to want me to stay healthy. They give good and reasoble advice.
0.720000	I've had the same primary for nearly my whole adult life. He also has had my parents as patients for many years. 
0.680000	I will trust my doctor because he can find the minor issue that other doctor may not be found.
0.800000	They seem trustworthy.  It is the insurance company I do not trust.
0.520000	I feel with their busy schedules, as much as they like to dwell on a patient, unless you're going to ask lots of questions.  They will give you a primary brief overview and description of your issue and then move on to the next.  Doctors are forced to see so many patients in a day and in between squeeze a break in.  With that limitation there is only so much persol care they can have.
0.560000	Doctors can be wrong, I have been in scerios where I have gotten multiple diagnoses from  multiple doctors upon getting a second, and third opinion.
0.680000	I don't really have a primary care physician, I have been uninsured for many years. I try to put my trust in any doctor that is willing to see me on a self-pay, emergency basis. That is reality, and those are my choices in that reality.
0.640000	I like my doctor and he has always been conservative in his treatments.  He lets me know when something will have a side affect and also lets me know when he is doubtful that something will work but is willing to try.  I feel that he is in general very honest with me.
0.800000	I actually just met my PCP, but she came in having clearly read my file. She took a lot of time with me, didn't appear rushed at all. She had a good bed side manner. She gave appropriate recommendations and explained things well.
0.240000	I barely trust mainstream doctors at all. A lot of their diagnoses are just guesses, but they act as if they KNOW what they're talking about and the patient doesn't. I use doctors mainly when I want a particular test done or think I need a prescription.
0.760000	I trust most doctors in general. I feel they provide adequate enough healthcare services. I don't really have a reason to not trust them because I feel like they know enough about whatever health-related things to made accurate assessments of my health. 
0.800000	Dr. Dixon is comforting for the most part and I have been a patient of hers for a long time so that helps me trust her. But sometimes I get confused.
1.000000	I have been going to my primary physician for almost 4 years now and never once have I felt that I was not important to her. She has been supportive and attentive always.
1.000000	I've had the same doctor since I was a kid and in fact, he is my family's doctor. So my mother and even grandmother have a great deal of experience with him. He's willing to talk, answer questions and usually does well. Plus he hasn't killed any of us yet, so that's a great bonus.
0.840000	She is always patient with me and takes as long as I need.  She never seems bothered when I ask her questions, and if I call with a problem, she usually can see me that day. 
0.680000	i really have no choice but to put my trust into my doctor sometimes, because health is theyre field. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor but have also disagreed with them over things that I knew were the current recommendations. So we had a discussion and he looked up the new information I gave him and thanked me for making him aware of it. Doctors are incredibly smart but things are constantly changing so I feel it is important to listen to them but, also advocate for yourself.
0.600000	Although I don't doubt that my primary care physician cares about me, I also believe that they are not my best friend. I try my best to listen to what they tell me but I also research the information I'm given on my own and find out what the best course of action is.
0.560000	I do not really like my doctor but it is hard to change to a new one. I live in a small town. I trust many doctors though because they have a lot to lose so they tend to try very hard to do their best.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she has been my doctor for 24 years.
0.400000	my appendix had burst and my dr couldnt diagnose it
0.520000	As with most things/people, a medical professiol can have an agenda they are pushing and most of the time it's for monetary reasons. I don't believe in taking unneccessary medicine and sometimes I don't trust the dr when they tell me I need to take a medicine when I think there is a better treatment option available.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me and I have never had a reason to not trust her. She is good at her job and a very nice person, so it is easy to trust her and her opinion
0.760000	Most doctors choose to do what's right because if they get caught doing otherwise, they could lose their license. That is why I trust them in general.
0.400000	I haven't had a major sickness that would require me to seek out a new PCP so I've stayed with the one I've had since I was a teeger.  
0.880000	I trust doctors because i believe that they have my best interests at heart
0.560000	My doctor is pretty conventiol and doesn't explore any new avenues of thinking. Sometimes I have to offer him ideas on what might help me.
0.760000	I have had my primary care doctor for quite a few years now. She knows me well, and I trust that she will do what is best for my health. She is also available to talk to outside of office hours which is really great.
0.960000	I trust my primary care doctor because he has been seeing people in my family for over 40 years. Most of my immediate family go to the same doctor and he is very persoble and a straight shooter. He does not beat around the bush when he needs to tell you something.
0.720000	I feel they have a lot of knowledge and this is their expertise.  I also feel like my doctor tries to get to know me. 
0.800000	For the most part I trust my doctor (who is actually a PA).  I can see in his eyes and actions that he really is reading my material and really does want to help.  It is my responsibility to make sure anything he says applies to me but for the most part I go along with what he says because of the time and care he puts into his words.
0.960000	I've known my doctor for 25 years and I see us more as friends than a doctor-patient relationship.
0.800000	I have a very nice woman as my primary doctor. I can trust anything she tells me to do or take.
0.360000	I do not trust completely in my doctor or any doctor for that matter. In 2010, I kept having chest pains and the doctor said that it was nothing. I had them for about a week and then one day I almost passed out in the parking of my electric company and I was taken to the ER. Come to find out I had a blood clot in my lung. I do not trust doctors. If I have a illness I will try and fix it myself.
0.440000	I don't really trust my doctor very much because i feel that sometimes they are too caught up in all the drug company's ideas that certain medicines work for thing they don't or are trying to perscribe medicines due to kick backs from companys
0.760000	I've been seeing my PCP mostly for anxiety issues and so because we've talked about the reasons why the anxiety might be happening, she was very understanding and informative.
0.680000	I trust her for the most part except when I had my first kid she didn't figure out ahead of time that my baby was breech so I ended up having an unexpected C-section. 
0.560000	My primary care doctor is mostly considerate and kind but often gives me the impression that he is overworked. He has had the tendency to forget certain things about me to the point where I have needed to remind him of things in visits (ie: medication allergy). He has never directly put me in danger with any of his decisions but I would trust him more if he was less rushed and willing to spend more time getting familiar with me and my health.
0.800000	I have been with the same doctor for 11 years and he has never given me any reason to not trust him - he is very thorough and concise in his diagnoses and gives me the best overall advice and information that I could ever hope for with any doctor. 
0.800000	I chose my doctor out of a few that I've visited over the years. She's always eager to answer questions and is professiol, all the while still having a kind demeanor.
0.800000	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, and the care I get from her is always excellent. I am able to ask questions and get answers when I need to and she is never rushed or indifferent to my needs.
0.800000	I've had my PCP for a while and he is probably the most down to earth doctor that I've come across. Always explains things throughly, always gives options.
0.640000	My doctor just seems so busy. It's hard to tell if he really pays attention to me and my health because I am only seen for a few minutes. 
0.960000	Very caring doctor. She is non-judgemental.
0.640000	I distrust doctors because they work for big companies and the companies are in it to make money therefore the doctors have to find a way to make that money.
0.920000	I believe he is smart and thorough. I don't usually need him for many things but he has always had good advice when I do have a problem.
1.000000	She has always been very thorough in her explations and care. She has also always made my options very clear to me.
0.720000	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  But I know that we are all human and humans make mistakes.
0.920000	I have known my PCP since I was 13 and friends with his daughter. I am usually very healthy and don't go to the doctor very often, but I do trust him as my doctor. 
1.000000	i have had him for 11 years and never once has he not taken my questions or worries with seriousness.
1.000000	FIRST, HE IS WELL EDUCATED AND HAS TAKEN AN OATH.   SECOND, I DID RESEARCH ABOUT HIM AND HIS BACKGROUND.  ALSO, I CAN TELL BY HIS PERSOLITY AND TALKING WITH JIM.
0.800000	Well I think you have to trust that your doctor knows more than you do and is trying to do what is best for you. My doctor always explains all of my options and makes recommendations but still asks for my input as well. I trust he wants to do what is best for me.
0.280000	As of late, my doctor has been pretty dismissive of my health concerns. He is very busy and spends almost no time evaluating me. Because of this, I am currently searching for a new doctor. I feel that he does not take what I have to say seriously. 
0.880000	When I had Kaiser, I didn't trust them at all. They prescribed Codine for every little thing that I had. Now I have a private doctor through PPO and they are spot on, I'm always feeling better, I never feel like I get the run around. This difference can make my answers fill mixed. But if you were to ask me how I felt between HMO and PPO health care, it would be a landslide of an opinion.
0.760000	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable about the field of medicine than I am, so I listen to them.
0.880000	I have done a lot of research and tried several different doctors in the the surrounding cities until I landed with one who I trust greatly. 
0.600000	I often feel as if they are already thinking of the next patient. It is usually a hurried experience.
0.800000	He's the expert. I don't know much about medicine, so I don't have much choice. Additiolly, he's always been open and honest with me about my treatment options, side effects, etc.
0.800000	My doctor has been my doctor for over ten years. He is never rushed and always takes time to answer my questions and concerns.  I like that he values my input and will look up things that I tell him about.  He seems genuinely concerned about my care.  He is easy to talk to.
0.440000	Doctors are influenced by the number they can put on your bill.  If it costs more they'll recommend it.  Also pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to push their drugs over something that may be more appropriate for my condition.
0.560000	they have a duty to do their job at least competently, but i don't know my PCP very well so I can't really make a persol judgment, my doctor seems pretty busy and rushes me a lot
1.000000	I know my primary care physician outside of the office, and I know what kind of person he is. I trust his judgments for my medical care because I know he is a good person who truly cares about other people and wants what is best for them. I know his family, and how he treats and cares for them. It puts me at ease when I am dealing with him in a professiol capacity.
0.800000	I have a long-standing patient/doctor relationship with my doctor. She is trustworthy and thorough, and always takes time to ask me in-depth questions and relate to me on a human level.
0.800000	i trust my primary care doctor because that's the doctor i've had since i was born. She has all of my medical records. So, its just easier to stay with her and trust her knowledge of me.
0.800000	I trust the doctor and I rely on their education and experience.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has yet to give me any false or misleading information. He spends time talking to me and doesn't rush me out of the door. Listens to my concerns/questions and answers them well
0.560000	I have switched doctors until I have found one I trust.  Prior to that I truly felt as though the Drs wanted to make money on procedures and medications.  I felt as though they pushed the same things and it was for a monetary reason.  Currently my Drs really listen and I am involved with my health care choices.
0.680000	I trust them somewhat. They do want the best for their patients. They are also in the pockets of medical industry. They at there to make money too. They may not have the best information and think they are experts because of their education. 
0.760000	I have gotten a new primary care physician in the past year and she has been more thorough and careful than any doctor I've had previously.  My past PCP rushed through appointments and gave me prescriptions without much concern.  My new PCP is careful to suggest medications and tries to find if altertive therapies may work better and to ensure that I am really getting something I need.  
0.800000	She goes out of her way to make sure I feel comfortable and to see if anything else is wrong. She tells me things about herself if she has similar problems to make me feel better about my issues. 
0.600000	I trust that they will tell me what they think. However, I'm not always convinced that they're up to date on the very latest options. I also think they sometimes omit borderline information (i.e., risks or treatments that are on the extreme ends of the normal bell curve) just out of the sake of time. I generally trust them, as far as it goes, though.
0.600000	My primary care physician keeps leaving and I haven't met the new one, but I think they are fine. I worry that I don't know what a patient is supposed to do.
0.360000	My primary care doctor never ask me what I want or how I feel about a treatment, she just tells me what to do. She wanted me to remove my gallbladder but never asked me if I was ok with it or if there were altertives. I cured myself with limonene. I feel i no longer need her help most of the time.
0.480000	I've only recently started seeing her. I had an issue wrong and I feel like instead of truly trying to figure out what was wrong , she just sent me out for any test she felt could possibly solve it for her. Then when the tests didn't work, she was quickly done with me and wanted to refer me out. She has also put me on some questioble medications for this without explaining fully the side effects or that I could have a bad reaction to one of them.
0.600000	I do trust that doctors are not in it to just make the money, but to provide good health care. They will be honest it what they think is the best treatment for you. However, I know doctor's cannot go into detail about the possible long term effects of a treatment so I always like to do my own research. Particularly reading forums and such.
0.880000	The Physician's Assistant that I see (I normally do not see the actual doctor) is very pleasant and seems caring. She does not seem rushed or like she is trying to hurry through the appointment. She also gives me the opportunity to ask questions about any diagnosis or treatment.
0.640000	My doctor is very candid. She always lets me know the possible effects and she has no problem telling me what she thinks. However, she just rushes too much and seems like she has better things to be doing.
0.760000	I think that their reputation are on the line so they are generally honest.  There are people who expect miracles from doctors so sometimes the doctor has to answer the best he can but needs to move on to the next patient so he may be a bit short with answers. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor because I have never been led astray. I have never had a negative experience with my doctor. I have no reason to doubt my doctor's competence or motives and have had good outcomes.
0.560000	There have been times where my doctor has been wrong. But I do have two specialists that often go the extra mile for me and I feel I can trust. 
0.720000	I generally trust my doctor. He always goes above and beyond to make sure my needs are met and keeps me up to date regarding my health.
0.800000	I have never had a medical issue where I didn't know what was wrong before going in to see him. I usually show up for an appt and explain what's going on and know exactly how he's going to treat me.
0.960000	Always takes the time to explain things in detail and answer questions, never rushes me and believes in finding the cause and not just treating the symptom
0.760000	I have been seeing this doctor for some time for a serious illness. So far they have maged it quite well so I trust their judgement
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been able to help me. I have been going to the same doctor since I was a teeger.
0.960000	My doctor explains most things clearly to me. He genuinely shows he cares and checks up on me outside of the office. Quick to answer my concerns as well.
0.600000	I dont think I've ever trusted a doctor completely. When I see them taking meetings with pharm reps and so many patients they only have about 5-10 minutes with each, I dont feel very confident about everything they say and do. They seem to go on vacation a lot too.
0.760000	My doctor is a seasoned professiol. He has really good persol qualities. That makes me feel will do no harm when it comes to his medical advice.
0.760000	I feel doctors truly care for their patients and want the best for them.
0.240000	I think they are too much influenced by money, corruption and big pharma. 
1.000000	I've been going to the same doctor for years. He is very kind and shows that he actually cares about my wellbeing. He is never in a hurry and explains everything to me in a way that I can understand.
0.680000	I don't trust him because a few years ago he prescribed medication for high blood pressure that almost killed me. The side-affects were so bad I had to go into the er room.
0.720000	I trust the GYN I have, she takes her time and sits to answer my questions and chat. I never feel rushed or neglected by her. I have been to doctors in the past though that spend minimal time with you and it doesn't feel like they actually care about you.
0.880000	My doctor tells me all of the options I have, even if they don't benefit him.
0.560000	Sometimes my doctors can be in such a rush I simply get a nod and they would try and attend me as quick as possible to get even more patients in. Half the time I end up having to go back because he didn't feel like listening to my problem so it wasn't tended to and I end up getting worse.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician for the most part, I have only meet her once. I am still working on putting my complete trust in her. I completely trusted my previous doctor since I had been with her for many years. Switching made me uneasy. But I trust in her and her education. 
0.760000	I usually trust my primary care physician because I know he cares about my health. He usually takes the time to explain things thoroughly if he feels like I don't understand them.
0.840000	I've been seeing the same doctor for a long time. He knows by medical history very well. He's a very friendly man who doesn't rush through appointments, and really does listen to my concerns. I've grown to trust him very much and feel he makes good decisions for my health.
0.560000	Honestly, I trust doctors to a certain extent as far as diagnosing a problem, but I think their treatment options are generally given according to what makes them the most money. 
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has always been right about what treatments I need over the years, and he has been my doctor for a long time. Since he has never been wrong, I feel that I can trust him. 
0.560000	They try to rush during a visit and get to the next patient as soon as possible.
0.600000	it is neutural, because sometimes where I am from they just want a quick fix  and try to just take care of the issue as quick as they can
0.840000	My physician is always honest without being judgmental.  She tells me steps I can take, but understands when these steps are difficult to fit into my life.  She also is happy if changes are made as small steps or trying to complete one healthy change at a time, rather than expect me to completely alter my lifestyle.
0.320000	No one should completely trust a doctor. He has an invested reason to tell you all these things that you can do without. His pockets get bigger when he gets you to do more things that are not needed. 
0.800000	I feel that my doctor does all that they can to provide me the best healthcare. I have never felt that they were being dishonest with me. They alwayws are open to my questions and doubts.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she has shown me, over the years, that she has my best interest at heart. She listens to me and my concerns and together we come up with a plan to take care of whatever problem I am experiencing at that time.
0.360000	I don't currently have a primary care physician. My last one, who I'd see once a year for a basic check-in and a prescription refill for my anti-anxiety med, told me last year not to come back anymore because I'm uninsured (stuck in a state-caused ACA loophole) and can't afford more in-depth exams. Being told something like that kind of dented my trust in medical professiols in general.
0.800000	I've been going to him for quite some time now. We've developed a good relationship. He's frank and honest and that's exactly what I expect.
0.760000	
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been super honest and up front with me. He has always taken the time to explain everything that needs to be explained and he has never hidden anything from me when it comes to my medical conditions or illnesses. 
0.760000	My doctor seems genuine and intelligent. She generally provides me with a range of options before prescribing a particular one. She seems heartfelt and concerned, and takes time to talk with me.
1.000000	He lets me be a part of the plan of treatment and always asks what I think aand if I agree or disagree. He always takes the time to listen and is very willing to see me whenever i need him too. He explains everything to me in a way that I understand and is very patient, kind and gentle. is office always calls to see how I am doing.
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him. He is looking out for my best interests. He takes his time to listen to me. He is never rushed - or at least doesn't show it. He is friendly and helpful and I trust him.
0.760000	I feel she is very thorough.  She has done more tests on me then previous doctors, and usually has answers for me on any questions I have.
0.880000	Recently finished medical training.  Listens.
0.840000	I trust my doctor since i feel like they are just looking for what is best for me
0.680000	I trust my doctor because I trust the profession. I appreciate that he explains things alytically, which is consistent with the way I process information.
0.880000	My doctor has been working in the field for a long time, so I trust her. I can also tell from her tone of voice that she really cares about the welfare of her patients, so I can trust her 100%. 
0.760000	Is open to talking with me, never makes me feel rushed.  Listens to my concerns about potential treatments.  Keeps a level head, and is persoble...not a robot.
0.760000	I have just started with her, but she seems to be communicative, alytical, takes time to explain, moderately to highly intelligent, sympathetic, and experienced.
0.600000	Doctors in general seem to be more jaded with their profession. They seem more concerned with simply medicating and moving patients along rather than spending time to determine what the best course of action is. I have seen it with a lot of doctors as well as vets for animals. It could be because there is an increased number of cases that they process, I'm not sure. But it's alarming.
0.800000	"My doctor always suggests tural remedies first if the condition is not serious. She is not a ""pill pusher"" like most. My mother used to work with her also. She is also my mother's doctor now that she no longer works with her."
1.000000	My PCP doctor has been treating me for more than 20 years now.  He also is part of a very small practice that is in the country side.  Even though I live farther away from his practice now, I still commute to see him because I trust him based on our long history and the experiences I have had with him in the past.  He tends to be very honest with me with regards to everything that we talk about. 
1.000000	He has my interest and always keeps me aware of my health and what I should be aware of as I grow older. The things we must do to keep me healthy
0.600000	I have trust in his ability as a doctor and his medical doctor, but he is a very busy doctor in a poor neighborhood, so it can be hard to keep his attention on something that doesn't seem very bad from an outside perspective. 
0.800000	I have generally had positive experiences and never had a bad experience with a doctor. I have always received proper care.
0.800000	My physician seems like they are well educated and seem to communicate well with other people. Their ability to portray information to me is critical in deserving my trust, and I have had no problems at all regarding this. I feel that most doctors are so well educated that they have a good idea what is going on and how to treat it, and they can get more information readily if necessary, so overall I trust them due to their education and ability to communicate.
0.760000	I don't have a PCP, but do feel that most doctors are looking out for their patients' best interests and can be trusted.
0.800000	He always seems to care about my health. He takes time to explain and talk to me. 
0.800000	i trust my physical because if there is any problem at any time of the day, i know she will be there for me. 
0.920000	My doctor is very paiteint with me and other paitients. She takes the time to explain things and answers all questions I have. I never feel that I am inconveniencing her when I visit with a problem.
0.800000	I find that my pcp takes her time when examining and listens to what I am saying. She is stern about certain things but does not push unnecessary treatments or procedures. 
0.720000	I know that doctors aren't perfect, but they go through one of the most rigorous schooling systems of any profession. If they don't know the answer then nobody does.
0.240000	I have a terrible list of back problems and the doctor is afraid to give me anything stronger because of all of the opiod addiction in the country, even though I've never done anything wrong. so he keeps giving me expensive medicines that don't work and wont listen to me when i talk to him. he seems in a hurry to get me out of the office.  
0.520000	It's always wise to get a second opinion or look for more information. Doctors are not perfect and cannot know every single bit of medical information in the world. There may be newer treatments or updated diagnoses. Also, some doctors are kind of in bed with the pharmaceutical industry and might recommend a drug just to increase sales. This is not necessarily common, but not unheard of either.
1.000000	I trust her because she has always told me the exactly how she felt about any situation. She answers all questions the way she sees fit and now just because it would be what I want to hear. She is straight forward with anything she tells me. She also has never told me wrong and has helped me a lot.
0.560000	I trust they'll do just enough to keep me alive long enough to bleed my pockets
0.720000	I've been seeing him for several years now, and have always followed his recommendations, which have been very useful. I expect this relationship to continue going forward. 
0.640000	I usually choose a primary care physician with lots of experience. I based my trust off of his experience and user review online.
0.280000	I feel as if my concerns are not addressed by my doctor.  I feel he is too busy with too many patients and will tell me one thing in one phone call and a week later will forget his direction to me or forget what we discussed or what my initial concern was about in the first place.  He isn't a problem solver for me but rather he dismisses my concerns and makes me feel unimportant.
0.880000	In the above I was talking about my OBGYN. I have to see him often for complications and cancer screenings. He is always straight forward with me, and has actually saved my life twice. 
1.000000	Ive been seeing this doctor for a long time and she actually happens to be a relative through marriage many many years ago so i have no reason to believe she would be completely honest so i am the same with her
0.760000	I like my doctor.  She took me on as a patient even though she was not accepting new patients.  She helped me through a very difficult time.  She listens to what I have to say and especially how I feel.
0.640000	i don't know them well and they're a conventiol doctor who wants to deal with symptoms rather than root causes, which isn't something i agree with. i do my own research and speak with a relative who is a doctor as well.
0.800000	He has saved my life on one occasion and my daughter's life in another. He is very thorough and helpful. I have been seeing him for over 25 years. He knows me. 
0.240000	Doctors seem very disinterested and distant. They don't seem to fully take my complaints into account and they always seem in a rush to get me out as fast as possible. I hate being treated that way. 
0.760000	I am not smart enough to not trust my doctor completely. I don't go to the doctor that often, but when I do I take them at face value. They have never steered me wrong when I have needed them in the past.
1.000000	I have known her all my life she is my best friend that happens to be my doctor
0.960000	My doctor takes her time to listen to my concerns and is not in a rush to get me out the door.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to what I have to say and thoroughly explains whatever I do not understand. I trust his opinion and I feel like he cares about me as a patient.
0.520000	i mostly trust my doctors but I need to double check through independent research to have full confidence
0.720000	I mostly trust my doctor. Though, he is a person just like others with flaws.
0.800000	I've had her for 2 years and she'll always take the time to explain things to me and seems genuinely concerned. Since I'm on medicare not all doctors seem to think I'm not worth their time. That hasn't happened too much though. 
0.440000	i am aware of how they push medications that are provided them by certain pharmeceutical companies.  i also have witnessed first hand a doctor going to his office after assessing patient, and consulting with an encyclopedia to see what the patient has.  I think doctors are smart, but sometimes I think we give them too much credit.  They have to remember a ton of shit.
0.680000	My doctor seems always pressed for time everytime I go there. He rushes me in/out without really talking in depth. But he seems to know what he's doing, so I sort of trust him. I will speak up next time it bothers me.
1.000000	I trust my physician because he has always been good to me and given me accuracy and professiolism.
0.800000	My doctor listens to me. She tells me te tests I should get and talks about my weight.
0.720000	Although doctors have to function in quick way due to overwhelming amounts of daily patients, it is unlikely that they have any bad intentions in mind. In my persol experience my doctor has always been honest and upfront with treatments and diagnosis.
0.760000	In general, I trust doctors as they have a tremendous amount of experience, but they are also sometimes rrow in their views of what types of remedies work. So, I trust but reserve my right to question things.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for several years, and he has always provided me with great care, and I have never had an issues with any of his decisions/ diagnoses. He has a good record of quality and care.
0.480000	It's not that I think he's intentiolly deceiving me for some insidious purpose. I'm just read and heard about doctors getting bonuses for the amount of patients they can get on certain drugs (they get kick backs) weather this is true or not, we shouldn't ever just blindly follow someone because they went to school for awhile. Would if the school was corrupt? Would if Big Pharma changes the medical doc-turn so that the doctors believe its right, but it's actually wrong. 
0.640000	My doctor is very knowledgeable but he sees many patients each day. I feel that he can make mistakes from time to time.
0.760000	I trust him because he is persoble and lets me tell him what I am comfortable with and not. He isn't pushy, but will always do what is best for his patients.
0.600000	I trust my doctor, but I understand that she has pressures and influences that may not lead to the best care for me. I believe a patient must take an active part in their own care if possible.
0.680000	I do believe my doctor is honest, thorough, and careful for the most part. I think sometimes time constrictions can force her to be a little less thorough, especially when it comes to explaining why she is choosing a certain treatment. At times, I have trouble trusting doctors because I don't understand how they know the treatment they have chosen will work.
0.800000	There's no reason for me not to trust my doctor. I haven't had any ill experiences, and she always seems willing to answer any questions that I may have in regards to procedures or medications.
0.600000	I don't go to the doctor often, but they are more knowledgeable than me so I believe them
0.520000	Dr's work and are obligated to the pharma business. That is their main goal, patients are secondary.
0.680000	I've had a few doctors and most i feel cared about me, but sometimes i did feel like they weren't putting their full thoughts into correct treatments.  Sometimes they'll let a problem sit and see if it fixes itself, or sometimes they'll try to do whatever would be easier for them if it does require prescribing something.
0.640000	He seems to know what he is talking about most of the time, but he doesn't explain things in detail that I can understand. I have trouble keeping up at times so sometimes I don't think he wants to see me anymore. I trust that he knows what he is talking about, but it all just flies over my head. 
0.800000	I've been seeing them for most of my life since I was a young child.  I believe they've always treated me with their best interest and care.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because so far he hasn't done anything to erode my trust for him. I am wary of my physician when he tells me treatment methods. This is more so because I am a cautious person.
0.600000	I am not sure about those decisions since I only go to my doctor for annual check these years
0.960000	I trust my doctor, but not completely. I do not, as a rule, trust Doctors in general. They all seem to start out good people, but most of them become greedy, and want to fix everything with pills. There is more to fixing someone than just pills.There is a job to do, most Doctors are not doing it properly.
0.720000	She is competent and very thorough, but I feel she relies on prescription drugs too heavily as a course of treatment. I would like to know about altertive treatments and therapies.
0.840000	I feel those called to such a high involvement with the human condition deserve our respect and ultimately admiration. The rigors of their study and training predispose them to being credible.
0.960000	My doctors have saved my life, and I believe that they do an outstanding job.
0.920000	I tend to trust my Dr and their opinions because I have disclosed all the symptoms that I have been experiencing therefor I believe they can accurately provide me with a diagnosis.  I also believe that my Dr is also looking out for my best interest.
0.800000	I trust him because he seems to know what he's doing. So far he's been right.So I trust him.
0.560000	In some ways I feel they push drugs on you because they get a cut of it.  Some doctors just rush though with you and move onto the next patient for money.  
0.880000	 I trust my doctor as he has never steered me wrong.  I have no reason to believe that he would or that he would be not being honest with me.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been honest with me and has always given me clear direction. He has never pushed any drugs or treatments on me that would be unnecessary. He is very thorough and complete when I go in to visit. He makes me feel very comfortable when I am with him, and I never leave his office feeling confused. 
0.800000	I have always been completely satisfied with my Doctor. Always thorough gives me the goods and the bads and tells me it straight forward not holding back 
0.680000	My primary care physician is very kind and listens to my problems, so I have high confidence and trust in him.
0.720000	I have been seeing my Pcp my entire life. He has always been honest and helpful. I have gained a lot of trust over the years
0.800000	My primary care physician is very nice woman. She knows a lot, always friendly, and ready to give me any explation I need.
0.800000	I do trust my primary care physician because they are a person who I've been seeing for several years now, and whenever any health problems arise, the solutions provided by said physician are very effective in solving these problems.
0.480000	my old doctor was wonderful he explained everything in a way someone could understand and he was nice and cared.  He got a new job with the government and now I go to his partner he had at the practice.  The new doctor (old doctors partner) doesn't care...he just wants to get you in and out of there fast.
0.920000	I trust my doctor to evaluate me and to be honest with me. He is very good at referring me to other good doctors and I trust him to do this.
0.680000	I do trust my doctor, she seems very informed, and she never takes a guess unless she is sure. I appreciate how organized and detail-oriented she is. My reservations mostly come from my hesitation to fully trust in another person. While medicine has been revolutionized, it is still not an exact science, and things can go wrong at any moment, so while I do trust my doctor, I am not sure I would ever 100% accept everything they told me without some reservations about their correct diagnosis. 
0.640000	I generally think they are looking out for me and have my best interests at heart. 
0.960000	She has been my doctor for the last 11 years, and as soon as I met her I trusted her.  She was warm and caring and took time to listen to me.  She is extremely thorough and such a great doctor. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he is very experienced. He is very sincere and honest with me. He is very down to earth and tells me like it is, regardless of how I feel.
0.440000	My doctor always seems like he's in a rush and doesn't seem like he is always concerned about answering all my questions. I think he is more concerned about getting done with each patient quickly. 
0.760000	I trust doctors because I think they genuinely care about treating their patients. They have high reputations and they don't want to risk diagnosing something wrong. 
0.600000	You can't always believe everything the doctor says in terms of options sometimes they are just looking for the money
1.000000	I have had the same doctor that my dad has been using.  She has been our family doctor for 20 years, and really helped a lot in some trying times.  She is simply the best.
0.440000	I don't think I receive adequate care, attention, or consideration.  I often feel hurried along and my doctor doesn't explain things in much detail, so I'm really under the impression that my doctor just sees each patient as something to cross off a to-do list.
0.600000	I had a 3 month cough, I was told it would get better on its own.
0.760000	My doctor is always pleasant and seems to be treating me fairly. We have not had any issues. I came from a primary care doctor that I did not have any trust for, so this seems like a huge improvement to me. 
0.560000	I go to a primary care physician at a school health center and I think that he is on a tight schedule, and has a lot of patients each day that limits his time to spend diagnosing my problems. 
0.840000	I have been seeing my doctor for a couple of years and she is thorough and trusting.  She is always ready to listen to my concerns.  She addresses preventative medicine with a passion.
0.840000	I mostly trust my doctor, however, I will never 100% rely on their word or advice without looking into myself or seeking other opinions.
0.800000	My doctor is awesome. He's smart and funny but he is also serious when he needs to be. He has always been honest with me and given me many options on what to do next and how to proceed. In almost every single case of him suggesting something, that has been the right suggestion, whether I took his advice or didn't. 
0.920000	I have had the same doctor for a long time and we have come to know each other. I feel she has an exceptiol persolity as well as the skills and knowledge to care for my body.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he does not judge me when I bring health issues to him. He is always very thorough in suggesting treatments. He does a good job explaining WHY I am having the symptoms  I am. 
0.800000	My doctor is new to the family due to the fact the old doctor had to retire. So far from meeting him, he's great. He seems to really want to help and make sure you are taken care of.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my doctor for a long time now. I've experienced good results and up till now I only have positive reviews. 
0.960000	I recently changed physicians to a female doctor and feel that she understands me better than the male doctor. I feel I can trust what she says and like her communication style. 
0.600000	I would hope they was tell me the truth about everything 
0.600000	I trust doctors like I trust policemen: i was brought up to trust them
0.560000	Sometimes he seems rushed and he might get benefits from recommending certain treatment to me, so I try to assess things objectively.
0.680000	I trust my primary care doctor. I have had good experiences with her so far. On the other hand I have only seen her a couple of times.
0.480000	I think in many occassions this is a result of a bad system. I have yet to see a real benefit for a physician to make me healthy. In most cases the physician is looking to see me, diagnose me, treat me, and get me out the door in a short window. With this model there is very little time to have a real conversation about me and my overall health.  
0.400000	The doctor that I have seen does not have a lot of time to see me and does not (because she cannot) remember information about me. She relies on her notes, which I don't find accurate to the information I give her, even when I have corrected her. For example, she had written down that I started birth control a month later than I had. She also changes her mind about my treatment very often and doesn't seem sure about what's necessary or helpful to me.
0.800000	They have shown me options that don't cost me money at all. Something that I can do on my own to help deal with issues I may have. His last resort would be additiol treatment or medication. 
0.520000	I trust that the Dr believes he is being thorough. The PCP gives basic care and refers you to specialists who I believe try to help.  I don't trust any Dr.  I have been to so many for a chronic condition that I don't have total faith in any of them.
0.800000	He listens very well and addresses all my concerns. He knows me and what I'm like, so he can tell when something is wrong. He really cares about his patients and takes the time to listen.
0.440000	I just started with a new PCP and have only seen him once, but I didn't like him and probably won't go back. He was dismissive of all of my health concerns. I've been taking blood pressure meds for years and going off of one blood pressure reading he declared that I didn't need them anymore. I was complaining of aneurysm-like pain in an extremely small spot of my head and he ignored that completely.
0.360000	I have been to my primary care physician twice in two years. The first time they refused to give me the full battery of STD tests I wanted. I had no reason to believe I contracted anything, but because I am non-monogamous I wanted to be responsible, and because I have a phobia of needles and needed a blood draw I figured I'd get all the blood drawing out of the way at once. I had to fight with my doctor and two secretaries for the paperwork, and then when I got my results 3 months later (great processing time - NOT) they STILL hadn't tested for anything! Planned Parenthood handles this sort of thing SO much better than a fricking Catholic Healthcare system. 
0.600000	He tries to help me. He also gets met the only prescription that I need full time. He is pretty helpful.
0.560000	I trust to a point. Aslso as stated he may opt for expedience and convenience whcih may compromise the outcome and care.   its a mix
0.720000	My primary care physician has never given me any reason to doubt her practices. She has always shown both compassion and knowledge. 
0.440000	Sometimes I think they may do what makes them the most money. They may not send you to a Specialist because it takes money away from them. They may also not listen to your idea because they feel they are always right.
1.000000	i feel my doctor always has my best instrest in mind because he always fixes my problems. i trust him 100%.
0.880000	I've known my primary care doctor for a long time already. He is a family friend, the husband of my mother's coworker. As a result, my trust in him is very high. 
0.600000	I would hope for the most part, they are honest with me and I can trust them, but you hear of so many things that happen, and they are so pressed for time usually, that I am always afraid they don't tell you everything in the limited amount of time you are there. My husband recently had to get something done, and they convenient left out some of the adverse side effects.
0.640000	I think that the medical profession has a rrow view of the patient and does not look long term.  It is ultimately up to me to decide on the course of action in my healthcare, after taking the advice of the doctor with a grain of salt.  I do not wholly believe that the doctor knows what is best for me after a brief office visit, only I can know and make this decision.
0.400000	I feel like there have been other treatment options that my doctor didn't tell me about because they got extra money for getting me on something they were in business with.
1.000000	I've been going to the same doctor for 12 years and I completely trust her opinion. She takes her time with me and listens to everything I say. Since I had my children, she also cares for them and does a great job with them.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. She is very thorough and follows up on any concerns I may have. If she is not familiar with something, she researches it so that she can better help me.
0.720000	I have been to many primary care doctors in the past. Because of this, I have gotten to know who is a good doctor and who is not. My current primary care physician is very helpful and caring. She never rushes me and spends as much time as I need answering my questions. She is also familiar with my condition, so I trust her in giving me the correct dosing for my medication. She is also empathic and can explain things in a way that makes sense. 
0.760000	I find my doctor to be very trustworthy. He is open and honest with me and make things easy to understand.
0.400000	"I never get the sense that my doctor really cares about me. I feel like she is just ""punching the clock"" and not engaged in my healthcare."
0.680000	I do not know.  I have not gone to a primary care physician in 17 years.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she hasn't ever given me a reason not to trust her.
0.800000	i trust him because when i have been to the doctor he has diagnosed my condition and treated it effectively with a few exceptions.  I don't like to go to the doctor though and if i can still function with my illness i will try to ignore it until it goes away.
0.480000	I had a doctor I could trust but when we moved to a new state several years ago, I haven't found one I could trust here. I've found larger medical practices where the doctors are in a hurry and you usually end up seeing someone different every time you go.
1.000000	I've been seeing my doctor for a number of years and she has never been anything but honest with me. If she doesn't know the answer to one of my questions, she will admit that and then help me find the answer. She always takes her time and goes over everything with me thoroughly, and I never feel rushed when I am in her office. She knows quite a bit about my persol life and always asks me about my family when I come in. I feel like we are friends.
0.520000	I just feel like he doesn't listen to my concerns sometimes. He also seems distracted a lot. And he doesn't spend very much time with me, either. 
0.800000	My doctor always seems to explain and talk about everything that i have any questions over and it's always quick and to the point but they are also somewhat hurried.
0.840000	I trust my doctor. He really seems to care and treats me like family.
0.800000	My PCP is a very reliable man. He listens to me when I report symptoms and places an importance on my physical and mental health, my overall well-being. He has expressed concern for my health and has instructed me to follow necessary steps to becoming healthier in my everyday life. I appreciate and respect his feedback, and I know that he is looking out for my best interest.
0.680000	Doctors are only people. While highly trained and educated, it is important to make decisions based on what is best for me, the patient. 
0.520000	I have went thru a few primary care physicians in the last 2  years. I've had trouble finding one that wants to listen and help me with my problems. They always seems like they are rude, in a hurry or just push me off on to a specialist. Thats not what I want. 
0.760000	My doctor is very concerned about my questions and always listens to me so that help me develop trust.
0.800000	my doctor has really been great for me in the past. Him and his office have treated me spectacularly through a number of different situations that have arose. I haven't ever felt rushed or uncared for after seeing him.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician. She is thorough and always asks me the right questions. She takes the time with me that expect and answers all my questions and handles all of my concerns. She has a great reputation.
0.960000	My doctor is very experienced.  I can tell much about my doctor by his mannerisms.
0.880000	I normally trust my doctor but I do have ideas of my own for treatment when I think I can use something more tural vs pharmaceutical. 
0.560000	I live in a small town and our doctors are not known for having the best track record for getting diagnosis correct.  We usually use our Primary Care Physician as a way to get to a specialist for a true diagnosis.  I do not let my children go to a local doctor, if they are ill we travel over an hour to take them to a pediatrician's office in a larger city.  
0.680000	I trust doctors because they have a lot of medical knowledge. Their assessments and recommendations usually work for me. I've never had a serious problem with a doctor that would make me lose faith in them.
0.640000	sometimes i feel like i am told i need things i don't really need to milk money out of me. i do not think they would harm me but just trivial things that aren't needed are made to sound like bigger deals then they actually are.
0.800000	I just like him and he is knowledgeable.  I can always research on the internet.  He answers my questions and is patient and kind.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for over ten years and she has always gotten the diagnosis right the first time. I have complete trust in her and we can talk about anything. She always spends time with me and answers my questions.
0.800000	I just made a appointment with my primary I had never seen him or any primary but I thought of my gynecologist who I've seen for years. I trust her because she has kept me healthy and is very polite. She is easy to talk to.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he gives me good advise and when I am having an issue , he is always helpful . He explains to me what to do and what are my best options to feeling better. 
0.720000	I do trust the doctors I see for the most part. In a few cases it seems that they are not engaging with me emotiolly. If I feel emotiol connected to a doctor I am more likely to trust them
0.640000	He is honest and caring.  However, he is not entirely well versed in health issues outside his specialty.  He has made mistakes before and shown that he does not  know how to do certain procedures.  He is good at interl medicine but not at neurology .
0.800000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him.  He has also gone above and beyond in taking care of the rest of my family, including handling a couple of emergency situations wonderfully.
0.280000	I've had many bad persol experiences with physicians in the past. Several have initially denied treatment because they didn't think their patient (my wife) was acting in enough pain for her condition that they eventually correctly diagnosed and medicated. Many have been uble to diagnose fairly common conditions. One LITERALLY told me the video game Street Fighter caused demons to come out of my TV and give me a skin rash that was later properly diagnosed as scabies. That is not a joke, or me having a go at the survey. That actually happened. Many doctors only seem to care about money, many don't care about their patients. I have had a few positive experiences as well, but as I lack a permanent primary care physician I've not had many positive experiences.
0.680000	My doctor is great and I trust him and his judgement. However, I always verify things for myself and do my own research as my doctor can never have the knowledge of my health history that I do - so he might miss something. 
0.760000	My doctor is persoble and down to earth and makes going to the doctor easy. She is also very up front about different options and treatments and doesn't give her own opinion of the product but what might work best for the individual.
0.840000	Generally I always trust people. My doctor cares for me. So I always trust him.
0.560000	I feel that my doctor is generally knowledgeable and competent; I just think that sometimes my sessions are rushed through, as if I'm just another customer to pay for their services. I don't distrust my doctor, but I do often believe that my doctor should spend more time with me.
0.680000	PCP is as good as you tell them your issues. In todays medical world they are more of a gate keeper referring patient to specialist as needed.
0.800000	my doctor is no nonsense and to the point. he does not sugar coat things and has never kept anything from me. trust him implicitly.
0.680000	I trust my pcp because she always take time to make sure I understand and really explains all my options and possible outcomes. 
0.640000	I trust doctors in general, but sometimes if the place is busy I might feel like they don't care very much about me but more about moving to the next person. I don't like it when doctors don't seem to care about a more persol engagement.
0.520000	I think doctors miss a lot of things because they are trained to treat the symptoms and not the causes. They don't often trust that people know their own bodies.
0.400000	I know he receives samples from pharm reps. I also know that is what I'll be walking out of his office with. 
1.000000	My doctor has never wronged me. He is very friendly and always answers my questions. He genuinely cares about my health and his solutions have always worked.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she takes her time when she is seeing me, she is knowledgeable, smart, kind, caring, wants to help me whenever I am sick or need to discuss something with her. She always has my best interest and in mind when she is tending to my health needs.
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I have been going there for some time. They listen to my concerns and thoughts then add their input. If I disagree with something they say they will listen and try to find a better altertive. I do what a doctor tells me is best to do.
0.800000	My doctor doesn't seem like a bad guy. He doesn't push any medicines or products on me, so it doesn't seem like he's benefitting in any way that would make him disregard my care.
0.800000	I pick doctors that really care about good outcomes and satisfied patients. Also, if a doctor gives the hint that he/she isn't doing the right thing I will question and leave if necessary.
0.400000	I feel that medicine is a business and not a one on one profession.   The doctor tries to make money off you.
0.640000	I overall trust my doctor but there is so much information out in the world regarding health and sicknesses and treatments that he couldn't possibly know everything that is best for me.
0.920000	I have had doctors I did not trust, and quickly sought a new doctor. To me, it is one of the most important decisions a person can make. I need to feel they are thorough, caring, and aren't just passing over any concerns I have. If I am unhappy with a doctor, I have no problem asking to see a different one. The one I have now is very caring, compassiote, and listens, even if the appointment takes  a little longer than expected.
0.960000	He's been my doctor for years. Whenever something is wrong, we can general figure out a fix. If there's ever problem we can't work through together, he sends me to a specialist.
0.880000	My primary care physician is kind and answers any questions that I may have. He is also very careful and mostly remembers when I last visit him. I think he cares a lot about his patients.
0.560000	I dont have a strong persol relationship with my doctor so I can't really say that they have my best interest in mind. I'm sure they dont want to actively harm me but I don't know if they really care that much. 
0.800000	He has been a family friend for many years and is always up front and kind about everything. I've never had an issue where he has not been correct about a medical issue. He treats me very professiolly at all times.
0.800000	I've been with my doctor for about 5 years now and she has always taken the time to answer my questions and address any concerns that I have, even taking extra time to figure issues out.
0.600000	idk
0.920000	I trust my Dr because he takes the time to explain things to me and answer any questions I may have.
0.800000	I generally had positive experiences with health care providers. I trust that these people took their education and their training seriously and that they value their job enough to make correct recommendations. I have yet to have any reason to distrust medical professiols.
0.600000	I do trust my PCP.
0.560000	I don't believe I have any serious medical conditions.  My physician doesn't seem too concerned about me.  Some mistakes have been made when I visited him.
0.720000	From my last couple experiences with my doctor I feel that they have my best interests in mind and that they are trying to help me, but I feel they are overworked and sometimes don't have enough time to get to know me.
0.800000	My primary care physician is very friendly and likable. She always makes sure that I feel comfortable and I understand all of my options.
0.640000	Sometimes my doctor doesn't listen to my main concern and instead changes the subject and discusses other things that I didn't come in to discuss that day. 
0.800000	I have been with my primary care physician for five years now and she has always steered me in the right direction. I feel I have total trust in her and always listen to and follow what she says. 
0.240000	Most physicians are time constrained, they do not believe in altertive medicine nor ways to treat problems, they want to prescribe a pill and have you out the door so they can make more money by seeing more patients. 
1.000000	My Primary care physician is very thorough and can recognize the problem very quickly. I have seen her for anything from a serious illness to a fall and she has known what the problem was so soon as I explained to her how I feel and she saw the injury. She has always been correct in her diagnosis and has sent me to great specialists when the need arises.
1.000000	I have been with my PCP for 10 years. I have always felt like I could tell her everything, like being a lesbian and an alcoholic.
0.960000	"Just saw my PA yesterday. Here's what I wrote in the survey sent by the hospital. ""Kandace has literally saved my life. I had an onset of PMDD and was suicidal. Her triage nurse, ncy, took my concerns seriously and got me in within 2 hours. I had untreated lifelong anxiety disorder and had been on five different benzos. Kandace put me on Zoloft and I had peace of mind for the first time in FIFTY years. I had debilitating sinus migraines and she put on Allegra and I haven't had one since. She diagnosed hypothyroidism when I came in bundled up for Antarctica. She has controlled my HBP. She diagnosed a Vitamin D3 deficiency confirmed by blood test. She is simply the best primary care provider I have ever had in my 66 years."""
0.720000	Sometimes the doctor will tell me what i need to do or take, instead of giving me options. I know that he isnt always right all the time, so that makes me question him.
0.720000	My primary care physician hasn't given me any reason to think he has ulterior motives. He has been pretty spot on every time I have seen him so I will continue to trust his judgement.
0.760000	She listens to what I say, she remembers or has notes about my concerns from previous visits (such as disdain for taking drugs).  Sometimes I wish she was a bit more firm with me about things like my weight, etc.
0.560000	I trust him for the most part. But, even he can have gaps in knowledge and is perhaps more wanting to do the expedient thing than the most thorough. 
0.880000	She is intelligent and asks thorough questions.  She is good at following up.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because in the past he has never gave me any reason to doubt him. Every time I've came in with a question or concern, he's spent the time to sit down with me and address all of my concerns. He's never tried to rush me me out or just disregard me. I am very comfortable around him, and would go to him about any medical concern I had.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because I have seen her for a long time now and she has never let me down. She's always helpful, always within reach, and she has never given me bad advice. I trust her because I consider her a friend and she feels the same way.
0.800000	Because I have been able to talk to him like a person - without it feeling like a judgment.
1.000000	If I didn't completely trust her, she wouldn't be my PCP.  Health care is too important to leave in the hands of someone I don't trust and/or cannot communicate with.
0.640000	I have only gone to my primary care physician for about a year now and hadn't had one before that for 20 years. So far he has given me no reason to distrust him and has been open to conversations about various problems. I don't have enough data to have a strong opinion on how trustworthy he is but I am assuming he is.
0.800000	My PCP always sits and listens to me and together we choose an appropriate course of action.  She explains anything I question.
0.800000	He has dedicated his life to helping people with their life. I don't believe he would lie to me. I believe he always has my best interests in mind and gives me the truth.
0.800000	I have been going to my doctor since I was little and he knows me and my family well. I trust in what he says and does to treat my ailments.
0.800000	I have only know my newest primary care physician for about 6 months. My past primary care physician was used for almost a decade. I believe a relationship with a doctor is important. I'm not saying that will not develop with my newest doctor, but at the time total trust is not present. 
0.720000	My primary care physician has been generally thorough and helpful, and when he says something is wrong he is very thorough in providing me with all of the information about treatment options available to me. However, I answered neutral for some of my responses because there was a time when I had a lot of non-specific symptoms and eventually began having a lot of pain, and he did not look much further into it and prescribed me muscle relaxers. I visited again and his PA took the time to do a full examition and determined based on my pain that I had fibromyalgia, which also explained many of my other nonspecific symptoms. In this case, I don't believe my PCP was as thorough during the visits I made to him because he didn't discuss this possibility with me. 
0.920000	I trust mines because I have not experience anything that went wrong as of yet.
0.800000	I generally trust doctors and trust their professiolism most of all. I think they have more insight and I don't feel like I have to challenge it or anything like that.
0.480000	Doctors are fallible human beings, no different than you or I and they can, and do make mistakes.  What is in their best interest may not be in yours as well.
0.560000	I wouldn't trust a doctor 100%, I would seek a 2nd opinion if there was ever a serious matter. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they seem trustworthy and have had more experience than me.
0.520000	I don't trust any doctors anymore. I have seen so many that are not involved in my care as I feel they should be. I like my doctor now but I don't trust him.
0.960000	I have known my doctor for years and he has always been good to me. I haven't ever had a reason to stop trusting him.
0.760000	My doctor usually gives me the news straight and goes over treatment plans.  I have seen my health improve in the last 2 years since going to this doctor so I trust future advise he gives me. 
0.320000	If I'm asked about symptoms, I can barely finish a sentence before he just blurts out some answer. After that he's very dismissive of questions. I might get a printout with s cursory explation of what's going on.
0.320000	I don't care for my primary car physician. I feel like I am just a number as she quickly would complete my visit and rarely answer questions. When I truly had a need she didn't have any advice for me and didn't offer to converse with her colleagues to find out.She also didn't listen to me and caused me several scares during my first pregncy. I haven't seen my PCP in 6 years because of it. 
0.760000	I believe my doctor is looking out for my best interest, that being said he is only human and is prone to making mistakes like everyone else. But deep down I do think he cares about my well-being.
0.840000	I trust a doctor to know more about what is wrong when it is an infection or severe injury. Mild injuries including soreness and stitches have had moderately incorrect diagnoses. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I've never been given a reason not to. They are the medical professiols with years of training and education and I should defer to their recommendations unless they give me a reason not to trust them.
0.360000	My doctor does not make me feel like they have my best interest fully at heart because the last time I went in for an ongoing, painful issue they ran tests and told me that they did not know what was wrong, that was it. No further follow up to figure out what the problem was. 
0.680000	They seem to worry about other issues when I go to see them. I went for a sore throat and end up getting a test for something else.
1.000000	I have had the same primary care doctor for over 10 years. She is very thorough and explains her reasoning for any medication that she prescribes. She listens and pays attention to what I have to say.
0.840000	I feel that my doctor-patient relationship is well established and she feels comfortable telling me things even if I won't agree with them. She is aware I will ask questions and I will always be respectful even if I disagree with her recommendation. 
0.640000	I generally trust my doctor. I have been with him for years and would not continue the relationship if I had doubts about his care. When it comes to my health I am somewhat cautious so I do not completely trust my doctor.
0.720000	I do trust my primary care physician or else I would be choosing another physician.  I am also aware that physicians are busy and that sometimes things can get missed in a busy office so it is my responsibility to keep myself well-informed regarding tests, results and treatments and to ask questions if needed.  
0.680000	I would like to think that doctors have the patients best interest at heart. I would also think that they have seen many cases of certain illnesses and have  lots of experience in dealing with the problem. However, sometimes, I think that a doctor can have ulterior motives but most likely not.
1.000000	I have been seeing my current doctor for nearly 2 years, but my experience with doctors in general is very consistent. Every time I have a question about my overall health or a specific condition, my doctor is able to clearly explain his thoughts on the matter. 
0.920000	My doctor does not dance around subjects and outright tells me what is wrong and how or why I should fix things if they need medical attention. 
0.480000	Everyone I go in with a concern I get a few words in  then suddenly there is medicine without test..
0.640000	I have a new doctor and he seems fine. So far he persoble and seems knowledgeable. I hope over time he will be a good choice.
0.600000	I believe that some doctors pay attention to you, but some do not. My current doctor i don't believe listens to me. When i first was going through menopause i felt like i was going crazy to have some much anxiety. He was a young doctor and i felt like he was looking at me like i just wanted drugs. He never explained to me all that goes along with menopause.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he is always blunt and honest. If I'm doing something to cause the issue he will tell me, and he gives me realistic ideas of the end results or recovery time. 
0.640000	My doctor is usually very good at explaining the mechanisms behind any diagnosis she give. But, when I got bloodwork done she completely overlooked something that has been shown to give symptoms that I was having. She immediately prescribed medication rather than trying to find out what the cause of my abnormal bloodwork was.
0.920000	I don't feel like he pushes medication on me, which is a fear I have regarding most doctors. I don't want a doctor who is in the pocket of Big Pharma. 
0.840000	"I trust my doctor because he is very direct and ""no-nonsense"".  He explains things very clearly and presents me with options."
0.960000	My PCP is a former Director of the CDC and is a Board Member of the American Cancer Society.  His experience, knowledge and wisdom, associated with viral infections and Cancer, have proven to be a profound blessing.  Also, his associates and other specialists work well as a team when preparing my treatment plans, explaining all of the parameters associated with them, and carrying them out.
0.560000	I have had hard to diagnosis conditions in the past and because I go to a large HMO where the doctors have a huge client load, I feel that there is no way that a doctor can adequately diagnosis this type of condition. After a doctor's appointment, I often combine research that I've done online with what they say or prescribe. 
0.760000	They have never given me a reason not to trust them and everything they've ever done for me worked out well. I also generally agree with the treatment or advice they give me too.
0.960000	I trust my primary care doctor because he is patient with me, listens to all I have to say and consults with me regarding his decisions.  He has very well trained office staff that provide excellent services.
0.880000	I trust my primary physician based on how he has helped me in the past. He is always thorough and I went through other doctors before sticking with him. He always explains the options and when possible, we decide things together.
0.280000	I will never trust anything in this medical system ever again. It is as simple as that.
0.520000	I have always felt rushed and just another number when going to the doctor. I have also been shamed by a few doctors for carrying some extra weight. Overweight people know they are heavy and need kind and conpassiote care, not being lectured to. 
0.560000	Sometimes I think she doesn't listen to all my concerns or tries to easily explain away or dismiss my concerns.  I would like for her to try to resolve each issue and not blow me off.
0.680000	Sometimes they don't listen to everything I need to tell them, and they come to a conclusion/diagnosis before I tell them everything I'm experiencing. Sometimes I'm left with some concerns. However, I generally trust their judgment.
1.000000	My primary care physician is always patient with me and does not seem rushed. He is very clear in his explations of his diagnosis and how to move forward no matter the issue. He is able to provide trustworthy and good recommendations in my experience. 
0.560000	I rarely go to the doctor, and in fact, don't really have one that I would call my primary.  When I do go, though, it is usually for a specific issue, sickness, or injury and I always have the feeling the doctor just wants to get me in and out so he or she can get on to the next one.  I rarely feel like they have my best interest at heart.
0.480000	My doctor is the same doctor I had as a kid.  He is super Christian and super American.  I haven't been to see him in over 10 years because he always wants to talk to me about Jesus and democracy.
0.800000	Docs are only human, by definition they are not perfect.
0.840000	My primary care physician actually listens to me, takes the time to hear and understand my concerns, and is willing to explore alterte treatment options er provide referrals to other specialists if we agree there may be some benefit.
0.440000	Almost all drs in this country have to follow the deranged findings of the government and the funding of the drug companies. 
0.800000	I generally trust my doctor since I switched to him after having a bad experience with a previous doctor, and my current doctor was very honest in giving me new treatment options. He is very good at communication and seems to listen very closely and with interest in what I say. 
0.840000	My primary care physician is my uncle, so I've known him my entire life and certainly do not think he'd put any concerns above my health. Also because he's a family member I've had lots of people approach me who are patients of his to tell me how much they trust him as well. As a doctor, he's both extremely careful and reassuring, and very experienced.
0.360000	"I receive medical treatment through a public health service. These people are over worked, under paid, and emotiolly drained. They have no incentive nor energy to deal with people who are uncooperative, and thus will try to give few options that leave people with ""obvious"" choices. "
0.600000	Well, I marked neutral on all these because my PCP has only been with me 4 months. If i don't believe in my doctor or the doctor doesn't have faith in me about fixing things with a diet and exercise they get the boot. If they don't listen to me or make me feel ignored they get the boot.  So far I like him and he is  being a cheerleader for me 
1.000000	My doctor is very open and honest with me. He never rushed me, answers all of my questions. He goes above and beyond by calling and checking on me. He is very genuine in his treatment.
0.640000	Physicians are people and they make mistakes. They can be persuaded with money and gifts to be biased towards certain treatments. They can have fincial interests that bias them towards treatments, too.
0.760000	My primary care physician is very forward with information and makes sure I understand everything he tells me. He is very open to questions and is very considerate.
0.400000	I don't have a primary physician, but I feel that overall, doctors are more concerned about the bottom line than the patients. In the past, I have been prescribed medicine I don't need for a condition I don't have, just because the physician I was seeing was paid to do so by the pharmaceutical companies. I don't feel that doctors really listen to their patients. 
0.560000	I believe doctors in general want money. I think they make stuff up to scare you.
1.000000	My family doctor has always treated us great including my two year old child with a serious heart disease and if it weren't for them we may have found out about her disease in the worst way possible which would be finding her dead. My doctor gives it to me straight and certainly does not sugarcoat anything which is good considering I am obese.
0.520000	In my experience, doctors tend care less about their patients if their patients have free health care. When I did, the doctor I had kept trying to convince me to get as few tests done as possible, and never told me the results of those tests. Whereas if I had been paying out of pocket or had really good insurance, they probably would have given me every test in the book whether I asked for it or not. They have also been far too dismissive. When I go to a doctor, I want to know if a problem is real or in my head. If the doctor says there's nothing physically wrong with me, then that gives me a way to understand what's going on with me. But a doctor that refuses to help is a pointless doctor to spend your time and money on.
0.760000	Just his general presence and how he is willing to explain everything in detail and will allow extra time in appointments to go over any concerns I may have.
0.960000	I trust them because they committed to very many years of schooling to do what they do. They're trained in their profession and do it nearly every day which quickly builds experience. The most experience I have is Google searches so I have no choice but to put my trust in them.
0.600000	I trust them nbecasue they are professiols. I am going there because I value their opinions and trust them whole heartedly.
0.640000	I believe that for the most part physicians have their patients' best interests in mind. However, because of the economics of healthcare in this country a patient's interests might not always be met.
0.880000	I have been seeing the same doctor since I was a young adult, he's always been kind, and comes of caring and astute. My doctor has never given me a reason to question his decisions. 
0.640000	I don't fully trust doctors in general because I've had bad experiences with them in the past. I feel like the process to become a doctor 1lpeople who actually care from completing it, and a lot of doctors I've met are self centered and see patients as puzzles instead of real people.
0.800000	my doctor hasn't given me any reason to doubt his thoroughness, especially since i follow up his treatment with my own research on other treatments and medicines.
0.440000	I believe after being in a practice for a long time, everything is routine. I don't feel like they give as much thought into my complaints as they should. I don't go into the doctor for any old little thing, if I go, I am severely concerned. Their concern never matches my concern.
0.400000	I recently encounter a medical situation in which most of the problem was created by doctors non-expertise in that area. 
0.520000	I've had 2 doctors in my life give me bad information.  So, I'm a little weary. I had one the was obviously getting paid to prescribe a certain pill and he pushed it hard on me.  When I got my second opinion the Doctor told me I didn't need pills.  I do think Doctors know way more than me but I'm cautious now with them. 
0.760000	I like her a lot and she hasn't steered me wrong so far.  I feel like she's honest with me about her opinions and my options.
1.000000	My doctor is the first one to listen to me when I told him my antidepressants were making my feet and legs stay swollen and also it was causing me to shake a lot when I got hungry.  He took me off the immediately and then gave me the option of trying to survive without them or going on another type.  We worked together to get me off of both of them.  He also listened to my issue about sleep apnea and got me tested and approved for a corrective surgery.
0.600000	I have felt rushed in the examition room, even though my doctor was kind. I was also prescribed something and told it wouldn't affect my mood at all. In fact it made me extremely anxious, and the research I did on my own, after the fact, cautioned that it would.
0.760000	I've been with my doctor for many years now and have had no issues with her. She is very nice and I do trust her very much. That said on a big medical decision I may get a second opinion.
0.320000	Doctors are only interested in what your insurance can cover-period! It's very difficult to find a decent doctor who will consider what is best for the patient and sometimes their treatment is worst than the decease itself!
0.680000	My PCP usually addresses all of my concerns, and will triage them accordingly. He's also cared for me during some more recent, complicated health issues, so I trust he knows my health concerns just as well as I do.
0.760000	He's been my doctor since I was a teeger. He is pretty blunt about telling you what is going and why. He is pretty thorough in his questions too. But if you smoke or anything, he'll tell you to expect a stroke.
0.520000	My primary care physician did not build a good rapport with me. I felt like, if I had to bring my child to an appointment, she cared more about holding my baby than caring for me
0.320000	"My PCP is worthless. i have been going there for 5 years, sick as a dog, and he keeps telling me I am ""healthy as a horse"" on paper. Just great.  I am in the process of finding another doctor before i croak."
0.840000	My doctor tells me like it is. She's honest and thorough with me. She tries to relate to me. And speaks to me in a way I would understand.
0.800000	I DO TRUST MY NEW DOCTOR.  SHE IS RIGHT TO THE POINT ABOUT THINGS.  SHE TELLS YOU WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND TELLS YOU HOW SHE FEELS WHEN YOU DON'T DO IT.  SHE HOLDS NOTHING BACK.  SHE HASN'T LET ME DOWN AS OF YET.  
0.800000	If I didn't trust my PCP then I would look elsewhere (as I have done in the past). One of the most important aspects of a PCP is trust. If I can't trust him/her then the relationship is worthless to me.
0.440000	Hes there to make money.  He has his own agenda, and sometimes I feel like he ends up only doing the least amount to help me so I will  have to come in again so he can make more money off of me.
0.840000	My doctor has always had my trust and has not failed me yet. So I have no reason not to trust him.
0.720000	I feel that with my interactions with my primary care physician he shows a good amount of concern for my well being. I trust him because he gives me all the information I need to make a decision and gives me his opinions and experience to help me.
0.600000	"I have not seen this primary care physician that long and feel that they aren't as familiar with my background as they could be. I have also been denied certain medications that I feel I need just because they ""are not comfortable"" with prescribing them. I would have to go to a different doctor just for that then. I miss my ""old familiar with me"" doctor as well."
1.000000	I trust that my doctor knows what is best for me. If he tells me something I have a disagreement on, I question his logic. I know my body pretty well and he knows that I give him all the information he needs to make a decision about treatment. I don't hold back and he doesn't either. 
0.800000	She takes the time to really understand what is happening and asks thoughtful questions to provide better health treatment without making you feel guilty about how you responded to her. She makes thoughtful suggestions without coming off as pushy or judgemental.
0.760000	
0.720000	It's not that I don't trust them it's they always seem to have altertive agendas then what you feel you need. You go in for one thing and they test you for eight other things, they find out what's wrong and then they experiment with different medicines. 
0.480000	I don't completely trust my doctor because in the past they regularly suggest things that aren't necessary, but that are extremely expensive. They seem to have no understanding that not everyone can afford anything they want. They act like money is no object. I don't think they're looking out for my best interest.
0.920000	If my primary care physician see that his way is not working he will send me to another doctor , he will explain every thing to me , sometimes draws pictures and shows me how something will work , he takes his time with me and make sure I know what is going to happen 
0.840000	I've been with my primary care physician for several years, and we have a good relationship. I feel like my physician is open and forthcoming with me, and I feel like I can be as well in return.
0.320000	Every single person in my family has trusted their doctor and ended up worse off for it. That is, except for surgeons. I never really have a need to go to a doctor, but I've been to a few dentists, one of which was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Filling fell out within days and their work was extremely sub-par. I had to go to a different dentist to get it fixed which cost me quite a bit. I've been with my significant other when she has went to her doctor and they literally googled symptoms. Yeah, I don't have a lot of faith in GP's. 
0.760000	For the most part, I trust physicians but I do believe in getting a second opinion where treatment for cronic health issues are concerned. I saw both of my grandparents almost die because of a doctor who was more concerned with his bottom line than caring for what they needed. They were heavily over medicated and taking medicine they did not need. They were both in need of a pacemaker but he would not refer them to a cardiologist. The family had to take over and get them to different doctors so that they could have a healthy life instead of slowly wasting away.
0.600000	I feel as if some times my doctor is not listening to my whole story. I try to say something and it is sometimes disregarded when I believe it would be important to take into consideration.
0.920000	My doctor explains everything to me and then presents options for me to choose from. This creates a relationship where I trust her. She is providing me with the opportunity to be involved in my healthcare decisions instead of being extremely paterlistic and telling me what I should and should not be doing.
0.880000	I have had the same doctor all of my life and rely on them to make sure I feel good in all situations.  I believe that normally all people are in this world to do good, especially doctors as I know they are there to look out for people.
0.760000	He's been my primary doctor for years already and his cure is always effective.
0.800000	because my doctor will always give me choices and will always be honest with me. He will advise me on what to take and what not to take .
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician due to actually taking the time to listen to what I am saying and talking with me about what the right path is for me.
0.480000	I don't think MDs know all of the options for treatment and, therefore, always recommend the options that they are most familiar with or have the latest buzz in jourls or commercials or get the best meals from the local sales representative. They are human and they habits and are easily influenced.
0.760000	I normally trust them as I have high hopes and respect to them.I know if they were fooling me because I can somehow sense it. And i always asked my sister about it.
0.680000	I do not fully trust anyone completely, even a doctor. I always have a sense of questioning about what if. No one is perfect and even doctors make errors or are wrong.
0.760000	I generally trust my doctor.  If I had doubts, I would seek a second opinion. My doctor has many years experience and I am generally in excellent health.
1.000000	I have known him for quite awhile.  he is well respected and has an excellent reputation.  He always takes time to talk with me and address any concerns that i might have. 
0.400000	A lot of doctors see too many patients to be very through with each patient, which I fault health insurance companies for the doctors needing to see so many patients. I was prescribed a medication that could interact with another medication I was taking. I took that medication for months, seeing the same doctors and using the same pharmacy. It wasn't until my regular doctor (pain magement) was on vacation, an older doctor recognized the risk and took me off of it. This greatly reduced my amount of trust in both doctors and pharmacists. My PCP was also aware of the medications but, did not recognize the interaction. 
0.560000	I feel my PCP sometimes rushes through appointments. Plus they are handcuffed by what my insurance allows them to do. 
0.600000	they do not want to see you back again in a few weeks so they are inclined to give you better treatment. 
0.800000	My doctor never seems to be hurried and answers all of my questions in depth.
0.360000	I typically do not trust doctors. They seem to be rushed and not look at people's problems as a whole. I hate when doctors only want to look at one problem that you have and not look at your body as a whole.
0.840000	I never trust anyone completely, however I truly believe that most doctors are truthful and honest or the most part when talking to the clients
0.520000	My last primary care physician wasn't necessarily a bad doctor, but she was pretty busy and quick to get my appointments over with. She even ended up missing key signs of a very serious problem I was having by diagnosing the symptoms as common ailments that had nothing to do with each other though she's not to blame for that (it was a very bizarre chain of events that led to the discovery of my problems). I know she did what she could with what she knew but I think if she spent more time with me in my appointments, maybe she would have seen something different.
0.800000	My primary care physician is very thorough in explaining things and likes to make sure I understand what she has told me before the visit ends. 
0.640000	They didn't go to school that long and learn nothing
0.720000	I'm in between PCPs (switched insurance based on marriage). I answered the questions based on my last one, who was a resident, fresh out of med school. She would take a lot of time to talk with me about issues, but more for herself/understanding things. She referred me to a dermatologist for an issue I still have, and I completely mistrusted the derm because he wanted me on 4 medications for something simple, even after I told him none of them worked in the past. This made me not want to trust my old PCP in her referral judgement.
0.560000	"I haven't had a primary care doctor for years because I'm poor and couldn't afford to go to doctors, but I did go to the emergency room a few years ago and that doctor totally ripped me off. I had a sty bleeding wound on my eyebrow. The doctor glued it back together, gave me 2 Tylenols, and a tetanus shot. All of that cost almost $2000. You can explain it to me a million ways but there's no way those actions cost $2000. It took the doctor 5 minutes and the bill said that the ""physician fee"" or whatever it was called was $800. They charged me $10 a piece for the 2 Tylenols. All some of these medical people care about is money. It may have once been a noble profession but now they're just as crassly capitalistic as any other big business in this country."
1.000000	I have been seeing my doctor for almost 20 years now. He knows me and I feel like I am at home there. I can come to him with any problem at all and he knows what to do. He has never let me down once. He know when we can speed through and exam but if I have any questions or need to talk he will stay with me as long as I need him to explain or talk to me.
0.560000	She put me on a medication and took me off another cold turkey and I developed serotonin syndrome which has completely turned my life upside down.
0.640000	I feel like the time spent with me is probably not enough to accurately diagnose and help. I think my doctor has good intentions, and is very knowledgeable, but probably too busy. 
0.880000	I answered this about my mother's main surgeon. He removed her colon, ovaries, uterus, gallbladder, appendix and spleen. We went through four surgeon consults before I found the one we have now. I kept going back to our PCP and getting additiol referrals until I found one I liked. The first four were complete nightmares.They had neither the time or inclition to answer my questions thoroughly and were arrogant. I refuse to accept sub par medical care. I think hospitalists should get with the program and understand that their patients are CONSUMERS and while they are selling a highly specialized product, they do not have a monopoly.
0.800000	I've been going to her office for a few years now and I'm always impressed by her high intelligence, her warmth, her competence and professiolism and the way she is always calm, attentive, quick and relaxed at the same time. And she is also greatly regarded in the profession - she has won many awards, which definitely inspires confidence.
1.000000	After a visit I check everything he has told me.
0.560000	I had a wonderful primary care doctor but he had since retired due to too much paper work involved in the practice. For the time being, I don't have a primary doctor. However, I come in contact with different doctors. Many are good, normal people. They do their best to treat patients with their specialized knowledge that they spent years to acquire. At the same time, they are just humans and could only do so much to treat patients. 
1.000000	I trust what my Doctor tells me as I have been a patient of hers for a number of years. 
0.720000	I trust them but not one hundred percent. The reason its not 100 percent is due to the fact that I feel they are in bed with big pharma. They are always trying to get you to take some sort of pill. Thats why I dont trust them completely. They at times seem to have ulterior motives with these pills. They wont hurt you, just push them like dealers. 
0.960000	They spent years learning their practice so I should be able to trust them.
0.800000	I trust my physician because she is caring and honest. She is open and you can talk to her about any of your health concern and she will give her honest advice on what should or shouldn't be done. 
0.880000	I trust doctors to know what's best for patients because they have the required knowledge and training to diagnose these problems and provide accurate information to help solve issues.
0.520000	I don't completely trust my pcp. It often seems that if they don't properly diagnose a condition the first time, that they want to blame the patient instead of looking further to figure out exactly what the problem is. I feel like a lot of the time, they can't be bothered to listen, because in their minds, they've already decided what the truth is. 
0.520000	Sometimes doctors don't have the patients best interest in mind.
0.920000	My physician is very though and takes the time to explain things to me. And he shows patients and eager to answer all my questions. And makes sure that I completely understand before I leave his office. He always make sure we have a plan and a time when we will follow up.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he does not beat around the bush. He tells me when I need to address something or if I am over reacting. He also tells me to not be afraid to get a second opinion. That he is only human and that he wants me to feel comfortable and if that means getting another doctor's opinion then so be it. 
1.000000	I do trust my doctor.  He is very kind and thoughtful.  If I do not want to have an x-ray done, he does not force me to have it done.  He always asks me how I am feeling and if I have any questions and concerns that he can help me with.
0.960000	I trust him b/c he has proven that he cares and wants to find out what is wrong with me no matter what.  
0.840000	I have complete in my doctor, Ihave been seeing her for quite sometime, She always give the best treatment , So for she have taken good care of me.
0.560000	I generally think he is honest and trying hard but I don't think he is a very good communicator and sometimes it feels like he is hard to read. I don't always know how urgent or serious something is.
0.440000	I think that a lot of doctors would rather have you get on some medication that might help you some, but would cause side effects that would make you have to continue going to the doctor, rather than really emphasize the importance of changing the things that people eat, so I don't trust them too much in that regard.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he is very knowledgeable in his job and knows what he is doing and what is best for me to do and take.
0.920000	I believe my doctor take the time to give the most important information and take time to explain things to me. And will route me to additiol sources so I trust her over all.
0.520000	I have no primary care physician now. Dealing with doctors in the past is the main reason I don't bother with them. I found them to rarely be good listeners. They are too concerned with covering their own ass these days than actually taking care of people.
0.800000	My doctor takes his time and does not rush. He gives me many options for treatment and often asks for my preferences and input.
0.640000	I feel that because I am not diagnosed with detrimental medical conditions my doctor has less regard over optiol treatments for a condition. I have some regard for their opinions, but am not fine with the cost of some prescriptions written for my treatment.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because the things that he has suggested to me regarding my health have always helped me. My doctor is patient and listens to me when I have questions.
0.800000	Although my PCP is fairly new to me (&gt;then one year) he quickly takes action on long term conditions I explain and gets me into the correct specialist if he is uble to provide treatment.  He listens well, asks about previous experiences, explains his ratiol and appears to be transparent in his thought process.
0.720000	I am lucky to have a great Dr. In the past, I have not. She listens. She knows me. She also has chronic pain, so that helps in her understanding.
0.800000	They listen and are observant. They care.
0.560000	I distrust western medicine in general. I feel it is a business more than anything else these days. I also feel it is ignorant about the conscious ture of the universe.
0.840000	My primary care physician is direct to the point, and makes sure you understand what is going on.
0.880000	I completely trust my doctor to give me correct, accurate and complete information and not mislead me.  But I don't fully trust that my doctor knows which medical treatments are best for me.  I take the information they give me and I do my own research and I make my own decisions taking into consideration what my doctor has told me.  I am neutral that my doctor knows what's best for me.  
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I feel he genuinely wants to help. Whenever I seek him, he would give me all sorts of reasoble suggestions to help improve my health, responds to email, etc.
1.000000	I trust my doctor will always do whats in my best interests.  They have the expertise that I lack.  I trust that they have seen similar cases and can react accordingly.
0.480000	I believe doctors are mostly concerned with selling drugs to patients. Their main concern is treating symptoms, not the actual disease. Sometimes they spend just a few minutes with each patient, people get more attention at the mechanic .
0.800000	"In the past, I did not trust doctors much due to some bad experiences with being brushed off and accused of ""looking for attention"".  I have since dealt with two very nice doctors, both of which were easy to deal with and took me seriously.  They talk to me and help me through issues, explaining everything as necessary.  "
0.200000	Every time I go to the doctor they seem to be in a bad mood. I don't quite know but their face is always that of a person when they are angry and do not want to be bothered. This leads me to not ask any questions about how I feel health-wise. I end up leaving without getting the input I need most of the time.
0.280000	The physician and doctors in general come across as rushed and that they have no desire or time to truly help.
0.760000	I've been going to my doctor for over 20 years.  He knows my history and persolity.  I can talk honestly with him and he'll have an engaging conversation.
0.680000	I do trust my doctor most of the time. But he only knows what the AMA has taught him. Medicine is centered around prescription medications and most, if not all, the time I believe there is a better tural solution. 
0.760000	I have had my doctor for a long time and she knows my history well. She also knows I prefer tural treatments and to monitor things instead of masking with pills etc. Because we have established a good rapport I do trust her when I need to make decisions about my health.
0.440000	It seems to me that more and more doctors are spread too thin in their practice having to see a maximum number of patients in as little time as possible, creating a less thorough exam or alysis of symptoms/ testing.
0.800000	For the most part, I trust my primary care physician. I've seen doctor's before where they felt almost robotic in dealing with me. No emotion whatsoever and looked to have one foot out the door already. My current primary care physician is none of those things. It actually feels like he cares about my well being. He remembers things from my persol life in previous conversations and brings it up when I see him, like a human being. He takes the time to deal with me, which I like.
0.720000	I'm not a very trusting person in general which is why I answered as I did, but I trust my pcp as much as I trust as anyone. 
0.640000	In general, I would trust my doctor to recommend what he honestly believes is the best medical advice for me. However, I have done a fair amount of research and reading regarding certain health issues, and in general I don't trust the medical community to always have the best or most up-to-date information on some issues, particularly regarding nutrition and diet. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor in that he has answered all my questions and has been right about everything I have asked, especially in regards to my own research about issues or topics I bring up to him.  The is a little distrust which is by my own doing in that I don't feel I can trust someone 100% without multiple opinions should something serious happen to my health.
0.720000	I spent time finding my primary care,  he's someone that is not overly difficult to talk to and has helped me with issues I previously was uncomfortable with other doctors.  He always gives me many options for medication with the materials to study them. 
0.800000	I do trust my doctor for the most part.  I know that not a lot of doctors study nutrition or altertive forms of medicine so I also study on that to and make my own decisions.  My doctor is very thorough and seems to care about me.  I feel comfortable talking to her.
0.960000	I have been his patient for several years.  My entire family is a patient AND there have been instances where i have requested weight loss drugs and he has refused to prescribe to me as they had adverse effects.  I trust him and his judgement completely and really do believe that for him, patients come first.
0.440000	Too many doctors follow a set of rules and protocol. They are not open to altertive medicine and would sooner give you medicine than try and treat things turally. They have too much at stake with the pharmaceutical companies.  
0.680000	I never trust a doctor 100%. I JUST got a new doctor, and I was happy with him when I went to have a physical back in November.  I like his temperament, his openness to listen, he followed up when he promised that he would, his staff was friendly and so was he.  He looks at things from multiple views.
0.680000	I don't necessarily trust nor distrust the doctor.  I would assume I trust them more than distrust because she has been trained to be a doctor.
0.640000	It's not that I distrust my physician, it's that I distrust the medical establishment, to include govt intervention.  I trust that my physician is doing the best she can with the training provided by the medical establishment.  The reason I distrust the establishment is due to its record.   Food pyramid, dietary cholesterol, fats are bad, massive numbers of people on statins with no resulting drops in CVD related deaths.
0.800000	My primary care physician is a human being. He sometimes has some mistake but I trust him
0.760000	I trust my doctors advice on care because I am a relatively healthy male with no preexisting conditions.  I only usually go see the doctor when I am really sick.
0.600000	I stay in the middle when it comes to trust.  I trust their opinion, but they are still motivated by self interests first.
0.760000	I believe you have to trust them. If I'm not mistaken they sign some oath to verify they will be honest and forthright with patients, and do what's in there best interest.  Also they make good money, and if it was found out they were being deceitful it would be hard for them to find work.
0.800000	She never seems rushed with me, and she will always take the time to research an issue to make sure she's considered every possible solution. There was a time when I felt her treatment recommendation was too drastic, but she had no problem referring me to a specialist.
0.800000	My doctor seems to genuinely care about her job. She seems worried and really listening when I am telling her my problems. Then I can tell she is thinking hard and trying to help me to a solution.
0.800000	We are very direct with each other. He doesn't  beat around the bush and makes suggestions and recommendations. I make the decisions, with his input. He doesn't always agree, but hey, I pay him, he don't pay me. He is not my boss. 
0.920000	I have had a good relationship with him in the past. I feel like he would tell me the truth about any potential diagnosis. He has given me reason to believe that he would not falsely lead me on with some diagnosis or other.
0.640000	i trust my doctor 
0.800000	I generally trust doctors and I never asked for a second medical opinion (unless I noticed that they had a bad attitude towards me and towards other people in general).
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she feels that if I am able to get healthy without prescription drugs, that is the best route. That is respectable to me since most doctors just want to push pills.
0.760000	In general, as doctors have years of training to understand medical knowledge and how to apply it, I trust their judgement.
0.800000	My primary care physician has my best interests and health in mind. He has always chosen the best options for the sicknesses that I had and brought me back to good health. I trust in his opinion and his explations of the issues that I deal with.
0.400000	I have seen many relatives have horrible doctors who could really care less about their well being. It was like the only good they were was for the diagnosis. I have had a few like that as well. 
0.600000	Physicians are so busy I feel like they do not always take the time to fully listen and give all options. I trust that they would not put me in harm but I don't trust that I'm always given all available options. They are also highly restricted by insurance companies drug coverage etc.
0.240000	"The doctor I was seeing was not good at discussing things of importance with me.  Apparently he had too many patients because he left to go be an ""Amway"" doc.  I lost faith in him when I was literally dying and too stupid to realize it one time.  My throat was infected and slowing closing off my air.  I called for an appt on a Monday knowing he was in the office to do paperwork.  Would he see me?  No, he wouldn't.  I didn't think he would because for some reason Monday's are sacred to him.  I saw a perfectly competent doctor who referred me to someone else, a specialist.  But I never saw my doctor and I've always resented that a bit.  I literally was very ill and he could have at least popped his head into the door.  I lost a lot of faith in him after that."
0.360000	I haven't been to a doctor in over a decade. In general I don't trust doctors. Many of them are so profit driven. I hope to never have to see a doctor again.
0.880000	I trust my PCP because she takes her time when evaluating my symptoms or concerns and doesn't try to rush through the evaluation as fast as she can.  She also reminds me of routine tests that I forget to schedule.
0.840000	I trust my physician because they always give me the best treatment options. I can always trust my primary care physician to select the right treatment for me. More importantly, I can trust my physician not to do the wrong things.
0.800000	"I've always had a good experience with my primary care physician. I can understand why some people might have had a bad experience with their persol doctors, but that doesn't mean their experience is the only experience anyone has ever had with doctors - my experience with doctors has certainly been positive. I'm certainly not desperate enough to rely on those ""THINGS DOCTORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" ads, anyways."
0.800000	Because he answers all the questions that I ask, and gives me other altertives if needed.
0.800000	Most of my experiences with doctors have been positive ones.  The exceptions are with two doctors I saw (one time each), who were employed by hotels I work at.  These positions are given to the lowest bidders, and both doctors were somewhat hostile and incompetent.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he cares about my diet. He also encourages me to exercise regularly. He is less likely to prescribe me medicines that I don't need.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician because he is knowledgeable in his field. While I try to gain understanding through probing, I ultimately defer to his knowledge in coming to certain conclusions. Past experience has taught me that he is usually right, so that's another reason I generally trust him.
0.600000	I neither trust or distrust doctors. They seem to be in between when it seems like the really care about their patients or not. I don't see them too often, so I don't know alot about them.
0.400000	"She is young and doesn't really seem to have confidence in things.  I'll tell her my ailments and symptoms, but nothing really comes of it.  She'll prescribe some drug for depression or mood and have me come back in a month.  After a month, I always feel worse and she's just like ""huh""  Seems to me like it's more about getting you a prescription and out the door.  Get us in, prescribed, and out the door as soon as possible.  Who cares about your symptoms, the side effects of this new drug will make you forget about your old symptoms, because the side effects are worse. "
0.920000	My doctor has been a good doctor and I believe he does his job well.
0.800000	She's kind but straight forward and tells me how it is. She listens to my thoughts and concerns. She's never given me a reason to not trust her.
0.520000	My primary care physician has asked me to spell and remind her of the me of my rare condition each of the last four times I have seen her. She has often forgotten or ignored problems I was having. She seems overbooked and scattered. 
0.360000	I just havent had the best physicians. Ive been wrongly diagnosed in the past so there is little trust when it comes to doctors.
0.840000	The doctor I see most often is actually not my primary care doctor. I trust him because he listens to me. I feel like he understands what I'm saying. We make decisions together. It's not like he's telling me what I have to do. So I guess I feel like we collaborate. I'm the one who knows about me, and he's the one who knows about treatments. 
0.800000	I have had a wonderful primary Dr. the last 5 yrs. He looks me in the eyes when I talk and it makes me feel that he is truly hearing me. He asks my opinion on treatment when it's an option. 
0.360000	Sometimes doctors prescribe you medication that you don't really need. They're also more likely to recommend a procedure that costs more. Doctors work to make money, I think there are few doctors who are ethical but most of the ones I've been to are not.
0.480000	I distrust my primary physician because when it comes to giving out medicine these doctors don't know exactly what is in it. So I feel like I should research the stuff my doctor said when I get home and then make a decision myself and talk to my doctor about it.
0.720000	I have used the same doctor for years.  He has always made sure I understand his recommendations/decisions.  I have never had an issue with his performance.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because she has always treated me like a valued individual and explained things to me thoroughly. She is persoble and friendly but also knowledgeable and a fast talker. I really love my doctor.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in depth and uses terms that are understandable. Also she is very comforting and has a good bedside manner.
0.680000	"My primary care doctor is fairly new. She has a new practice and I just signed up for treatment. However, she has not given me any reason to distrust her. For the most part, my trust is rated at ""neutral"" because I just don't have enough experience with her."
0.960000	My primary care physician demonstrates a willingness to listen to my physical and emotiol complaints and can empathize with me.  She demonstrates a level of caring for her patients that I have not seen often in a clinical environment.  She even remembers who I am and what I am dealing with without having to consult my records.
0.400000	My PCP is always trying to push a medication that I don't necessarily need and always jumps to prescribing meds instead of looking for other solutions to a medical problem.  At times they also forget to physically examine me, just simply prescribing a medication.  There are drug information pamphlets all over the office and this puts doubt as to whether my PCP has a conflict of interest or not. 
0.600000	I go to a nurse practitioner at a clinic.  I'm fairly happy with her but not completely.  I don't think they're that thorough and they've made a couple of mistakes in a fairly short time.  I'm considering changing to somewhere else.
0.800000	I generally trust my doctor's years of expertise and practice in the medical field. However, I also know that medicine is not a precise science and that there is still much that is not known about health conditions that afflict the human body. I know that there is always some chance that I may be misdiagnosed no matter how experienced my doctor is. However, overall I feel that my doctor has the wherewithal and the knowledge to give me the treatment that I require. My doctor shows compassion and concern when I visit her and has always answered my questions with clarity.
0.520000	My Doctor is very young and seems to always be in a massive hurry. I just don't feel like he has enough life experience yet to really be able to diagnose to his full potential.
0.560000	In general, doctors aren't perfect, they all make mistakes or misinterpret something on occasion.  In regards to treatments, they may have motivations other than your health, like earning more income or arrangement with a pharmaceutical company to promote a certain product.
0.440000	I do not trust my doctor. It's not that he is a bad guy, but he was taught in school to throw pills at most situations. I would rather take a holistic approach to my healing.
0.880000	I have never had bad experiences with my doctors in the past, so I have no reason to doubt them. most doctors care about their professiol reputation and will not be willing to jeopardize that.
0.800000	I completely trust my primary physician because he is aware of my health issues and can suggest me with good care.I believe Doctors always work for our betterment.After God we have to trust God for cure.
0.800000	When someone goes to a Dr, it's a serious step.  They need to trust what the Dr has to say.  It's ok to ask questions and do independent research.  A Dr should be looked at as part of the team that helps to take care of you.  Ultimately, it resides within each of us to take persol responsibility.
0.560000	I feel like people have flaws just like physicians do. Your doctor is not good at everything therefore could be wrong about things. It is always good to get another opinion
0.680000	Having worked in the medical field for many years I can conclude that sometimes doctors push a certain treatment that may not be the best possible choice for the patient. I understand doctors work directly with pharmaceutical companies whose interest is making money.  
0.720000	While I do trust my doctor in general, I think it's always a good idea to do your own research and educate yourself as well before coming to any fil decisions about anything. 
0.960000	"I trust my doctor to make the right decisions for my persol health.  I have never felt that I was ""putting out"" my doctor by my needs or questions. "
0.960000	She is a very caring doctor and has always been very persoble.  She takes time to talk to me, address any concerns or issues.  She is very thorough and attentive and I feel this is what makes her a great doctor, she likes people and helping.
0.880000	I am uninsured and haven't seen a doctor for 14 months. When I do, I like my doctor very much. He is thoughtful and attentive, speaks in normal civilian language, not medical terms I can't understand. He takes all of the time I need.
0.800000	I trust physicians including mine. I do not think doctors are out to hurt us. I do not think it is likely to have a doctor make a horrible mistake so it is probably best for my health to trust in them. 
0.520000	I think has health care been decentralized and doctor are volunteer at places where health care are provided to those who needs it instead of running a business where hospital choose drugs based on relationship with companies and profit margin, and health care industries has become so large in the United States and it seems to be an ever self revolving perpetual growth by keeping the patient close to insurance and trip to hospitals, in other words, when health care is run as a business with insurance and pharmaceutical drug companies making profit, it is hard to discern whether physician's ethics or the paycheck determine the doctor's action.  And given the high health care cost of United States relative to other country when our health and quality of life is not correspondingly as high in ranking relative to spending, I think doctors, hospitals, are interdependent with insurance and pharmaceutical industries in term of making money.  it is kind of like asking someone whether they want to do something that would pay them double or do something that would reduce cost for patients while cutting their paycheck in half, what is the percentage of people do you think would choose the second option, considering doctors are also human
0.680000	I trust a doctor because they wouldnt have gotten here if they did not do well in medical school. 
0.800000	My doctor never makes me feel rushed. She always makes sure to answer my questions and make me feel involved in deciding my treatment. She makes it seem like we are a team and equals. She tells me about different types of treatments and recommends what will have less strain on my body. 
0.600000	I have had surgery in the past where the doctor told me there were two different options on the way he could perform the procedure.  I told him that I highly preferred the one method and didn't want the other at all.  He chose to do it the way I didn't want because it was easier for him.  Sometimes they don't tell you everything either, if they don't think you can handle it. 
0.520000	I trust that he means well, but I don't trust his ability to see things clearly.  And in general, I think most doctors have too many patients and not enough time to focus on them long enough to really see what might be apparent early, until it's so obvious and too late.
0.520000	I believe that my doctor is competent, but I sometimes feel like he doesn't take me seriously. I have never been harmed by a doctor, but I feel as though a doctor's convenience is more important to them than my preferences. Overall, I would like to be treated with more respect and dignity.
0.880000	I really like my doctor and have been going to her for several years. However, there was one time when she misdiagnosed a problem I was having. Perhaps part of the problem was the way I described the situation. However, she put me on some medication which, after reading about it, I felt wasn't necessary at all. It turned out the problem was with my teeth and a dentist was the appropriate doctor to fix my problem.
0.680000	I trust my doctors advice. He would not take the chance of harming. I take his advice and do as he saya.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he has always been able to treat and cure any ailment that I present to him.  I always wonder if he (or any doctor) is sometimes motivated to recommend treatments that are fincially beneficial to him, however.  I don't believe my doctor has done that with me, but it is always in the back of my mind.
0.560000	I am moderately trusting of my physician, I'm confident there are some motives behind what she recommends that are not 100% in my best interest and I try to be mindful of that.
0.520000	"I have a hard time completely trusting him because sometimes it seems like he just doesn't really care. It seems like he's too willing to write off problems that I'm concerned about as ""probably nothing"". This has happened before with health issues that I ended up seeing other doctors/specialists for (even though he was very reluctant to refer me as he didn't think the issues were real/serious), only to have those specialists confirm that an actual treatable problem existed. He also misdiagnosed me once by saying I probably had bipolar disorder and sending me to a psychiatrist without doing any sort of physical exam or lab testing. I spent two years heavily medicated and miserable before a different doctor realized that the root of my problem was physical/hormol and started to treat me for it. And then all my mental symptoms went away. But he's one of the few doctors in my area who take my insurance, so I don't really have the option to have a different primary doctor. And he does know more than I do, obviously, since he went to medical school. It just seems like he's stretched way too thin and misses a lot of stuff."
0.680000	I trust my doctor implicitly but he has alot of patients and his time is severely limited with each patient. It's the one thing that annoys me. But he is excellent at his practice even if his time magement is lacking. He still mages to be caring and attentive but the rushing in and out does sometimes give me pause.
0.800000	She listens well and I never seem rushed.  She is willing to answer questions and look up information if I ask something specific.  She is persoble and warm.
0.600000	I don't have a primary care physician. I trust doctors because they paid thousands and thousands of dollars to go to school and learn things about medicine that I don't know.
0.880000	I think doctors tend to want what is best for their patients. If I ask enough questions and understand things correctly then I can get a sense of the diagnosis. 
0.600000	I think it is more that I do not trust the time put into me as a patient than that I do not trust my physician.  I worry that my doctor has a busy schedule and because she works for a big company she is required to keep her time with me short.  I do not believe that it is possible to come to correct, well-thought conclusions when you only have 15 to gather information, process it, and explain to the patient.
0.880000	I trust my physician because she has known my family for a long time and I know she would never do anything to double cross us. She is very knowledgable and is always very in depth with her examition of me, which shows that she cares. She speaks to me like a person and makes me feel comfortable, instead of trying to just prove how smart she is like some doctors do.
0.920000	He prescribed medicine that he believed to be helpful, and made sure that I get enough information to use it properly. My doctor cared enough about my condition such that simple follow-up sessions were free. He likes to listen when I ask questions, and makes sure to explain them properly. 
0.760000	Have been seeing the same doctor for longer than I can remember....knows my entire family
0.880000	My old doctor is retiring and the last few times I have had the doctor that will replace her when she retires. He is young but seems competent. I haven't really seen him so often as to really build any kind of relationship with him yet. 
0.800000	I have been seeing the same doctor for ten years and, while I haven't always taken his recommendations, I always know why he offers them. I have implicit trust in his judgement and he never fails to take my concerns into account. 
0.600000	I like my primary care doctor but I don't really see him enough to have perfect trust in him. I see him for maybe 15 minutes once or twice a year. 
0.440000	I persolly have those feelings towards all physicians as well. I also lean more towards altertive medicine.
0.840000	I will only trust them if I have previously dealt with them. It takes a few visits for me to be able to trust in a doctor. I have encountered some that are only in it for the money and do not care about the patients.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. He's certainly smarter than me and I let him know what's going on. I feel like because I'm open and honest with him he's that way with me.
0.360000	I think that they want to do what is best but I also feel with the insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies around that it is hard for them to always do what might be best for the patient. They try to use universal fixes for everyone and instead of fixing the underlying issue they just prescribe medicine which causes more issues.  
0.680000	I mainly trust doctors, but I don't doubt that some of them aren't completely honest. At the end of the day, they are getting a paycheck from sick people.
0.600000	I think doctors tend to rush and don't really go in depth to things to give you all the options. Typically they just give me whatever the most popular treatment is without listing options
1.000000	I have always followed her advice and listened to what she prescribes for me, and I never have an issue. She is smart and very observant. She cares about how she takes care of her patients and she also cares how my other doctors (specialists) are taking care of me.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I have no reason to believe that he is dishonest.   I also have not been misdiagnosed in any way.   The only negative is that he is sometimes very busy and does not spend a lot of time with the patient.  The office is also very quick to push people to specialists.
0.480000	I sometimes trust doctors about certain things, but overall I'm a bit suspicious of healthcare providers in general. I've got friends and family who work in the healthcare industry and they talk about all sorts of shady, crappy things that go on. In addition to the fraud I hear about in the news, and my own negative experiences with doctors, it's difficult for me to take everything they say at face value.
0.400000	I had a new PCP the last time I visited the doctor. I was not pleased with her performance. I am now awaiting an appointment with a new PCP.
0.480000	We have recently moved so I've had to find a new primary care physician and I am having a hard time trusting him.  I have been on several of the same medications for years and years, but a couple of them he is not comfortable with, so he is wanting to change them around even though I have been the most stable on these ones for the longest period of time.  I feel like he doesn't trust what I'm saying, and it doesn't make me feel good.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for many years. He has always been upfront with me and what my options were for that particular ailment.
0.920000	I have been with this doctor for over 10 years and no matter what he always treats me with respect and kindness. I have a lot of faults such as my struggle with my weight and depression and bipolar. He gives me options, but does not shame me. 
0.480000	"I usually have to see a doctor at the E.R. because I have no insurance, so I tend to feel they obviously won't have anything ""persolly invested"" in me as an individual. I think sometimes they just do whatever gets me out of there the fastest, whatever treatment is easiest and quickest. I usually have to remind them to try to keep my lack of income in mind when writing prescriptions and such. This being said, if it is an issue that does not directly involve mental health or drug addiction (these are areas I am knowledgeable about because I have issues relating to these areas), i.e., if it is something I probably don't know much about, I generally trust the doctor because they obviously were smart enough to make it through medical school."
0.280000	i live in a very small town i broke my wrist and was told it was healed after 3 months wearing a cast it was still broken no one here could properly identify the fracture i drove 3 hours to a specialist did an xray and said so yea your wrist is broken and now it's detioriated since its been so long (i walked around with a broken wrist 5 more months before going to a specialist it was hell) so yea i have no faith in medical professiols especially ones in my small secluded town
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor to give me the right advice and do what is best for me rather than just what is more convenient for him. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I feel she's always done great with me as a patient. She's thorough, explains anything I don't understand very well, and is just extremely reliable all and all. I trust her because I've had great past experiences with her.
0.880000	I believe in giving my doctor all the information so as to get the best treatment options.  I trust that my doctor has my best interest at heart and feel she would not purposfully give me bad advice.
0.800000	My primary care physician is always monitoring my results from lab tests and amends my medications accordingly. She is thorough and likes to be one step ahead and is calling me instantly when she sees any information she finds troubling.
0.520000	My doctor and most doctors in general persistently push prescription drugs for every ailment. Any attempt at altertive care is, for the most part, overlooked or brushed off when mentioned. 
0.800000	My doctor is very knowledgeable. On my first visit I kind of tested him by asking a few difficult questions. His answers were beyond my expectations. I have no reservations about trusting him to make wise decisions.
1.000000	My physician is always very transparent with me. She always asks if I have any questions, and she always answers them so that I understand. She never seems in a hurry, and she is always very friendly.
0.800000	I haven't yet run into a doctor that wasn't looking out for my benefit or gave me bad advice. I've heard stories of bad doctors out there who look out for their benefit first, but I've thankfully never ran into one of those doctors myself. Heck, I had surgery a few years back that saved one of my testicles from dying. I think I had something called testicular torsion. Doctor saw what the problem was and gave me the right advice to getting it fixed.
1.000000	Our family has been going to the same doctor for 25 years, we trust him very much. He takes time and explains everything.
0.480000	I trust my PCP because she seems intelligent and seems to care about her patients. But I don't completely trust her since she is human and is very busy. She doesn't have time to be extremely thorough and careful.
0.600000	I like my primary care physician, but I have a certain amount of distrust in doctor's generally and don't trust medications at all. I always prefer to try a drug free option first, and doctor's often aren't on board with that point of view. 
0.600000	my doctor misdiagnosed my low sodium  
0.760000	I trust my doctor because all of the things I have gone in for over the past years have been small and mageable. My doctor is friendly and caring even under time constraints and has been candid but kind in regards to things like getting my weight down, etc. I trust that overall he has my best interest in mind. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has always given me good advice. I have never felt the need to get a second opinion. He takes his time and is thorough.
0.800000	I've had the same doctor for most of my adult life. Any issues I've brought up he treated or ran tests to find out what was going on. He's always taken action on anything I brought up and is great at communicating and returning phone calls. I wouldn't extend blanket trust to all doctors just because they are doctors but i would give them the benefit of the doubt
0.440000	The primary care doctor can't possibly know everything there is to know and keep up with all of the current research. I am also concerned about the conflict of interest between doctors and drug companies. My friend who is a nurse told me she's attended several pharmaceutical company dinners. And the FDA has approved medicines that were upproved years later for being dangerous.
0.760000	I see an endocrinologist every 3 months. I trust him. He is young and seems to be very knowledgeable in my particular health issue. He is not afraid to try new medications to help me and talks in plain English rather than using unfamiliar medical terminology when talking to me. I trust him and he seems to take more time than most at each appt.
0.800000	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a long time. She always explains everything to me in clear, easy to understand way. She thoroughly explains all the options of treatment and suggests the best one for my needs.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I have only had good experiences with them and they always seem to have my best interest in mind. The times that I have had to be given medicine they seem to do a great job of telling me all of the options possible to me and talk with me about the pros and cons of each one. They also seem to be aware of small details that show they have an interest in me. 
0.400000	"I just feel that the doctors are just following what is on the screen or what the head of their department wants. For example in pregncy they do a ""diabetes blood screen"" at 6 months and they make you drink an aweful glucose gmo drink. Now it has come out there are lots and lots of different options of what to drink or even just doing diabetes testing for a few days/week but still the places go ahead and do it because ""protocol"" or like if you have a csection, they force you to a 2nd one or pay extra money to get one with only a few doctors with waiting lists. It's very stressful to have people just blindly following protocol instead of listening to what you need and want and working for you. "
0.720000	My doctor is often in a hurry because he has many patients to see. I always trust he uses his best judgement. I think he makes honest decisions.
0.480000	Last year, a test result showed I had a chronic condition. The only thing the doctor recommended was a prescription medication. That's it, nothing about lifestyle changes, etc.
0.280000	I have been pushed around and lied to in the past by doctors. Doctors do not spend enough time getting to know you or your situation before making a diagnosis and are often wrong. Doctors in general are greedy and care more about money than helping people. 
0.680000	She has shown me that she wants the best for me and my well being
0.560000	I trust him enough I suppose. He's my oncologist I still see once a year. He's a nice guy and everything but he's always busy so when I go there I do all the tests first (CT scan, blood work, etc.) Then he gets all the information before I see him and if no cancer or nothing new that's pretty much it. Usually only see him for 5 minutes or so. But all in all I'm happy with him, I still go there so he must be ok.
0.800000	we have had a long relationship and I have never had any issues with and concerns that have come up with my health that was not resolved.
0.640000	I have taken pre-med courses and have a friend who is a doctor.  Sometimes I think that's why I'm not as blindly confident when it comes to healthcare in general.  Doctor's make mistakes.  It is up to me ultimately to make the decisions about my own healthcare, given a doctor's guidance.
0.920000	I trust my doctor.  He is always very open about all my options and is willing to help me.  He always treats me like family and sometimes even calls to check up on me.  I believe he really does have my best interest at heart. 
0.960000	I have been seeing this doctor for several years.  He is very professiol, approachable and friendly.  He also has very good reviews from other patients. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor. However in the modern world, science is just one more are of Leftist rrative making. I am mindful when researching that doctors and scientists have an agenda which is certainly not truth. For example: Climate Science, Bill Nye, Neil Tyson, when people talk about settled science I laugh at their retardation and misunderstanding.
0.760000	I believe that the process for becoming a doctor is a long and arduous one.  This makes it a profession in which a larger percentage of the individuals in it are truly committed to their practice.  Being a doctor is an extremely important job and I think the majority of doctors in it truly want what is best for the patient.
0.840000	My primary dr has been my dr for 25 years,  I trust her, I think she is great.  he never hesitates to help me
0.600000	I saw the results of his work and I know I can trust him in terms of whats best for my health. Not sure about what he is charging me for it...
0.600000	I trust doctors, if not to know what's best for me all the time, at least to have a much better shot at it than I do. But I don't necessarily trust them to have the same priorities I do. That doesn't even necessarily mean that I don't trust them to put my health as the top priority - sometimes that's not MY top priority. I'm still kind of ticked off at a doctor who ordered $1000 worth of blood tests for PCOS, which it turned out I don't even have and which was nowhere close to his specialty (he was a psychiatrist!). Yes, there was a small chance I had PCOS. Yes, if I had had it, there would have been a small chance of heart problems (all the other symptoms were things I considered either no big deal like hair, or actually beneficial, like amenorrhea and infertility). But good God, $1000! Insurance wouldn't even cover it! I could NOT convince that man that I was poor. So I no longer trust him to make decisions for me, because we don't see eye-to-eye about what's important.
0.720000	I think my doctor is smart and knows what they are doing.
0.680000	Although I don't have a certain doctor that I go to, I trust most doctors in general. Of course, there are bad ones that don't do everything that they are supposed to, or that don't do their job as they are supposed to, but I do trust most doctors in general to do their jobs properly.
0.760000	For the most part, I trust my doctor and her looking out for my best interests. I tend to not fully trust anyone and always think there's a possibility for alterior motives, but for the most part, I trust my doctor's advice.
0.480000	I feel like doctors  have to ear n your trust.  My doctor has not done that as of yet.  Sometimes he speaks to me in a very condescending manner and I just don't like that.  I also feel like he doesn't ask me alot of questions, and just gives me a diagnosis without getting to the meat and potatoes.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because I truly believe she has my best interests at heart. We spent a long time my last visit just taking through all my options and making sure I truly understood what was going on. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is clearly very knowledgeable, and also comes across as confident and direct, which I find reassuring. She is very no-nonsense, which I really appreciate. She is thorough when it comes to tests and exams and I have no reason to believe she has ever misled me with regards to treatment options or anything else.
0.600000	I feel like all they want to do is make the most money they can so they refer things for no reasons like procedures and medicine
0.440000	My experience with doctors has always been that they tend to treat or guess rather than actually putting thought into the process of healthcare. 
1.000000	My Dr is a 38 year old female and she's the best Dr I've ever gone to. She is friendly, caring very easy to talk to, has admitted to me that she didn't go into medicine for the money but wanted to help people. I have complete trust in her.
1.000000	My doctor came with high recommendations. After several visits, he is very thorough, asks questions to get a better understanding, and is open.  He makes sure to ask if I understand, if I have any other questions or concerns.  
0.560000	I like to get a second, third, and sometimes fourth opinion on things. My primary care doctor isn't God and I don't entrust my health to her. Her services are valuable, however.
0.480000	Doctors don't really have enough time to deal with all the solutions that might benefit a patient, so I think the routinize things in a way that I don't trust entirely. For the most part, I do trust their recommendations are genuine and effective, though. 
0.760000	I have had more than one doctor.  The last one I have I get more information, but am not sure about advice.
0.760000	I trust my doctor most of the time. Sometimes I wish she would show a little more compassion but she is a very busy doctor so I overlook it. There are times I wish she would consider different treatments or at least give a referral. All together I do trust her opinion and judgement. 
0.800000	I feel a general trust in doctors because hopefully they are doing their job to help people. 
0.720000	They have years of school and  experence  
0.760000	For the most part I think my doctors have been thorough and did what was best for me.  I think that many times they are over scheduled and are not able to spend enough time with each patient but I think they do what they can.
0.360000	My doctor has never or has rarely asked me nor my family about exercise or diet. I know for a fact that these two things are among the greatest things you can do to prevent, reverse, or cure disease. Our doctor only puts my family on drugs and wants them to have expensive surgery.
0.840000	I can't say that I fully trust my doctors. After all, they are getting paid for what they do. I do believe if it came down to the cost of treatments they would choose they one with the highest cost for me.
0.800000	My doctor has never steered me wrong before. Although he may have been quick with information i have always been able to find out what i need.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she always makes a point to bond with me and explain her reasoning. I've also been going to the same doctor for four years now and they are completely involved in my family. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they are honest. If I didn't trust them I would get a doctor I do trust.  Trust in your doctor is very importan . 
0.800000	I simply trust them because I know that they are a professiol. Usually the person I go to has been in the area for years and is well known by the community. So I assume if they had a history of doing the wrong thing then people would have said something about it. 
0.800000	I don't have much experience interacting with my physician because I'm pretty healthy.
0.960000	My husband and I share the same Doctor and there was a time my husband had an appointment and I did not and I went with him. I had a cold at the time and even though it was not my appointment and I didn't bring it upâ the Doctor noticed and asked me questions. Right then and there he wrote a prescription for me even though I didn't have an appointment for myself. He has always gone above and beyond in the care of my husband as well (who has Type II diabetes) and has always been there for us when we had questions and needs. I would recommend him to anyone.
0.920000	My doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and follow up with appropriate treatments/testing.  This has not always been the case so I can definitely see the difference in what a good doctor and bad doctor are.
0.840000	I believe that for the most part, doctors have their patient's best interests in mind. I think it is somewhat uncommon for doctors to be more concerned about what is best or more convenient for themselves.
0.640000	They are in it for the money, prescribing medications instead of recommending more tural vitamins, minerals, foods for diseases. 
0.680000	I have limited experience with my current primary care doctor but she seems to be pretty thorough and honest.
0.680000	My doctor does not always tell me all options available. Sometimes this is due to his time constraints. In general I trust him and his opinions.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she has been my primary care physician for many years. She has never steered me wrong. I have confidence in her abilities because even though she has been with me for many years, she has been a doctor many years before that. She is very knowledgeable and she is very kind. We know each other well and I trust her completely. I feel very comfortable with her. 
0.840000	i think my doctor is competent. i've been using his service for a long time
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has training and experience. I will question him if I have doubts, and do some of my own research, but I think my doctor is my best resource. 
0.800000	I've had the same doctor for a very long time and she's always put in the time to see me and help me feel better no matter what's wrong.
0.840000	i trust them because they are professiols
0.720000	I trust the information provided by my doctor. She is very thorough and ensures I do not leave with questions. I sometimes wonder if she doesn't provide me with all the information regarding my health if she deems it irrelevant. I do find myself frustrated with waiting as that does make me seem as it's more to accommodate the doctor vs. the patient. 
0.520000	i do not know her very well yet
0.960000	I have a high trust with my primary care physician because I have been going to the same physician for a long time. If there is something I do not understand I can ask for more clarity on the matter. Long term relation with my physician have helped me secure my trust in all the things my physician say, and I can tell that my physician cares deeply about me.
0.680000	I trust her.  I just want to look over anything she prescribes to me
0.640000	My doctor tends to be really straightforward without sugarcoating anything. If I have something wrong with me, then he just says it and tells me how to treat it. 
0.640000	I think it varies from doctor to doctor. I had one doctor whom was vary vague with me. While I liked her and trusted her, she really didn't give me any additiol info when I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. She knew I was a smoker but didn't suggest any lifestyle changes. My second doctor told me that smoking would make it worse and I should have quit a long time ago. So it's really hard to trust doctors when one will say something and another won't mention other important information that you might want to be aware of.
0.840000	I have a lot of trust in my doctor because he is a close family friend, but I sometimes notice that some of the things he says are a little bit for his convenience.
0.760000	My primary care physician has been with me for a long time and understands my health best. He seems to genuinely care about his patients which makes it easy to give my trust. 
1.000000	I trust them because I've known them a while and they listen to me.
0.760000	"i just started seeing my new primary care this year. i have a reasoble amount of trust in her, though i believe most doctors are very traditiol in their methods and i like to know about ""outside the box"" treatments, such as holistic methods. i like to do my own research on the issues i face and often times doctors don't want to hear what ""dr. google"" has to say."
0.800000	I have never had any issues with any of the doctors I have seen.  They have all seemed to empathize with my issues and appeared to care about my well being.
0.520000	My doctor tends to rush my appointments. She is in and out in less than five minutes, and doesn't really seem to read any of the paperwork I fill out or really take much interest in the concerns I bring to the appointment. Last time, for example, I brought in concerns about my back pain, but she seemed more concerned about my borderline high blood pressue and gave my a referral to a cardiologist.   
0.680000	"I definitely trust doctors, but ""completely"" is an awfully strong word. Doctors have hundreds of different patients, so don't always have the time to get to know me and my conditions as well as is necessary. While I trust their medical knowledge generally, I am ultimately in charge of my own health. "
0.640000	I have been with my doctor for a number of years, and he has always been able to take care of my problems. I think I could better answer this question in regards to why I don't trust him. Sometimes, I read and learn about treatment options, but when I discuss them with the doctor, he generally doesn't give them any merit- I am not talking about radical treatment options which have no backing in the scientific community. However, as I think about this now, I realize that he ought to have my full trust, as he is lettered in medicine and has never done wrong by me. I am virtually experimenting when I offer my input for treatment options. I don't have as much certainty as he does- I could say that I am just trying to see if I could find a solution on my own, sort of like a test of my ego.
0.400000	DOCTORS THESE DAYS ARE OFTEN NOT SUFFICIENTLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT. THEY DO NOT LISTEN OR HAVE AN INTEREST IN LISTENING TO PATIENTS. THEY HAVE 15 MINUTES TO SEE YOU. LESS IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. IF YOU TRY TO ASK A QUESTION THEY ARE IMPATIENT AND TELL YOU THEY DO NOT HAVE TIME. THEY HAVE A SUPERIOR AND JUDGEMENTAL ATTITUDE. THEY ARE OFTEN FLAT OUT RUDE. THEY ALSO BILL FOR THINGS THEY HAVE NOT DONE AT PRICES THAT ARE NOT REASOBLE.
0.720000	I have faith in my doctor and trust her very much. Sometimes I feel that she is a little rushed but all in all she is honest with me and talks with me making me feel at ease.
0.640000	Although I do trust her, there are times that she is so busy, that she barely has time for me. I don't ask questions or tell everything either.
0.760000	I believe my doctor has no reason to lie to me unless it happens to do with trying to sell me a pill of some sort. That does not work for me because I can't swallow pills, so the subject usually moves to altertives or something I can do myself, at home,  to help the problem. I think a doctor can tell who is serious in trying to get well and who just wants attention and/or a prescription of a magic pill to get them well. I am willing to do the work to get myself well, so I get along fine with any doctor I see.
0.960000	My doctor is open and listens to all of my questions and answers them in ways I understand
0.520000	I trust them, but there are times when they rush things and I'm left wondering if they were caring about me at all.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she tells me things I don't want to hear. She will also tell me altertive methods to getting better and not just shoving pills down my throat.
0.440000	I have a general mistrust with doctors in general. I always hear of many problems and mistakes that doctors make and it make me suspicious when they tell me something. I have yet to experience this but hearing other people's story makes me feel like you can never be too careful. I like to get different opinions to make sure what he is telling me is correct.
0.520000	In general i trust my physician. It's not because I don't trust her that I don't tell her everything, it's because I worry about her thinking I'm being silly and a waste of time.
0.840000	I trust my physician because she gives me all my options and tells me the pros and cons before we do anything.  She is available when I need her for anything and always makes room for me.
0.840000	I do trust my Doctor, I do not think he has ill intentions, and I believe he wishes to provide me with the best care possible.
0.920000	I trust my physician because when i have any doubt he is always there to help me and understand any difficulty that i am going through. H e tells me things more in a friendly way than in a doctor type of serious situation. I completely put all my trust in him and he has given me alot of reasons to trust him.
0.600000	I don't currently have a primary care physician at the moment, though I have had a few over the years. I've generally had good experiences, but I also take modern medicine on the whole with a grain of salt. The doctors themselves I trust and believe to be good people doing what they feel is in my best interest. But I think the profession on a whole is quicker to treat symptoms than address causes, and put figurative band-aids on things by prescribing pharmaceuticals to address most things. I've persolly solved some of my own medical issues through my own research and by simply applying that knowledge to take better care of myself through nutrition and exercise. I don't think those basic things are offered up and encouraged often enough - but that may be just as much a reflection on our quick-fix society itself who wants a fast and easy way out of a problem rather than putting work in themselves. So in that case doctors are often doing what their customers want.
0.400000	"I am, in fact, in the middle of changing primary care doctors due to a lack of trust and proper ""fit"" persolity wise. She was too authoritarian and didn't listen, brushing off many of my concerns. In general, I find most doctors to be caring, thoughtful individuals, though often very busy. I trust them until they give me a reason for pause, or concern."
0.960000	Me and my wife have the same doctor now for 15 years.She is a wonderful caring and nice person.We trust her with everything.
0.840000	I have had the same PCP for about 5 years and she has never made me feel rushed and always asks thorough questions about the status of my health. When I have had any problems she made sure to order the appropriate testing.
0.640000	I have had the same physician for more than 30 years. Also he is the same physician for all my family members.
0.840000	My doctor takes all the time I need him to take to explain everything I want or need to know in great detail.  He respects the fact that I do not like taking pills, and is willing to work with me on lowering my dosages to the minimum effective dose for my condition.  He explains all my options thoroughly, and does not let me leave the office until he is sure I understand them.  He will also squeeze me in immediately if there is a sudden worsening of my condition.  
0.800000	My doctor has always spent the time with me that I need to help me with any issues I have.   I am comfortable with my doctor and his ability to help me.
0.720000	because he is our family doctor... i know him from a very long time... i know his capacity as a doctor... he is very kind and highly knowledgeable... so i completely trust him...
0.680000	In general I trust doctors and the science that backs their field. That being said they are human, and for any serious diagnosis I would want an independent second opinion.
0.480000	I have actually gone to my doctor self diagnosed, only to have him tell my I was wrong, but later realize I was correct. I've also caught him being dishonest by neglecting to tell about specific treatment options, and even explaining options incorrectly.
0.280000	I have a medical condition that has been ongoing for years. The last time I went to visit the doctor, I asked her about what procedures I should do for that issue. She said to me that she hadn't seen that in my chart, went and checked, and seemed surprised that I had that condition. I have been seeing her the whole time. Then when she gave me instructions about procedures and what I should do next, she also gave me the last set of test results from the past year, and there was some disturbing results that should have been followed up on at the time. Needless to say, we followed up on them then but it could have been catastrophic for me if the results turned negative, which thankfully they didn't.
0.960000	I trust my doctor as he spends all the time I need at every appointment answering questions and explaining all options, side effects and testing results.
0.800000	He seems to know what he is talking about so I trust him.
0.240000	I have lost over 90% of my sense of smell due to a deviated septum I was born with and has gotten continually worse. It has changed how my voice sounds, makes it difficult to breathe through my nose at times, gives me sinus headaches and makes it hard to chew. After get a cat scan I was told by my doctor it was nothing more than allergies and prescribed flowze. Lost all my trust only adding to the multiple reoccurrences of bad doctor stories I've had.
0.800000	Some doctors are not transparent and they just tell you things without giving you the opportunity to ask them questions and address your concerns. The doctor encourages me to ask questions and tries to clarify my concerns.
0.600000	My doctor is generally in a rush.  I only see him once a year for a check up so I guess that's good but then I have a year's worth of questions to ask.  I usually get one in and then he's off to the next patient.  He was effective at treating a friend of mine so I guess I should trust him on that basis but there's just not enough time.  
0.680000	I don't get to go to the best Dr.s My insurance sends me to a clinic. The Haitian men Dr.'s there speak English as a second language. I do not trust them. 
0.520000	While doctors are educated in their field, they are still human and are capable of making mistakes. Some of them are more interested in their wallet than in you. Some of them have varying degrees of experience. Some of them are just better at specific conditions and not so good at others. Doctors are still just people and suffer the faults of people.
1.000000	I have noticed that she's gone above and beyond when she didn't have to so that makes me very comfortable with her. She also actually listens to what I have to say too instead of brushing me off.
0.240000	My primary care is a nurse practioner. I don't feel she has the qualifications to deal with the many serious issues I have. Her office is packed, the time with her is very short and she does not answer my most pressing questions.
0.800000	I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE WITH MY CURRENT DOCTOR, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD RAPPORT. WE SPEAK EASILY, FRANKLY, AND OPENLY. I FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST HIM GIVEN OUR HISTORY AND HIS NON-JUDGMNENTAL ATTITUDE AND FRIENDLY TURE. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO NOT TRUST HIM, AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF HIS REASONS FOR DOING THINGS, HIS EXPLATIONS OF THINGS, AND CONDUCT IN GENERAL. HE NEVER PRETENDS TO KNOW MORE THAN HE DOES, ALWAYS LISTENS, AND I UNDERSTAND OUR INTERACTIONS, MOTIVES, AND COMMUNICATIONS TOTALLY.
0.760000	I trust my primary doctor because he have treated my diseases for a few years without any significant errors. He treated nicely and friendly. He gave me a lot advice and suggestions on my health condition.  
0.560000	I don't distrust my doctor so much, I just know that he is a human being and doesn't have all of the information. My doctor has a family so when he leaves the office he is not doing research on new treatments or new information. I like my doctor I just think that he is a little out of date and doesn't take the time to educated himself on new medical practices or even new nutritiol information.
0.520000	I think Dr offices have become more of an assembly line, long waits and I just think sometimes they are so rushed patients do not get enough time to get all their questions answered and time to gather information about medications and treatment options in depth.
0.640000	My physician is okay, she seems scattered at times and has made mistakes in appointment times or reading records. But nothing that was critical was overlooked. She is convenient, a female, and although an MD believes in altertives.
0.480000	Conveyor belt care, prescribes drugs my insurance won't cover, just does the very least.
0.480000	"I have little faith in the medical system as a whole simply based on what I have persolly experienced as a person with arthritis and chronic pain, and based on what people I know with other chronic conditions have experienced generally.  In the past, my condition has been ""written off"" as being caused by things I know it is not caused by (for example, the last time I went to a rheumatologist, I them I have had joint pain for most of my life, and their response was it is the insomnia I have only just recently been plagued with that is causing it when for 90% of my life I had a very healthy sleep schedule), thus preventing me from getting proper treatment and having to jump through hoops to ""disprove"" what I already know.  I generally feel doctors do not trust my own knowledge on my health, and therefore I am not totally trusting of them or their motivations.  "
0.840000	I trust that my physician wants what is best for me, but I think they are also bound to what their organization they work for want and what insurance companies will allow. The organizations and insurance companies are only interested in making money and do not have my best interests in mind and put pressure on Drs to avoid expensive procedures - that can delay needed treatment.
0.960000	Trust but verify, using the popular vercular: Never buy a pig in a poke!
1.000000	I love my doctor,I recommend everyone to my doctor but it took 4 doctors before I found him,before I found him I hated doctors they did not listen or care what you say my doctor will sit and talk to me for 20 mins he is great and he does not push pills he believes in fixing your self or your diet,he is great.
0.480000	I don't believe my doctor would deliberately lie to me or mislead me but I do think that at times it just isn't convenient for him to answer my questions or explain things thoroughly to me - that doesn't inspire trust.
0.760000	I've never been given a reason not to trust my PCP - Dentists on the other hand: don't trust them!
0.720000	I have learned over the years to trust in doctor's opinions as they have never let me down in a serious way. Sometimes they tend to be hurried and most do not like to do a lot of chit chatting but the advice seems to be very good. They have the experience in these areas so I usually go with whatever they think.
0.760000	The physician I had been seeing for the last several years left the area, and I only recently saw a new doctor. I have usually had female doctors in the past, but my new doctor is male. He is also my husband's doctor, and my husband likes him, so I decided to give him a try. I've only seen him once, but we got along very well. He took his time, asked questions and patiently allowed me to ask any questions I had. I liked him but it may take time for me to trust him as much as I did my former physician.
0.520000	The few doctors I had some don't seem to interested. They just ask for symptoms then just prescribe medicine. They feel like their disinterest. Just write a prescription and your done.
1.000000	I am on a persol level with my doc. She knows who I am and what I have been through in life and will get right down to the nuts and bolts of my health so we can work on things together
0.840000	I feel my doctor has no reason but to tell me the truth.  I feel they want the best for me.
0.640000	what if a doctor is trying to get you on a medication you dont need  i know most doctors help  people some are in it for the money
1.000000	I completely trust my primary care doctor because I have had the same doctor for over 15 years with no negative experiences or instances.
0.800000	I trust him hes a good man. Very funny. Spends a good amount of time with me. And my health benefits.
0.760000	Based on his performance and advice throughout the years. I feel confident in his decisions.
0.800000	My doctor has far more knowledge about medical conditions and treatments than I do. He seems to genuinely be interested in recommending the best solutions for my health needs. For these reasons I have to trust him.
0.640000	because they have more knowledge, education, and training than I do and though I may think I know, they likely know better. They have seen more people with similar issues than I possibly could so I trust them mostly. I also think that they are influenced by things such as insurance and pharma companies and such. That is why I think sometimes they rely on what is convenient and makes them the most money.
0.800000	i trust my physician because she does a great job of going over different options to my problems. she doesn't just say there is only one path of treatment. she looks at the whole picture.
0.840000	I feel that my primary care physician always listens to me so this has helped build up my trust over the years.  I have always felt she has taken the best path for my medical needs.
0.680000	I feel that she wants the best for me however, trying different medications with no foreseeable outcome has been rough. She hears me but doesn't give me the drug in which would benefit me most. She has the best intentions in trying the safest method however it seems to be a bit stunted.
0.760000	I don't know my doctor all that well, but I believe her sincerity, and that she cares about how I am/feel.
0.560000	I feel like a lot of the time the doctor is just more interested in getting out of the room as quickly as possible. Anytime a question is asked, there is a quick, rushed response as if the question was annoying. Sometimes I even ask for addition tests and they are disregarded as not needed even though there have been times when the additiol test would have helped healing faster and was later proven to be so.
0.440000	My doctor sends me for ultrasounds that I don't need. 
1.000000	When I first went to him, I was leaving a Dr that did not take my problems seriously. This Dr. listened, without interruption, to what was happening, asked many questions. He knew exactly what needed to be done to find and fix the problem. He never rushes his patients and always listens to what you're saying.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like she really listens to me. She is thorough and willing to explore different treatments in order to find the best one for me. I never feel like she is rushing me to move on to other patients.
0.840000	I generally trust doctors and believe they have my best interest at heart.
0.840000	I like my PCP a lot. He is patient, thoughtful, and always listens. He is also very willing to utilize care that is more holistic. If I tell him that I'm confused or uncomfortable with a potential medication or treatment, he listens and is willing to explore and consider altertives.
0.800000	I have known my primary doctor for about a year. In this year, I feel I can trust her to want what is best for me. She is very understanding and allows me to question her and even decide (e.g.) not to take a preventative medicine she has suggested. She makes me feel I am listened to and respected.
0.960000	Some would say that medical professiols can't be trusted most of the time because there are times that they will just neglect your opinion and ask you to follow their opinion for their own benefits.Yes, it is true in some instance.However, those behaviors depending on the person you are in contact with.People now in our society has different attitudes and point of view in life and what is important is we must be cautious.
0.760000	My doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. She will take the time to explain my health to me in order for me to understand and go thru many options when treatment arises. She is always patient and listens when I have questions or am worried about my health.
0.560000	He seems nice enough, and he tends to explain things adequately, but I never feel very comfortable with him. I've been in a few times with issues that he's diagnosed was stress or anxiety related muscle tension so I worry that he might think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.
0.840000	my doctor has always shown compassion and caring for me. im never rushed 
0.640000	"I have been with the same primary care doctor for over 10 years now. For me persolly, I have never had a misdiagnosis or a recommendation that required further visits (I don't feel that my doctor is out to cheat people out of their money). However, I do agree that sometimes he might ""wing it"" during my physical checkups. However, I do put trust in him because I know that if there as really something serious, he would let me know. "
0.720000	I do not trust it sometimes. Because, some doctors do not look at the bright side and they are upset the people. And they do not look at the all type of test results. they see just some symptoms in report and they put the me of sickness. but they are not looking other side effect that cause the sickness.
0.640000	"I am a skeptical person in general.  I feel that for the most part I can trust my doctor, but sometimes people forget that doctors are people too.  I work in a hospital and have heard doctors and nurses talking ""off the record.""  These kind of experiences can really change the way a person views healthcare."
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he always makes me feel better.  He gives me exactly what I need to feel better.  He is a nice guy.  I like him.
0.800000	I have had a long doctor/patient relationship with her and she always remembers the different reasons for which I have seen her and follows up. 
0.960000	My doctor is up on medical issues and tries to explain everything in a patient-friendly way.  He always goes over all the options and helps me decide based on my needs and desires instead of ordering me to do something.  He is not tied to any particular treatment and is open to different approaches.  He is experienced and not just out of med school, which makes me feel a little more secure--he has seen a lot over the years which gives him a great perspective on what does and doesn't work.
0.800000	My doctor is pretty good at giving me all of the options and making sure that I am doing what I want, for the most part. There are rare times when they are busy and ther just isn't time and they tell me to just do something and I trust they are doing what is best and know better than myself. 
0.560000	Diagnosing a health issue is not very clear cut. Doctors may give their best guess at what's wrong but may be wrong. Getting an accurate diagnosis can involve a lot of testing, trial and error, or repeat visits. Doctors may take short cuts and prescribe medication based on what is most commonly seen rather than what may be most appropriate in a situation. For example, prescribing antibiotics when presented with generic cold symptoms (which may be caused by a virus).
0.680000	They work very hard throughout their lives to become doctors. I have much faith and trust in them to stick to their oath. 
0.680000	I know my doctor is not out to harm me.  I also understand there are other exterl forces at play (insurance requirements, patient requirements, regulatory requirements, etc.) that can affect treatment.  I believe it is in both my interest and my doctor's interest to be honest with each other and have that level of trust.
0.720000	I trust that my doctor is not going to do anything overtly damaging regarding my care however I do not trust that he is willing to fully treat some medical issues of mine. I have severe anxiety and depression and my doctor is unwilling to treat this issues medically to my satisfaction which causes some quality of life issues for me that greatly reduce my functiolity as a person.
0.600000	I basically trust my physician because she was able to help me with an issue that a previous doctor did not attempt to address.  I also feel that she listens to my problems and takes them seriously.  However, due to previous experiences with doctors, I am uble to trust any of them completely. 
0.840000	I trust her because she listens and discusses with me any health issues or concerns I may have. 
0.720000	I trust my care physician to gather the information he needs to make an informed decision. I trust them to be honest in their assessments and recommendations.  That said I don't always trust that they are giving me every reasoble option and sometimes feel I need to prod for altertives (real Western medicine altertives, not to be confused with altertive-medicine).  Sometimes with prescription recommendations I get concerned over whether I can trust my care physician due shady pharma-reps.
0.440000	I have experienced negative doctor outcomes with members of my family, including my husband, Mother and Father. I therefore question everyhing when it comes to dealing with doctors. 
0.800000	My doctor seems to really want me to understand what problem I have and how to correct/ prevent it.
0.560000	"As recently as TODAY, May 4, 2017, the US Congress is voting on repealing ""Obama-care"". This whole concept of the free market guiding healthcare is absurd. The US is long overdue to adopting tiolized health. I hate to use this worn out saying but, if the US can put men on the Moon, and now spacecraft to Mars and Pluto, then the US can easily have basic healthcare to cover its' citizens. Doctors are hindered by insurance companies and people have ridiculous expectations as to what healthcare should be."
0.520000	He takes time with me, but I think he probably does not try very hard (probably due to dealing with people).  He does not seem to try to find the cause, just treat the symptoms.  I don't distrust him, I just trust my research more.
0.520000	My doctor is a bit snobbish, so I sometimes worry that he thinks so highly of his opinions that he fails to consider other points of view that might actually be valid. He has a lot of pride because of his immense experience and impressive education. But perhaps he has too much pride. 
0.400000	I don't really have a lot of trust in the medical decisions of doctors. There is almost always pressure to diagnose and get the next patient in as quickly as possible. If I had serious concerns that I wasn't sure of I would get a second opinion. Just a few days ago I read about a women who was told her breast cancer was only cysts and the cancer spread throughout her body in the year after her diagnosis, and she wishes she had got a second opinion. The cancer is termil for her and she is only in her early 30's. 
0.320000	I have seen doctors talk about how canbis is dangerous and can make you hallucite, and then proceed to put my mother on opiates as if they were a safer altertive for pain (with full knowledge of the fact that she was also on SSRIs and benzos). Once she was addicted to opiates, they treated her like an addict. When she quit her pills she lost her mind. She is now in rehab for alcohol and illicit drugs. She never drank or did any drugs before her doctors put her on pills. Meth and heroin are schedule 2 drugs, while canbis/ mdma/ psilocybin/ and lsd are classified as schedule 1 (no medical benefit). I guess I distrust the system more than the doctors, but they mostly have to buy in to the system to make it through med school.
0.800000	I haven't experienced a doctor who didn't prioritizes my needs. I know there are doctors that aren't completely honest and are only interested in their pay check, but I don't believe I've ever met one.
1.000000	I have been with him for many years and he has always looked out for me. He was instrumental in diagnosing a serious condition that  when corrected completely changed my life. He also makes sure I understand what he says and follows up. I feel lucky to have him as my doctor.
0.960000	My doctor treats me like a friend, breaks everything down so I can understand her. She is extremely friendly.
0.920000	I trust them because they have always been straightforward with me. There is  no reason to question them so I don't.
0.520000	Sometimes doctors aren't up on the latest research. I've had experiences where doctors let their prejudice against me affect the care I've received. Sometimes doctors don't understand how multiple conditions interact with each other. I think that while most of them are well-meaning and generally competent, they're also busy and stressed and sometimes get stuck in their habits. 
0.800000	All of the doctors I've ever met have been extremely calm and thorough with everything. They always go through procedures and explain exactly what they think and what I should do and why I should do it. I trust them very much and have no reason not to. 
0.760000	After speaking with several primary care physicians, I have concluded that this group generally cares deeply about patients and acts in their best interests. I believe doctors make mistakes or seem cold sometimes because of work pressure and empathy fatigue.
0.840000	My doctor has been helping me and my mother for years and has only recommended things in my best interest. If I hadn't moved away from home I would still use her as my main physician.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she has given my no reason not to trust her.  She explains her thought process when it comes to diagnosing any issues I am having and she explains the pros and cons of various treatment options.  If she makes a recommendation for a certain course of action she explains why.  I guess maybe a primarily trust my doctor because she is transparent.
1.000000	I trust my doctor to give me the medical knowledge I need to mage my life the correct way.  I've never had a doctor who is so willing and able to take the time to listen.  They block out time for each patient.
0.800000	It's simply in their best interest to do their job to the best of their abilities. There's little to gain and a lot to risk if they do otherwise. Of course they're humans so they're not perfect and things happen sometimes.
0.760000	I think most doctors are out to help you. There are some money hungry ones who just want to earn as much as possible and do not care much about you, but all in all, I think most doctors generally care about their patients. 
0.360000	I trust my doctor in a very basic sense. I feel that doctors don't take the time necessary to thoroughly go over medical issues with patients. They are quick to prescribe medications without considering the harm it can do with the side effects. I try to keep up with my own needs and search for medical information to better help me. I feel that I'm the best to look out for myself.
0.560000	my doctor makes me nervous. sometimes i feel belittled. sometimes i understand things but not fully and do not want to seem dumb so don't ask for examples. 
0.800000	My primary care physician has been giving me care for many years. He is a family friend and has always been competent and attentive to my needs as a patient. 
0.640000	Because you asked about my GP, I usually see him when it's about something specific. Generally he listens, performs a few simple, superficial tests and then refers me to a specialist.
0.200000	Doctors do not respect the moral or philosophical views which differ from their own regarding treatment. They treat symptoms and not underlying causes of illness and they do this by pushing medications that cause more harm and side effects to the body, thereby increasing the problems (and the number of medications) that one must battle.
1.000000	I've gone to the same doctor for the past 20 years so I have a decent relationship with him. While I don't go to the doctor often, I know if I do need to that he'll be honest and up front with me. He knows me and is interested in helping me.
0.560000	In the end I feel neutral towards doctors. I know there are some that are good but I have had mixed experiences with them. Whether it be misdiagnosis, bad bedside manner, over charging, etc. So it is hard to feel anything but neutral towards them. But you have to have enough blind faith in them to get the job done because that is what they are educated in. 
0.840000	I have been seeing this doctor for years and I trust his judgement. I have never had any issues or problems with him that would make me doubt his ability or honesty. I am comfortable with him as well.
0.840000	Other members of my family see the same primary care physician as me, and she noticed a serious medical issue affecting my mother before any other doctor.
0.720000	My doctor has been honest with me since I've been with her. 
0.840000	I've only been seeing my doctor for about 6 months, but so far he has helped my take care of my health needs by referring me to specialists and prescribing medication which has helped me. He has also ordered tests to make sure nothing is wrong with me. He talks to me like a person and not just a patient, he understands my needs an listens to what I have to say.
0.800000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care doctor. My first meeting with her was a little awkward because it seemed like she was a little distracted and it took a little time for that feeling to go away. Subsequent appointments have been much more relaxed and she has been pretty easy to talk to. She always gives thorough explations and goes over my lab results with me, paying closer attention to anything that has changed since my last appointment. I feel very comfortable asking her questions. She gives me time to ask questions and give me good answers. She also hasn't hesitated to give me referrals to specialists when that has been needed. Overall I find her to be very helpful and knowledgeable.
1.000000	I trust my doctors because they've always been honest with me.
0.680000	some times i can trust doctors but not all the time some times doctors advice go wrong because if we cant explain our doctprs how he can guide us. many times we never know our situation so how can we trust them in all casses.
0.920000	I have been going to this same doctor for several years; I feel she knows me well. She considers my emotiol status as well as my physical status to determine the best course of treatment for me.
0.560000	I trust somewhat because of professiol training but sometimes I feel like they have so much on their shoulders that they might just write off some of my concerns and think of the first thing that comes on their mind to solve my problem so they can get to the next patient
0.600000	He has actually listened and seem more concerned than most doctors I have had in the past. I trust him, to an extent, because he seems to listen and try to figure out the best action to take, but since I have had testing on things that were expensive and still had no resolution and he seems to not have as much experience as others, I do not completely trust him.
1.000000	I've known my family doctor for a very long time and trust him on a persol level in addition to a professiol one.
0.800000	My doctor says a good businessman can never be a good doctor and a good doctor cannot be a good businessman. My doctor has a simple practice in which he spends considerable time with each patient.
0.600000	I don't have one but the ones I had in the past do not fit the category of fully trusted.  
0.640000	I do trust them, but I want to be informed as it is my body, and I want to agree with everything that is done to it, or put a stop if I am not. 
0.600000	I feel that my PCF is a kind person and has intentions to help yet does not want to realty invest in the thought and process needed to truly uncover my medical issues. Specifically my secondary infertility issues. I have seen her twice and she can't seem to ever move things along in the process and sort it out. I am extremely discouraged by her lack of urgency.  
0.480000	I think there is a mindset is medicine today that you need to get the patient in and out quickly. You have to consider what insurance will pay for when running tests. Doctors rarely get to know you well enough to have a complete understanding of your life and finding out what underlying causes may be contributing to what's wrong with you.
0.760000	My doctor takes time to talk with me and answer all my questions. There is also time to discuss all options thoroughly to gain the clearest picture.
0.560000	ALL DOCTORS WANT IS MONEY
1.000000	My doctor is a candid, relaxed older gentleman who seems to always say exactly what he means. He has never given me the impression that he's in a hurry to see other patients, or that he wants to quickly diagnose me. He's put me through thorough tests, asked me a lot of questions, and suggested many options to me.  The fact that he's so thorough and patient makes me completely trust him to act in my best interests.
0.560000	I don't have a primary doctor but I do feel that most doctors that I have dealt with of very trustworthy. I haven't had any issues of being mislead of being misinformed over any medical situation. Most doctors I have dealt with seem sincere and show concern. 
0.400000	My primary care physician is a very nice, warm, friendly woman, and I liked her immediately upon meeting her. However, during our last appointment, she prescribed a medication that has awful side effects, some side effects that I had expressed concern about with her during that same appointment, so I was disappointed to read about those side effects after picking the medication up from the pharmacy and that made me second guess my immediate trust in this physician. 
0.760000	I have always trusted my doctor.  He has been my persol doctor ever since I had my first heart attack.  I can say I do not trust his nurses due to their ruse behavior, but my doctor yes.  He has done persol visits to my home before and has taken good care of my health after my first heart attack experience.  I feel much better now than before. 
0.800000	I think for the most part doctors are persoble and want to help their patients. Doctors are generally fairly nice to their patients and want to find the best care practice for them.
0.760000	i always follow  our   family doctor because he is updated the lated treatment and medicines etc
0.480000	In regard's to doctor's in general, I have a lack of trust of doctor's for the reason that I have had multiple friend's and loved one's die from cancer. Cancer is a business in this country and patient's with cancer are not told the complete truth when it comes to treating cancer.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he if very thorough and explains things well. He is very caring and takes time out at the beginning of my visit to ask about my life and family. He never rushes his patients and takes a good amount of time with them.
0.560000	I feel that today doctors are just trying not to get sued. So they go with the safest least liable option always and what is convent cause the most patients they see means the most money for them. 
0.440000	My primary care physician does not care to fully diagnose me or most of his patients for that matter. He will do a series of tests or ask questions to get a general idea of what may be wrong, and will then prescribe antibiotics, painkillers, etc. without even confirming I actually need the medicine.
0.480000	All doctors follow rules and procedures that are generalized for everyone and not for me. They may or may not take me 100% at my word when I describe symptoms and feelings and will not provide all options if they don't approve of one. I've only been able to get full information when I pressed and asked, although I have encountered some doctors that did let me make the fil decision without judgement. I feel I know my body best, and often they don't take that same attitude.
0.560000	I've been seeing my doctor for a long time and he hasn't ever really steered me wrong, but I also haven't really ever dealt with any serious health problems. I have family members who have stopped seeing this doctor because they thought he wasn't taking the time necessary to deal with their conditions, but until that happens to me or if I have a condition I don't think he can handle I will continue to see him.
0.800000	I have never had any problems with my primary care physician. He is very experienced, wise , efficient and considerate. 
0.440000	Most doctors are in the pockets of big pharma, and too willing just to prescribe pills insteas of really looking into the problem.
0.880000	I have been seeing him for a few years now. He is very thorough and he explains things to me very well when I have questions.
0.440000	My feeling towards them stem from a simply fact they only want there money. They provide only temporally fix to the issue just so you visit them again.
0.440000	Even though I have been going for at least 4 years, he often mistakes details about my conditions.  Also there is a language barrier communication problem.  He often prescribes medications which I find out later are harmful to take given some of my other conditions.  Unfortutely he is one of the only providers of my insurance carrier within my local area. Some of the problems I try to fix by writing out questions.  All in all, he will correct mistakes when I point them out.
0.840000	I tend to trust my physical because he feels like he is knowledgeable. He also doesn't seem like someone who rushes through patients. He takes the time to answer any questions I might have. He seems to care.
0.800000	My doctor is calm and collected and very sympathetic. She seems to care about me as a patient so I trust her.
0.720000	I would trust my primary car physician because it is a doctor that you regularly see and they know you and your health. they will know if something is wrong.
0.760000	I trust her because she is very professiol and through with everything. I have had her for several years and always glad to see her
0.840000	My PCP is very mellow and always has a calm demeanor when engaging with me. He asks questions, is not judgmental when hearing my responses, and often makes suggestions about types of treatment even when I am always willing to go with whatever he recommends first. He has never rushed me during our meetings and I never felt that he saw me as just another patient or that he only saw his profession as just work; he seems to genuinely care about all his clients.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he will tell me that I'm doing something wrong. For example, my blood sugars were elevated and he told me directly that if I don't cut down my candy consumption, he will not see me as a patient anymore. He really cares for my health and not only that but explains things in real context.
0.800000	With one notable exception, all the doctors that I have dealt with have been professiol, if a bit brusque. For the most part though, I've never gotten any bad advice or diagnosis, so I can't really complain about the bedside manner if they tend to do the job well.
0.800000	I have never been given any reason not to trust my Doctor. He has always been able to provide the level of care that I expect and always answers my questions satisfactorily 
0.600000	Because it would lead towards others not being truthful with their things
0.600000	My doctor is very knowledgeable and thorough but I still feel more comfortable researching and getting second opinions. I don't trust anyone blindly. 
0.600000	There are two levels of trust I have for a person who is providing me a service. The trust of them as a person and the trust in the service they're providing. I trust must doctors as good people, but that doesn't mean they can't make mistakes or not be adequately informed about something. I may rely on a doctor, but that doesn't mean I trust him or her 100%.
0.960000	Well I have known him for a long time and he is a good guy. He has never made a serious mistake in regards to helping me so I have great trust in him. He is also always quite nice. 
0.800000	I have gone to the same primary care physician for the past twenty years.  He has always been patient, upfront, and honest with me.  He has never given me a reason to second guess his intentions or information. 
0.840000	My doctor is very bright and because of this I have learned to trust her more and more.   It is my own persol distrust of people that made me not trust her 100% when I first starting going to her for care.
1.000000	He is a board certified doctor. He has over 40 years experience in the field. 
0.600000	I am kind of in the middle on this. I neither trust or distrust. I believe that my doctor might not be able to devote as much time to my health as is necessary to make the best health decisions possible. 
0.960000	I love my doctor!  I started seeing him several years ago because of some mild but confusing symptoms a GP thought needed special attention from an endocrinologist.  My mom had been seeing this doctor- Dr. Marcus- for some time before, so I had a good recommendation.  Dr. Marcus is very kind, very thorough, and an impression diagnostician.  He was able to guess at possible causes for what seemed like very strange symptoms and had me take various tests to confirm things and rrow down the possibilities.  He always answers all my questions and believes strongly in preventative medicine.
0.760000	I've had some pretty negative experiences with PCPs. Mostly due to the fact I smoke canbis and don't want medication. I and my new PCP find that canbis is much safer than being prescribed benzos and adderall my whole life.I trust her because it doesn't seem like she is pushing pills.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and open.  She tells me why she makes a diagnosis.  She gives me time to ask questions.
0.800000	In general my physician does a thorough job. Never seem to be in a rush or anything.
0.880000	He's always been upfront with me and has given me multiple ways to go about a situation. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor to treat what symptoms I have explained to him but sometimes I do not know how to explain my symptoms and will have to make a couple of trips to the doctor's office to get the correct diagnosis. 
0.840000	My primary doctor is really good with patients and caring.  I think she has her patient's best interest in her heart.  She is careful not to give me too many pills of the same med.  For example she didn't want to give me any more of the pink blood pressure med, so she gave me a different one so I could have more of what I needed but not too much of one kind.  
0.800000	Overall, I trust my physician.  He is professiol, courteous, and always patient in answering my questions.  He is also prompt and ready, when I set an appointment with him.  He is also open-minded and discuss various options and aspects about my health.
0.560000	I have a friend who highly distrusts most doctors due to her extensive experience with them, and I trust her judgements about things. However, I have seen nothing strange from my own doctor. 
0.760000	She has been open about what I have and how to treat them.  She seems to listen me sincerely and in a warm, attentive manner.  It doesn't look like she's going through the motions of pretending to listen and care about me, not brushing me off if I have concerns or questions, and she is accommodating towards me.  She also provides articles that she has her nurse print out for me to take home and study about treatments and conditions.
0.680000	I think that I trust my doctor but always try to relay on my own instincts also. If there is something that I don't agree with or a treatment that I'm not sure about, I always wait and do my own research before jumping on board. 
1.000000	I feel really good when I go to my doctor because I know that I can go in the office with a bunch of questions and I will have them all answered by the time I leave. I do not feel rushed, which is a huge deal for me. I think my doctor is thorough and very interested in my as a patient rather than just a number or someone written in his appointment book.
0.440000	My physician is extremely busy and usually seems preoccupied by something. I live in a rural area and patients are often seen by assistants and students rather than the physician. I am concerned that local practitioners are not up-to-date with current findings. Medicine here seems to consist of ibuprofen, Gatorade and Jesus.
0.800000	My doctor listens to me and thinks about what to do often if he can not figure things out he will send me to a specialist.
0.440000	I know they get kickbacks for prescribing certain medications from companies and so they do in fact go out of their way to prescribe them when the might not be the best medication for the ailment or might even be harmful or just plain not need medication at all.  The can put their bottom line first which is never good for the patient.  This is not always the case of course but it happens way more than it should (of course it should never happen at all)
0.720000	"My primary care physician treats me with respect and understanding. He has great ""bedside manners"". He always listens to my needs, likes, and dislikes. "
0.320000	I don't see the doctor frequently enough for them to know me or my health, so it'd be difficult for them to be particularly insightful. They are usually behind and seem very rushed. They don't really examine me or ask questions. They'll look at the part pertinent to the complaint that prompted the visit and prescribe the treatment I would have guessed I needed before I went in.
0.800000	I went to many doctors before I chose mine. She is very caring and very careful and attentive. I can tell she really cares and has my best interest at heart. 
0.520000	I feel that i am just a number and a pay check most of the time. I have had a few different pain issues over the last 10 years that no medicine, exercise or checkup has been able to diagnose, help, or fix. 
0.760000	I do not know my primary care doctor.  He was assigned to me with the ovomitdon'tcare tax went into effect.  I have yet to be able to get an appointment with him.  Every time I need a doctor, I call and, first, I am told he is not taking any new patients.  When I tell them he is my assigned doctor, I am told the first available appointment is 6 to 8 months away.  Thanks to the ovomitdon'tcare tax, the emergency room is my primary care doctor.  I answered the above questions based on the two times in the past 4 years I have had to go to the emergency room.
0.560000	I have only seen my physician twice.  I do not know him that well. I believe that he is capable, and that he really does want to keep me healthy as can be.  At the same time I think he is also out to make money, which may mean unnecessary tests.  I have to see him more to find out if I really trust him before I am willing to say that I do.
0.680000	I trust my physician because I don't feel like he's trying to oversell me to get more from my insurance. His answers and explations are quite clear. 
0.520000	Some are not very persoble and always feels like they're in a rush.  The ones who have practicing for too long appear to fit this description.  It seems they have loss interest in their profession.  
0.480000	When I've gone to my physician or even one at an emergency care facility they often try to rush you and generalize what is going on. This would be when you explain symptoms and you say you've had a bad cough for three weeks and they just blow you off and tell you there is a cold going around and when you end up in an emergency room you find out you had a bacterial infection in your lungs. Its hard to trust them as it's a business now and they move people in and out like cattle. If you're lucky your Dr will spend 5 minutes with you but the nurses usually do all the interview work.
0.800000	He is a good doctor and has always given me the best care possible. He is always willing to see me on a last minute basis if I need to come in. 
0.960000	My doctor is very truthful to me and she always tells me exactly what I want to hear, which is the truth. She is very qualified and I consider her one of the best doctors in the area.
0.480000	Doctors don't really seem to take their time with the patients, that's usually the nurses job, so they don;t seem to care too much or the cherry-picked the patients they went to care about..and I generally don't just anyone that pushes unnecessary medications and treatment on their patients so they can line their pockets or an money for their hospital. 
0.560000	I've found that physicians rarely agree which makes me nervous.  Often there are treatments or reseasrch on existing treatments that unengaged doctors are not aware of.
0.680000	He's very open and discusses the options with me openly.  He takes the time to answer my questions and provide me with options.  What he's done so far has worked well.
0.800000	I trust them because I don't think they would want to hurt me.
1.000000	I've been with my Doctor now for almost a decade and I've had little or no reason not to trust he has my best interests at heart. He only prescribes drugs when I really need them and gives me more than one option for treatment with full information.
0.720000	Yes I trust my physician. I generally trust most people unless they give me a reason not to.
0.560000	I believe my doctor is competent and concerned. He is  nearing retirement himself and is pretty conventiol in his thinking. Old school is his approach and he doesn't stretch his thinking to consider newer treatment options. I think there is some value in looking at treatments like acupuncture, pain magement techniques beyond meds and holistic treatments. He pooh-poohs such ideas and finds fault with altertive practitioners. So I believe he has my best interest at heart but I think he stopped expanding his views on what options might be.
0.960000	Their overall experience and rating among the community. I have not heard any bad statements about them.
0.720000	I generally trust my primary care physicians. However, I've had recent experiences where the judgment was wrong and it's since made me somewhat skeptical. Two doctors prescribed an antibiotic that wasn't the right choice for treating an infection that almost led to serious consequences. I ended getting advice on a different medicine from family friends that ultimately led to a change in medication. While that experience has made me a little skeptical, I still generally trust doctors and think they have my best interests at heart.
0.320000	The body is meant to heal itself give the proper environment. I don't think taking chemicals and drugs are the way to make that happen. A lot of allopathic doctors don't want to acknowledge tural altertive treatments for their patients because they are being paid by big Pharma to solicit their drugs.
0.400000	I don't have a primary care physician.  I think doctors in general, such as the doctors I've gone to in the past, want to get you out of there as quickly as possible so they want to avoid finding out anything more about a situation or saying anything specific to the individual and not generic.  I generally don't think doctors have taken me seriously.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he has taken an oath to treat his patients as such. No doctor wants the reputaion of bad advice. They take this seriously to become esteemed physicians in the USA.
0.920000	The doctor always takes their time when dealing with me and he doesn't feel likes he is in a hurry. He explains every thing that I need to know and ask me if I have any questions. He makes always has me come back for a check up when I get medicine that I need to see if it is working like it supposed to. I do trust my doctor to act on my interests.
0.840000	i feel that i can trust my doctor because they always give me all the information that i could possibly need regarding treatment plans. they always treat me like a person. and whe also treats the whole person not just the issue and she doesn't just try to push pharmaceuticals on patients.
0.680000	"I don't care how much of an expert any doctor is, you should never trust any one completely. If you want to be healthy then you need to be actively involved, not just relying on someone else for all the answers. So, while I do have great confidence in my doctor, I don't take everything he says as ""the gospel"". I'm not at all above obtaining a second or even third opinion on an issue that I'm still not certain about. At the end of the day, I see it as a 50/50 relationship between doctors and myself...in order to achieve optimal results we both have to do our part."
0.800000	My doctor gives me no reason not to trust them. They always make time for me even when they are busy. The health of their patients is their number one priority. 
0.400000	I do not fully trust my doctor because it's just hard for me to do. I like to do my own research and find tural homeopathic ways of doing things.
0.720000	"I never have total trust in anyone. I do ""mostly"" trust my primary care physician. He's a good man. I like him and he hasn't failed me. But that doesn't mean I don't look online to learn more about the things he tells me to do. I think that's a good thing to do and I don't consider it to be distrusting."
0.480000	the doctor i used to see,seemed to just want to prescribe more pills.even though the previous prescription didnt help.almost like he was guessing.
0.840000	I usually have been healthy so my doctor visits are really short but If there is a problem my doctor is right on top of it and either gets me help or helps me right away by getting me an appointment with the appropriate physician.
0.880000	I trust PCP because I have been a patient of his for over 10 years and I have never got the feeling he has ever been less than truthful with me. 
0.680000	I don't have complete trust in them.  They are so busy and trying so hard to get patients in and out I don't feel they totally are dedicated to providing me with the best care. 
0.680000	I like my doctor. She is very thorough in some areas but a little cavalier in others. I've had to come back twice because she said something wasn't important and it turned out to be more serious.
0.760000	I believe if a person has dedicated their life to healing people, then their suggestions would be valuable. Doctors have a lot invested (time/money) in their careers, I don't believe they would throw that investment away by providing false information to their patients.
0.840000	The doctor always explains the medical problem in detail, and doesn't assume you know what he is talking about.  He thoroughly answers all my questions about the problem or the options.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have known her for a long time and she always have time to see me and my family in case of any emergency. She is always honest and straight forward about my medical issues.
0.680000	I trust my doctor and their diagnosis because I feel that they take the time to listen to my symptoms.  They also take time to evaluate my problem areas and run the necessary test to get a proper diagnosis.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to give me the best treatment options. That the doctor's job after all, to help me feel better. 
0.640000	I have to rely on my primary care physician, because I I don't have any other options to get medical advice. I am distrustful of him on some level, because he is driven by his business interest first very often.
0.720000	I have only seen my new primary care doctor once.  She was thorough in her questions and seemed very involved in my health care with recommendations for action and followup.  (Of interest, I had also seen a dermatologist about the same time... that physician/assistant seemed to actually be grossed out by me and responded with a lot of 'i really dont know what to tell you' and with no recommended treatment, and the clinic calling me with the wrong information only to have to call me back and tell me they made a mistake.)   Truly, I think going to the doctor is a crap shoot as to whether or not you will get someone that cares and doesn't treat you like someone they just need to move through the system.
0.800000	if you cant trust you doctor who can you trust i trust him because he took an oath and is in the service buseiness the buseinss of caring adn heping
0.960000	My doctor is very forthright and honest, they give me the information that I need to know and will give me ideas on what I can honestly do to help make myself healthier or achieve my goals.
0.480000	Most doctors care more about cost than patient care.
1.000000	I have been seeing this doctor for over 12 years and he has always been honest with me. I know my welfare is his top concern and he has always taken very good care of me and health issues that may arise.
0.760000	I do trust my doctor.  I have been seeing the same doctor for about 15 years and I know him very well.  He always has my best interest in mind.
0.800000	Doctors are in a profession to heal people so I would think that in general that they would care about people. And I'd trust them because I think that they want to give the best treatment either due to common human decency or pride in one's profession to do the best work.
1.000000	I have been with my primary care physician for a long period of time.  I have gained a healthy relationship and trust level with her. She has always giving me straight-forward advice and information. Whenever I've asked of side effects or possible outcomes she has always giving me the knowledge and confidence the positive effect greatly out way the negative.
0.600000	I trust doctors I general to a degree, but often I think they are too overbooked to provide the attention most patients need or would like. I think they check symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and a treatment plan, but don't stick around to fully answer patients questions. I feel like a wait around for the doctor and then am rushed once they arrive.
0.280000	I am seeing my doctor for about 2 years.   I have to visit him every 4 weeks.  I distrust him because he doesn't answers the questions important me .  He just follows standard procedures every time.
0.320000	Doctors are always trying to get you to take medications that don't really cure the condition. Their priorities are to the pharmaceutical company and not to the patient. They are not in the business of trying to get people well, just getting patients to take medicines to mage the illness.
0.520000	It seems that doctors can be too detached from their patients. They can sometimes forget patients are people not problems. 
0.960000	My doctor tell me like it is ,he always tell me if im doing good are bad. and will call and see how im doing on the meds and to make sure im taking them the way he wants me to,
0.800000	My doctor has gained my trust within the past year by discovering a serious problem with my thyroid in the process of examining me for rhumatism. I would not have known this if he had not taken the trouble to examine my blood tests carefully and sent me for more specific tests. This process has definitely made me trust his competence and thoroughness.
0.760000	Because she is thorough. I have been going from doctor to doctor before I find this one about medical problems. She was the only one that ordered tests and found my problem, which was a spil cord tumor.
0.760000	If I did not trust my physician I would change and find one that I would.  I trust my physician currently as I watch how he lives his life outside of the medical field.  Church, community, family.  I judge their ethics away from work to get a feel and add it to how Im treated and the discussions at the office.  Its usually going to see other doctors (any little thing you always have to go see somebody else or 2 or 3) where I have my problems with trust, don't have many to choose from so have to use doctors that are available.
0.760000	I have had my primary care doctor for years and it's obvious she's someone who truly cares about her patients and isn't just trying to make money or has been burned out by the job. More than once she has told me I might want to get a second opinion on something, which only increases my trust in her, for I much prefer that rather than a doctor who thinks they're always right.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he tells me what is happening without sugar coating it and I really appreciate that.
0.760000	I feel that physicians are highly qualified, of course more so that me, with the knowledge on medical issues. A PCP knows you and there is trust in that
0.840000	"I trust pcp a lot. She has been my doctor for several years and she has been great. She knows me well and works with me to help me mage my health problems. I'm not ""just another number"" with her. "
0.800000	I believe that doctors in general have their patients needs first in mind, but I also feel like they are over worked and over stressed. They also don't necessarily have all the answers, and have to solve some problems through trail and error.
0.720000	i trust my doctor because she takes time to give me as much information and advice as possible and does not shy away from my questions. Most importantly i find that doing want she advice's me actually helps and improves my health and happiness. She is also very kind and friendly.
0.800000	My primary care doctor has given me no reason to distrust them, so I trust them. The Hippocratic Oath and medical licensing process are enough for me to trust them so long as they don't give me reason not to.
0.480000	I don't put too much trust in my doctor and I always research the pills he prescribes me. The reason for this is that I know a lot of big companies offer money to doctors so they prescribe their pills. I've seen few documentaries about it.
1.000000	I have built up a great relationship with my doctor.  He allows me to contact him anytime and that makes a very persol relationship. 
0.480000	I really have little experience with my primary physician, one incident that stands out is her interpretation of an x-ray when I injured my ankle.  Upon viewing it she decided that there was no fracture, when we looked at it together I thought there looked to be a small fracture - she insisted that what I saw was a vein.  Later that evening I received a call from the radiologist who had reviewed my x-rays and he confirmed that there was a fracture.
0.800000	I trust my doctor.  She never seems to be too busy or distracted to answer my questions.  She is not arrogant some some doctors I have know.  She asks a number of questions about how I am feeling.  She responds very persollybout any medical tests or lab work that I have done.
0.600000	I'd like to trust my doctor more. The issue is that he sees so many patients I often feel like a number. He gets in a rush during appointments. I trust him as far as I can, but I'd prefer to have a doctor that could give me more individualized attention. Sadly that isn't an option for me at this time.
0.760000	I feel I can trust my doctor because he is very professiol. He seems to care about his patients. He also explains things well.
0.600000	Having known a number of doctors, I know that they are human like the rest of us, and make mistakes like the rest of us. I also know that many are over worked and will sometimes rush a patient through his appointment. Others seem to care more for their bank accounts than their patients. And still others are hemmed in by rules and regulations where they work to really provide honest opinion. So no, I don't completely trust any doctor.
0.680000	If you can't trust your Doctor, who can you trust? Even if you have some misgivings, it doesn't hurt to go get a second or even third opinion to allay some of your fears. It's not like Doctor's really have an incentive to lie to their own patients.
0.760000	I think that doctors are people to so they can make errors.  I trust my doctor but still use apps such as WebMD so I can get a sense of what might be the problem before going to the doctor.
0.520000	i just got a new primary physician not too long ago so i dont know him too well. overall i think some doctors, especially psychiatrists (my primary care doctor is a psychiatrist as well) do what is most convenient for themselves.
0.320000	Most of them are paid to push certain drugs on me.  I have a condition that through many doctors, i am uble to ever have two of them agree about it.  I constantly get conflicting info about it.
0.560000	Doctors generally have other considerations besides a patient's optimal treatment. They can be fincially influenced by pharmaceutical organizations and recommend newer and different medications. They can also be driven by profits when recommending procedures that may not be necessary. They also may avoid certain treatments because they do not have the knowledge to recommend them, or they may want to avoid liability. 
0.280000	I currently do not have a primary care physician for the simple fact that I can't find one who is willing to look past their training and realize that not everybody is an identical copy of another. Most of the ones I have encountered are medicine pushers. For those who can't, or would rather not take traditiol forms of western medicine, finding a doctor who believes or takes you seriously is a very difficult task. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because we have a great understanding. We are able to openly communicate and I can also ask any questions that I have. I am comfortable with my doctors. I usually only have doctors I use if I feel comfortable with them.
0.840000	I have been with my doctor 3 years. He spends more than enough time going through things he thinks I should know. He answers my questions and will explain them where I can understand. I am able to email him with questions and he or his nurse will respond within a day. I receive updates on my health and tests. If he feels I need additiol tests done, he or his nurse will email or call me directly and explain why. 
0.800000	I've been lucky enough to have a female doctor who understands my female health related issues.  I trust this person for the most part.  I understand that people are not perfect.  
0.560000	I have never really had an experience where I totally trusted a doctor. I usually go for annual physical exams and it doesn't seem like they really check all the things they should be checking. I think they have a routine to go through and there's very little else above that.  
1.000000	My primary care physician has always had my best interest in mind.  He is always willing to answer my questions or concerns regardless of time.  I feel we have a good relationship and can count on him to provide the best health care. 
0.720000	I do not necessarily distrust my physician I simply don't completely trust anyone. I value my doctors opinions and suggestions greatly but ultimately I make my own decisions. 
0.960000	My doctor is very persoble and doesn't talk down to you when he explains things. I have been lucky enough to not have any serious health issues in a long time, so I don't really have any reason to distrust him. He's never given me anything that I'd call bad advice, and he did give me some useful info about the tension headaches that I get now and then.
0.840000	Honestly, my doctor is from my community and i have this doctor as our family doctor since last 7 years. From the experience my doctor is being honest about our health condition.
1.000000	He is caring and listens to what I have to say and how I feel.  He has had to pass all the testing done to become a Doctor and I don't think many untrustworthy people can pass all the testing that is done.  And he has taken an oath to do no harm all trustworthy people will adhere to any oath they take.
0.480000	Sometimes I trust her judgment other times,I do not. When it come to basic healthcare needs and minor ailments, I trust her. But major issues ,I do not. She is too quick to offer medicines, when I don't think it's a good idea. For example, she encouraged me to take pain medicine after a minor surgery and I refused.
0.600000	overall I think doctors are trust worthy but there are a few sketchy doctors out there and that makes people not want to trust any of them. 
0.880000	He examines me throughly and he runs test if needed.  I see a neurolgist due to a muscle disorder.  I have seen him for the past five years.  He has helped me with every aspect of this disease. Ran every test possible.  Also discussed my diagnosis with other neurologist.   He explains everything so I and my husband completely understand
0.760000	 I think my pcp is honest about the treatments she is aware of, but being a general practitioner she has to rely on specialists for certain conditions. I trust her decision in treatment unless I have found other information that needs to be discussed first.
0.760000	because they always show me how much they care about me.They answer any questions I have and calm me.
0.600000	I don't fully trust my doctor because sometimes I feel he just wants to get me in and out and like he doesn't take much time asking me questions. I have to always tell him I have some questions so he answers them, rather than him asking me if I  have any questions or concerns.
0.560000	I don't trust or distrust them. They are very busy and medicine is complicated so I'm sure they will make many mistakes.
0.560000	Majority doctors are trustworthy but i feel that some can't be bothered much. Just looking for there persol benefits. 
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because i believe him.
0.720000	I have been with them for awhile so I feel confident that they can get the job done right and will provide me with the proper care and diagnosis.
1.000000	My doctor is very good at his job. He's also very honest with me. He works hard to help me stay healthy no matter how much work it is for him. That is why I trust him completely. 
0.640000	I think doctors are doing their best according to their training. Few have any training or knowledge about altertive or tural remedies. I wish they did. 
0.400000	anyone who has spoken to a health professiol knows they don't know everything. more often than not, they have no opinion about some new drug or treatment you are going to ask them about because in fact, you have done more recent research and are probably talking about something that has yet to be in widespread use. they will rely on things that have worked in the past and give the same answers they always give rather than go out of their way. speaking for myself, I don't have a regular routine so I may never see them again and they know it
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he listens to and trust what I have to say about what is going on with me and doesn't try to tell me that I don't know myself and my own body. He talks to me and doesn't talk down to me and I believe he provides me all the information that he has about me and my condition.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to provide me with the best care that is in the scope of his capability.  If I have a problem that is outside the scope of his responsibility I trust him to recommend another competent person.
0.240000	My experiences with doctors in general has been extremely negative.I once broke my ankle and the medical staff wanted to amputate.I refused treatment got a second opinion,had surgery and now walk fine.I had an infection from stepping on a il.The doctor said I would die if I didnt go through a horrific procedure.I refused treatment again and am still alive and healthy.I find most doctors lack the proper skills to diagnose and treat medical problems and have lost faith in the system.If I had trusted the doctors I dealt with in the past I would be in terrible shape.Im glad I was brave enough to stand up to these individuals who are trusted with peoples lives and health and find the proposition of consulting with a doctor as scary and unreliable.
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general because I believe they are trained to treat symptoms and not to get to the root of the problem, which, is often related to lifestyle or environment. I feel that sickness is very politically fraught, and that a doctor who was truly honoring the Hippocratic Oath would be obligated to be politically active and to advocate for improved environmental and economic conditions for the poor. Essentially, I feel that doctors and the medical establishment have a vested interest in maintaining people in a state if illness which requires ongoing treatment, rather than helping people become optimally healthy and teaching them how to improve and maintain their own health. 
0.200000	Having a myriad of experiences with physicians as a result of my background, I can say with absolutely certainty that physicians are predisposed to engaging in bad behavior and ebled by society's misconception of all physicians as a group as being compassiote, competent, ethical, trustworthy etc. Having seen shockingly horrifying and abhorrent displays of bad behavior by physicians, there is no way I have any trust in physicians as a group as they are one of the most self-serving, selfish, manipulative, and uncaring people I have come across. This is not to say that all physicians are like this, however, it is important that people drop their false notion of physicians being equivalent to saints so that patients are better equipped to deal with wily, deceptive physicians and are more motivated to be active when seeking healthcare/engaging with physicians. 
0.760000	i think doctors have a general sense of care about the patient that over exceeds any kind of selfishness they may have 
0.440000	Sometimes I feel like the doctor doesn't believe me when I say I have a problem and she makes excuses as to why I couldn't have this issue because of my age etc. She doesn't even try to find out if there is an underlying issue and just thinks I want drugs which makes it hard for me to get treated for things. 
0.720000	I have always had a good experience with my PCP. She's about my age, which makes me sometimes wish that she had a bit more experience. She always listens to what I have to say although sometimes I feel like she is a bit rushed and just wants to wrap up the appointment. I've never had anything serious come up that she had to treat me for. 
0.760000	Most doctors listen to patient concerns.  
1.000000	My primary doctor has been my doctor for almost 10 years. She is the most caring, loving and thoughtful doctor I have encountered. 
0.720000	I have trust in my physician because they usually provide the right details for me and they thoroughly look into why I feel sick or whatever it may be. I trust their information and they rely to me the appropriate things I need to recover. Reason I put faith in them is because every time I went to them for help, they did their job well. 
0.960000	I feel my doctor (or nurse practitioner) has my best interests in mind because she is always thorough and helpful when we meet with her.  She listens and troubleshoots any issues we have. 
0.240000	"In general, when dealing with a physician, I find that they are blatantly unconcerned with the welfare of their patients up to the point at which they have concerns about legal liability. The vast majority of physician are running assembly line medical practices and are far more concerned about how many patients a day they can move through their office in much the same way that servers in high-volume restaurants are concerned about how many tables they can move during their shift: It is the attempt to /appear/ to care rather than actual concern for the person who is being cared for. That said, I have been fortute enough to have experiences with truly professiol doctors who I often describe as being scientists rather than simply being a part of the medical industry, ""machine,"" so to speak. The pediatrician for my children is a remarkable man who is often willing to spend thirty minutes with each of my children making sure that they have no troubles and beyond that even longer discussing any concerns I have about my children's health. When one of my children needed a fairly minor surgery I was just overwhelmed by the doctor he recommended for it. He was intelligent, concerned, professiol, and not rushed. He was clearly very busy, but he was willing and able to discuss all of my concerns. All things considered, the majority of doctors are not professiols. The professiols are few and far between and rarely encountered in a random selection of doctors."
0.720000	My doctor augmented my lexapro prescription with wellbutrin, and her knowledge to do that was very thorough in my opinion.
0.920000	I have known my physician as a friend before he became my doctor. He was also a work associate before, so I know the type of doctor he is to other people, and I know for a fact he is good and cares about his patinets.
0.600000	While I don't currently have a primary care physician, in the past I have had pretty good doctors. For the most part, I trust them. However, I take some of what they prescribe or suggest with a little grain of salt. Doctors don't take all of the body's systems into account or preventative care when diagnosing or prescribing. They are taught medicine; not nutrition or other tural ways to heal.
0.800000	most doctors that I've had has had the patients best interest in mind. Sometimes they may not seem too warm or attentive but most of the time they are in my experience. They make sure to go over everything thoroughly so they don't miss any symptoms I might be having and that I understand fully the information that they need to tell me.
0.400000	Some doctors don't listen to my needs and concerns.  Many doctors act as if they are impervious to my pain.  Doctors have a tendency not to explain enough about the diagnosis or why they picked the prescription drug they prescribed.
0.800000	She works with me on a care plan whereas most physicians that I've ever seen in the past just assume they know whats best for you and you don't get a say in the matter.
0.600000	I trust him because he's been our family's primary care physician for a long time now. He is very helpful and courteous
0.800000	My doctor is known for having excellent bedside manner. She explains medications thoroughly and answers every question fully.
0.640000	I find that doctors are quick to prescribe medication for symptoms that can be maged otherwise.  I feel it's unnecessary in some cases.  When I have spoken to my doctor about altertive or tural medicine, she is quick to deny it's efficacy, but when I use it, it works.  There have also been times I had to self diagnos because my doctors weren't thoroughly looking into my symptoms.
0.640000	I believe most doctors a trustworthy and are in that profession because they truly want to help patients which equates to them being trustworthy.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he is the family doctor. My parents go to see him and he takes excellent care of them. Just with things ive seen him for, he has earned my trust.
0.640000	I haven't been to my primary care doctor in years. I sometimes feel like doctors over prescribe and over medicalize everything, when there could be more simple solutions. For example, there is proof of doctors over prescribing antibiotics when it isn't necessary.
0.960000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Doctors are very educated about health and they know much more than i do about whats going on inside of me, so if i am told by my doctor that  i need to take certain meds or do a certain thing to fix a problem i am having, i will absolutely do it.
0.720000	According to their knowledge and experience doctors will give you advice that is safer for one's health.
0.560000	In general, I am a skeptical person so probably likely to questions all things, so it seems like I am not completely trusting. Also, I don't feel like the doctor listens carefully to what I am saying, so I am hesitant to put complete in the doctor.  I don't think the doctor will intentiolly lead me in a wrong direction but maybe not the best option for me. 
0.680000	My GP is fairly new at this practice. She is a NP and I think she gets a little hesitant about making decisions on what medication to give you. This in turn makes me nervous. Overall, I trust doctors but I also arm myself with knowledge. I will not take a new medication without researching it. Doctors do not have the time to know everything there is about a medicine they're prescribing. So, a pharmacist and research can be your best friend when it comes to your health.
0.440000	Doctors are rushed, constrained by my insurance (or lack thereof) and are only human so I have a hard time trusting physicians. I usually put my trust in them though because I don't trust myself either. 
0.840000	Well if anyone knows me better than myself it would be my doctor hopefully so I yeah I have trust in my doctor
0.760000	Doctors in general do a great job. I have run into some that haven't and it makes me realize that I need to be careful with the doctor I visit. Most doctors are very considerate and will provide info, but some are more interested in seeing as many patients as possible.
0.880000	I have been seeing her for many years and she has never given me reason not to trust her. She is kind and I really look forward to seeing and speaking with her. I feel that she cares about me persolly, and I am not just a number. 
0.800000	They have always explained why they are going to use a certain kind of treatment and why it's best for me. I've never gotten the impression that they were out for their own gain. I have always been taken care of and wouldn't look to switch any time soon.
0.440000	Sometimes doctors assume I don't do or don't know (fill in blank) or they think of me in terms of a stereotypical type of person who is my age and gender. I like to know just about all the details and even the recent research done on whatever is bothering me, so it's lucky I don't have a condition. I trust myself more than a doctor, in general. They can't know more about me than I do.   
0.600000	I have never had one regular primary care physician as I have moved around a lot. My experiences have varied from one doctor to another. They are all individual human beings with different persolities and flaws.
0.600000	I have a neutral opinion. The only time I questioned the doctor's diagnosis was when I still went to a pediatrician, and they thought I had a bacteria infection. It turned out when the sickness came back, it was actually full blown bronchitis. 
0.760000	I've never really had a reason not to trust my physician. They have always given me what I've needed to feel better and have always been thorough and clear. They make things convenient for me.
0.680000	i trust my doctor knowing that he/she had medical training and education and i don't 
1.000000	I trust my dr because after not going to one in 14 years, I filly found one and she makes me feel safe and respected. 
0.400000	One thing for instance, I just started seeing a new PCP due to insurance changing over,  I have not been impressed by my first visit, hoping it gets better, but like receiving a blood test in the mail stated all was negative and clearly a level of Vitamin D was very low, the test was highlighted in Bold, and labeled Low, but it was stamp signed stating all normal.,  
0.840000	He has given me prescriptions that have alleviated my depression and anxiety issues. He seems to really care because he wants to see me every month and examine how the medications exactly affects me and make changes. When I tell him I have worries about my heart he always checks and listens to my heart for a minute. I have no reason to doubt his honesty.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she explains everything in detail. She always asks if I have any questions or if I understand. She also takes her time with me.
1.000000	My Dr. is very good, caring, and is one of the better ones the local Free Clinic in my community has.  My first confidence in her was also boosted a little when after a first medical appointment I also had needed to get a perscription refilled for anxiety/depression and found that the psychiatric nurse I see at a Human Development Center my community has not only knew her but said that she felt that I was in good hands having been put in the physician's hands then proceeded to tell me a little about her background, experience, etc.  She also had suspected pre-diabetes in me, we did the blood test which proved right and I started following her reccomendations and feel much better.  She is also very humble- I went to thank her after an appointment using the title Dr., and her last me.  She immediately corrected me, thanked me for thinking that and said that she was only a P.A. and would prefer use of her first me.
0.440000	I think most doctors have good intentions but they are very overworked . . .  to the point where it's very difficult for them to do their jobs well.
0.680000	My doctor has a certain style which inspires confidence.  I think this comes mostly from his actions resulting from many years of experience.  There's never a sense that he's following a mechanical flow chart, or reading from a textbook. 
0.320000	I don't trust any doctors.  I have had many problems in the past with many different doctors. They do not know have of what they think they know.
0.840000	I have a relatively young doctor, who is usually very thorough, and very plain-spoken. I respect and appreciate these qualities, and he's never given me reason to doubt him.
0.800000	I feel that although most physicians have a high degree of integrity, I would contend that one is ultimately responsible for one's own well being. That said, not all heath care professiols are beyond scrutiny. I myself have experienced one such doctor who was self serving and egregious in the care of his patients. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician, because she remember all my health history, and she is very good. 
0.720000	I have never been treated wrong by him.
0.600000	It's hard to trust a doctor these days with the amount of money that is involved it's more about money than people I'm afraid.   
0.400000	I do not trust my doctor, because it feels like my doctor doesn't trust me when I'm explaining what is wrong with me. It feels like he rushes our appointment instead of taking the time to hear me out.
0.800000	I trust my physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction. Every time I had a medical condition he has been able to properly diagnosis it and come up with a treatment option. He always offered multiple treatment options that I could take.
0.800000	I totally trust my physician because she spends time and talks to me on various subjects and tells me what are all the pros and cons of various disorders. She is straightforward so I guess I am lucky. Whatever I expect from my doctor I am getting from her, be it anything even if I am hesitant she makes sure I am taken care of and I am in good hands
0.920000	I do not have a primary care physician and avoid seeing doctors when at all possible. However, I do see a clinical psychologist at least weekly, and I trust her completely. She has been working with me for several years now, has been very helpful, and always seems to have her patients' interest first. She goes out of her way to be kind and respect who I am as a person. As for doctors in general, my experiences have been very mixed - some very caring and helpful, others very cold, disrespectful, and arrogant. With that being the case, when I do have to resort to seeing a doctor, I try to keep an open mind, but I also find that I try to gather as much pertinent information as possible before I go to an appointment, communicate the problem clearly (and ONLY the current problem, no extraneous information), and let them know what has worked for me in the past if I've had this issue before. I find it difficult to trust doctors who seem to have their own agenda - for instance, ones who insist on prescribing medications that I know are not really effective for me, or ones who treat every patient as though they're a drug addict (and there are a LOT of these doctors in our area).
0.880000	He is the most well known and highly recommended doctor in my area. He is always extremely thorough and compassiote
0.760000	I trust those medical people that I'm close to. They believe that their approach is correct, and I respect this. However, I sometimes have my own views,.. often, in fact. However, as stated, my trust is generally high.
0.800000	I trust the doctor because has has a long career and has been through many experiences in his practice.  He has not been sued for malpractice and he is still in business. In our relationship, he has not led me wrong and has always given helpful advise.
0.800000	My doctor always takes his time to explain to me what is going on with my health. He is very caring and listens to my concerns.
0.800000	I really trust my doctor because I have been with her for a long time and she has been with us for many health situations. I have a lot of friends who go to her as well, and they have nothing but good thigns to say. I feel like she really listens to us and knows her stuff.
0.400000	I was feeling a lot of pain and other symptoms. I went to my primary doctor and she accused me of exaggerating. She also said that she is not some clinic to get pain pills from because she said I always complain about body pains and it is unlikely someone under 30 can be in so much pain. She still took my blood for sampling and as usual, it showed I had a high white blood cell count. She said I haven't been eating right and she gave me antibiotics. I went for a second opinion and was diagnosed with 2 autoimmune diseases that apparently would have been easy to spot if the other doctor listened closely to everything I kept telling her every time I went in so she could have gotten the proper tests.
0.920000	My doctor actually takes the time to listen and ask questions and not just talk over me or assume 
0.840000	I feel a primary care physician or doctor is trained and highly skilled in their area of expertise. I respect this, although I am cautious and will consult a second opinion if I think it is needed.
0.840000	primary care physician is one of the best things that we can do to ensure better care for ourself. This is because we are likely to become more trusting of our doctor as we see one another over the years, so this can lead to better communication, consistent treatment compliance, and regular appointments. For these reasons, it is important to take the time to find a clinic and primary care physician that we trust.
0.600000	"What I would say is I trust science and how it develops information, which can inform decisions. Through persol experience in seeing how doctors have misdiagnosed my family members and in hearing numerous stories of similar situations from family and friends, I would say doctors often don't care about good outcomes for their patients as much as they should. They can seem uninterested, cold, and have little involvement in the actual ""caring"" part of health care. That being said, I know there are many good doctors who do care, though many may be overworked and somewhat desensitized. "
0.720000	I trust my primary doctor because she attentively listen to what I have to say, and is willing to provide me with the latest treatments and how she arrived at her decision about any treatment that she feels will benefit me. I like that we engage in a dialogue that is therapeutic from both perspective. I feel that my doctor is being honest with me based on her abilities as a doctor
1.000000	My doctor is up-to-date on newest medical treatments and experimental data. She is forthright in talking with me, asks me a lot of questions, and explains everything so I can understand what she is saying. She has a sense of humor. She is thorough in her record keeping, follow-up with me, and treats me as an individual, not a number. She's young, bright, and persoble.
1.000000	I've been going to him since I was fourteen, and he's seen everyone in my family for years. He asks about how we're doing, he makes sure we know exactly what's going on, and he is one of our friends. 
0.800000	The doctors I've dealt with have all been upfront and straightforward with me about whatever condition I've had. They've never deceived me and I've had no reason to distrust them or the advice they've given.
0.720000	i trust my physician because they Treating me with care and concernâ and âTaking your problems seriously.
1.000000	First of all I am generally healthy and go to the doctor twice a year for check ups and blood work evaluations. My doctor is very observant of my physical condition and the medication I take. He is approachable, invites questions, gives you good suggestions for improving your health. I trust my doctor as he has referred me to specialists when he is in doubt. these specialists have always been excellent. I am so fortute to have a great doctor who is also a people person and is not going to treat you for something in a field where he is not an expert.
0.600000	For myself, I go to Planned Parenthood for all my medical needs, so the person who sees me for my medical needs always changes; I never know who I will get. Some practitioners seem quite trusting, while other can't wait to end their day. I think most give good advice, but I always like to double check when it's something very, very important.
0.440000	I usually feel like the doctor is busy and has a lot of things going on at once. Sometimes I get the impression they don't really listen. All in all I say I have to trust their advice but sometimes I feel they can be real impersol.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I feel that he cares about me and wants to help me
0.800000	I've gone to my PCP since I was a child, we have a really good relationship. 
0.480000	I find that my PCP is quite busy, and my time with him is limited.   I also find that the information he (and other PCP(s) I have dealt with) offers is not complete, and that I better understand medical issue(s) by conducting additiol research on my own, and also seeking specialist referral(s) and appropriate testing. 
1.000000	He has helped me in the past in dealing with health issues and he acts more like a friend in our appointments rather than someone just trying to force something and being very indifferent when it comes to our conversations. He actually speaks and you can feel his concern and his understanding. He knows how to be a friend or at least act friendly.
0.440000	I believe his heart is in the right place, but he makes sp judgements regarding care. Sometimes he says one thing then does something else, or doesn't do what he said he would do. Medical science is often wrong regarding treatments and doctors in general are too busy to keep up with the latest changes.
1.000000	My doctors is very qualified and professiol.  I am highly aware that my doctor knows far more than I do.  My doctor has educatiol experience in many areas that I do not. I trust my doctor's knowledge, experience and expertise in all medical situations concerning my health.
0.360000	"I distrust most of the medical community in general because they assume that they know more than their success rate would corroborate. Their procedures and treatments are more of an attack on the body, hence the 'negative side-effects"". They rely almost entirely upon laboratory ""medications"", while scoffing at most tural treatments. They're drug pimps for the pharmaceutical industry. Most pharmaceuticals are the result of back-engineering things found in ture that are free. However, you can't have a trillion dollar industry informing people that they can use tural altertives at a small fraction of the cost (if not freely) and that the altertives don't cause sty side-effects. The medical community is great for dealing with body parts, but they're failing miserably when it comes to actually curing diseases. They focus more on making the patient FEEL better while they still have the underlying condition."
0.560000	I have seen many doctors that seem rushed when doing their jobs.
0.760000	Sometimes I suspect if the doctor is looking for his own benefit rather than the patient's benefit, as it happens a lot. for example, advising for a surgery while it is not necessary or a very little benefit will result out of it.
0.920000	He seems direct about my choices. He has good eye contact and is calm, not holding back information. 
0.760000	He doesn't have a deep understanding of some issues, like mental health, but has some standard medications and advice that he shares. Even though there's some areas he could be better in, he's not one of those stubborn primary care doctors that have it in their heads that they know everything.
0.680000	For the most part I have trust in my doctor's decisions, but I don't have complete trust  in anybody except the Lord. I value the doctor's advice, but I would not follow him blindly and if I feel he is not right on something I would not hesitate to get a second opinion or other counsel. I weigh my own thoughts with what he tells me. 
0.720000	Because we think they are knowledgeable and we believe in them and put our trust in them and expect them to provide us with proper guidece
1.000000	I just my doctor due to the fact that any concerns I have had she would always look into it with all her testing to get to the source of the problems even if it took a second opinion from a specialist she would take it a step up. Also because once my doctor has results the treatment that would be given would actually help with whatever was my concern so that's why I trust because I see good outcomes. 
0.760000	ive know my doctor for years, have had him for maybe 8 years if my life, he has always given me advice and the best of care.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician as she takes the time to listen to all my concerns and gave me the proper advise which so far has been positive. She will tell me the pros and cons of the medication before prescribing it. 
0.600000	this is true most of the time that doctors care more about what is convenient to them so we should not completely trust them but not all doctors are same so my view is neutral.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I find him to be credible, well educated, and trustworthy.  He provides attention and familiarity with the issues that have faced me in the past, and face me currently.  Additiolly, he is well reputed in the medical community and has to my knowledge provided sound treatment and service to me. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he usually thoroughly explains everything to me, and is able to answer any questions that I may have. He also explains pros and cons for treatments and helps me to choose what is best for me.
0.920000	I trust him because he has open communication and when I ask questions I get honest responses as well as way to be even more health and get better
0.520000	I feel like now days, doctors are in a rush to get patients out of the office, and not so interested in what is going on with the patient, only what they think or the easiest way to get the patient to leave.
0.840000	I generally trust my doctor because they have always led me in the right direction and provided me with the best information or options in respect to my situation. I still like to do my own research as to things they say or recommend to me, but I generally trust their initial assessments. I think most doctors do really care about their patients needs instead of what is just convenient for them.
0.520000	I distrust physician because I am completely dependent on them to do the right thing or properly inform my about available or possible options
0.680000	I generally trust them, and believe they would consciously act in my best interest but at the same I acknowledge they may be overworked, see many cases a day, and may overlook details. 
0.600000	The major issues I've experienced with my health are things that are not easily diagnosed and sometimes doctors still don't think it even exists. So I'm brushed off quite a bit and that makes me wary of trusting a doctor.
0.840000	I trust my doctor a lot.  Like me, she is a woman, so I know that she has gone through some of the same things as I have.  She spends a lot of time with me and really explains everything.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because thus far i have not been given a reason not to trust her and her expertise. 
0.680000	I usually ask what I already know so there is nothing much to discuss.
0.800000	I have gone to my primary care physician for a long time and he has always helped me get 'better'.  I have never been prescribed a medicine that has harmed me in any way, nor have I been prescribed a course of treatment that hindered my recovery.  
0.800000	Typically when I see a doctor, they are a medical resident. I actually feel more confident in this situation because I know that if there is any doubt, they will seek more information through their attending. I would say I usually trust the doctors I see, but I do like to keep myself informed by other means as well, just in case.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he shows genuine care for me. He goes above and beyond and he gives me all options to consider when i have to choose
0.640000	I trust my current physician. I just recently had a problem and my new doctor actually did all they could to find the problem. All of my searching and information I had from myself they ordered all those tests and asked all the right stuff that matched up so I trust them now.
0.800000	My PCP has always been nice and caring.  I don't have a reason to not trust him or doubt him.  Everything has always worked out well.
1.000000	My doctor is trustful. My doctor does what is best for his patients.
0.480000	I think they sometimes can make mistakes as any person and it's not good to rely on just one person.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they know better than me, also i would know or feel if the doctor is not being honest with me. I have my wife to help me too or guide me. My primary care physician has been my doctor for years and he has helped me a lot on different things so I have built a trust for him.
0.680000	My regular doctor is great. She is not always available however, and then I question the replacements. 
0.800000	He has never done anything to make me not trust him. I've always received good care from him.
1.000000	each time i go to the doctor, she always explains things clearly. She gives me all the options I have to cure what ails me. If she does not know an answer she is not afraid to say it either. So I know she won't just make something up.
0.440000	I think my doctor cares more about making a profit than my well-being. He will talk about my condition and answer questions, but anything that doesn't involve pharmaceutical drugs, he shuts down as bogus. I don't believe that. I don't feel he is very thorough and I really only go to the doctor if absolutely necessary. 
0.560000	they seem kind of crooked
0.720000	"I do not have ""complete trust"" in any human being as any person can make a mistake. I tend to trust my Physician because based upon experience this person has proven to be trustworthy and knowledgeable. Ultimately my health decisions are mine to make guided by the professional knowledge of a trusted Physician."
0.840000	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy as if they're not, then what is the point of them chosing their profession if they just want to scam people?
0.800000	The reason I trust my doctor it is because I have known him for a long time and is a very professional and caring person. He loves what he does.
0.840000	I really think that he tries to make the best decisions for my care. I generally place a good deal of trust in him. If I didn't trust him, I would look for another physician.
0.800000	My doctor has always been open to questions and replies with swift honest answers.He is highly trained, caring and gives no reason for me to doubt him. he has also been my family doctor since 1998.
0.600000	My visits often feels hurried and like there's not enough time for a thorough consideration of my health issues. She seems completely competent, but I don't think enough time is given for her to really be very thorough.
0.720000	Doctors in general are trustworthy because they have a career to uphold. If they were to mess around with you, they could lose their license, or be subject to a huge lawsuit. It's important that doctors uphold the hippocratic oath, or else they won't be around long. You have to trust that you wouldn't be an unlucky few who are are exposed to a terrible doctor. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes time to listen to my problems and examines me thoroughly. He is also smart and empathetic.
0.920000	I've had no reason to not trust him. He always explains things well to me. He doesn't do unnecessary tests and doesn't seem interest d in overbilling for things, just gets right to the point and gets me out of there. 
0.800000	My doctor has always shown me great care.
0.760000	This person seems to be pretty objective in their decisions. I don't see them as the kind of doctor to recommend a lot of unnecessary tests. They mostly seem to want what is good for me.
0.800000	I think he is competent and knows what he is doing. He will be honest with me and let me know what the situation is. If something is out of his realm then he will refer me to a proper specialist.
0.720000	I trust my Dr. but I also research my options on my own. I believe the Dr. acts in my best interest but still may not know what is best for me. Is is always better to be informed.
0.600000	I cant say whether or not if i trust or distrust my  doctor. In all honesty it depends upon the situation at hand.
0.720000	I'm a person who needs a lot of information and completely capable of understanding complex medical research. If I think they are hedging or not giving me all the options, I'll find another doctor. If they explain and give me detailed information I trust them.
0.840000	I trust physicians because they obviously don't want to make mistakes, since malpractice is so costly. They have an incentive to do the best they  can, although no one is perfect.
0.600000	"I disagree with a lot of what is taught in ""conventional"" medicine and I do not believe doctors are taught everything they should be taught and are left ""ignorant"" in regard to a lot of important information. Most doctors are trained to be ""pill dispensers"" and are not trained to discover the root cause of most illness. I don't blame doctors as much as I blame the ""establishment"" for the way they teach medicine and put so much emphasis on getting as many patients in and out as possible and maximizing profit."
1.000000	I had the same doctor growing up and for a few years into adulthood. When I became a nurse I started noticing that my doctor seemed to just want to get out of the room and didn't really seem to care much. I switched doctors several times before finding the one I am currently a patient of and he is amazing. He truly cares and takes time with each patient to provide the best care possible.
0.640000	Sometimes I feel like doctors are so pressed for time they are just trying to get out of the room. Also, I worry about their relationships to insurance and drug companies that might influence their course of treatment. I don't think they wish to do harm, they are just conflicted.
0.800000	I trust doctors because they're well-trained and well-intentioned. However, like in many professions, skill level varies with experience and with the doctor in general. Also, there are always more and more cutting edge treatments and statistical evidence being released that often changes things significantly. On top of this, the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and doctors does cause some concern. So a patient should always do due diligence when it comes to any serious procedure, condition, or medication. That being said, the doctor is almost always going to improve your situation and make you aware of what your health circumstances are.
0.480000	I don't have complete trust in my doctor. He is smart and he cares, but he's been wrong too many times and I've had to look elsewhere for answers. I've figured out things on my own that he couldn't after several visits.
0.720000	I don't currently have a PCP, but in general I trust doctors a little but not totally. I think that to some degree big pharma makes it hard for them to be totally unbiased in their decisions. So I think that have my interest in mind, but I also like to do my own research to back up what I am told.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to me. She gives me all the options needed for different treatments and health remedies. She asks me before doing things instead of just telling me they are what I need to do
0.560000	The practice is very busy and he is late all the time. He shuffles a lot of things off to nurses. He seems to know his stuff, but he rushes through it often. It can also take a long time to get an appt or a refill.
0.840000	I have complete trust in my family physician.
0.520000	Doctors are human. They have their own interests like everyone else. So there is going to be bias in there decisions.
0.600000	I have no doc at the moment.  In general I trust no one so everything is approached with skepticism
0.800000	They have more knowledge and experience than I do so I do trust what they have to say. They took an oath to protect their patients and I believe that most try to follow trough on that oath. 
0.800000	I have been seeing him for many years he treats my children and spouse as well so we have discuses many things over the years and I am comfortable with him.
0.480000	Dr's are people like everyone else, and people will always do what is best for them. Maybe they are in a bad mood and want to leave maybe they are getting kickbacks for prescribing a certain drug/treatment. My dr has tried to keep me on a medication that there was no real reason for me to be on, when I pressed her on why she wanted me to take it she could really give me a good reason beyond she said so. 
0.880000	I explained this in the other answer. They really answer my questions in detail. I also research my questions and have access to my medical records online. I also get printed information on my conditions and steps to take when I leave the doctor.
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary doctor for over a decade. She is always willing to listen to my concerns, sets aside enough time to answer any questions I have, and is always willing to listen to any input I want to offer & make any needed modifications to any needed treatment accordingly. I trust her primarily because she has demonstrated, over a number of years, that she is trustworthy.
0.440000	Primary care physician might not have enough knowledge to make an informed decision. The doctor might not be up to date with the latest treatments.
0.840000	He is a smart guy. Been around for many years. 
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician because he treats me kindly.
0.800000	My doctor appears to spend the time necessary to understand my conditions/concerns and address them. She is willing to admit when she does not know something and refers me to a specialist that can help. It probably helps that I am friends with one of her nurses (friends before I started seeing the doctor).
0.800000	my doctor has always given me proper information and prescriptions to make me feel better and each time his remedies have worked for me
0.320000	I recently had a doctor inject me with a different medication than what I normally take, without ever informing me of this or obtaining my consent. It was a generic form of the medication, which I understand is apparently legal to do. I however find it extremely and highly unethical. I have switched doctors as of today. 
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for 9 years and he has been nothing but a profession al and friend. He always diagnoses my correctly and prescribes the correct medicine. 
0.560000	They are human just like the rest of us. My doctor has his own best interests at heart when it comes right down to it. I'm sure that he tries his best to help me, but if my needs conflicted with his I'm sure he would take care of himself first. Nothing against him in particular; I just feel that is how everyone would act. 
0.600000	They don't really seem interested in what I had to say about my body and the side effects of the drugs i'm often prescribed. They sound like a shill trying to get me on many different medications
0.360000	Wrote this in the other section but fits here better. They write down possible conditions and never tell me so I have to read it on my medical records to understand why they are asking me something.
0.400000	I don't see a doctor regularly. In fact, I haven't been to the doctor in 8 years. The reason for this is because the doctor seemed overly concerned with herself, made me feel horrible about myself, recommended a method of birth control that caused damage, didn't give adequate information about the medicine and was overall in a bad mood the whole time. After that visit I had a reduction in funds so I was not able to find a better doctor. Without health insurance, that is difficult. So I just never went back.
0.600000	I only get 10-15 minutes with my physician. She's overworked, I don't think doctors have the time to fully explain everything to each patient.
0.600000	My doctor just rushes through things, but i think she always goes with the best choice
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they are very friendly, understanding, caring and helpful. They always make me feel comfortable asking questions and such. They also always keep my best interest in mind, and making sure I am comfortable with everything before proceeding.
1.000000	In regard to doctors in general, I feel that most put people first and are there because they generally care about people. I don't believe any doctor will intentionally mislead a patient, because I don't think any of them want to face the repercussions from doing so. Ultimately, if they don't treat their patients right, they won't be practicing much longer.
0.880000	I trust my primary physician, I've had the same doctor since I was a child and they're always very thorough. We often spend quite a bit of time when an issue arises to ensure we're taking the proper steps to rectify the situation.  
0.840000	I trust that he is doing things for a good reason.  I believe that he takes his practice seriously.
0.960000	These people have gone to years and years of schooling to get into their position. They just want o do what's best for the patient and don't want to risk their job for anything.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician. He has never been wrong about any medical condition I have ever had. He always explains everything that he feels may be complicated to understand. He always answers all of my questions very thoroughly.
0.800000	My doctor has never gave me a reason not to trust her. She is kind and caring and upfront and honest. 
0.680000	"my doctor does not mention/discuss any real ""natural"" ways to help any kind of  medical issue I might have so I do my own research because I cannot trust that the dr. will give me any such information, instead just wanting to prescribe medications when it may possibly not be needed."
0.480000	I don't trust medical professionals because sometimes they may be sponsored by a drug manufacturer, and they just perform medical services to promote their sponsors. Really don't trust doctors.
0.480000	since I'm the only one on this planet that knows me the best, I make sure to research every possible item no matter how trustworthy, skilled or experience the health professional is. people are not perfect and they do make mistakes. 
0.720000	I do trust my doctor but you can never be too careful because at the end of the day with all the good intentions in the world if something goes wrong I'm the one it'll effect, I have to live with it. So I do trust my doctor but at the end of the day I'm responsible for taking care of myself. I think doctors in general are well intentioned and do the best they can in general.
0.800000	He makes me help safe when I talk to him. I trust in this ability to give me anwsers when every I feel hopeless.
0.840000	I just have always liked them and felt right with them. They are always good to me
0.920000	My doctor is through and never makes us feel rushed. We feel like we are the only one there. They watch our medications to warn us of a conflict. They tell us all of the side effects.
0.560000	My doctor is relatively young, but I feel like he has grown over the 5 or so years I've seen him. Professional growth is a good sign that he is at least trying. I don't trust him completely because I live in an area that the best professionals tend to avoid. I assume he is a bit of a reject. Also, how can you trust any doctor when most of them spend all of 6 minutes diagnosing you?
1.000000	I trust my primary car physician because he has been my doctor since I was born. 
0.920000	I have been with my doctor since I was 18 years old. He has never done unneeded testing, is quick to personally call me when I have questions instead of having a nurse do it. I had a medical scare in November, and he actually came to my house when my blood pressure sky rocketed to wait with me while my husband drove home. 
0.680000	If he can help me get better 
0.800000	I have had bad doctors in the past, I like the relationship i have with this doctor now, I totally trust him, not everyone graduates is good at their job but mine is, at least with me
0.560000	It makes me very uncomfortable that doctors can receive 'kickback' payments from drug manufacturers to recommend their products.
0.440000	The doctor will give you a treatment option that they are familiar with and usually that is not all the options that are available. Insurance companies also influence doctors and the type of treatments they cover. Research the subject on your own, in my opinion.
0.400000	I distrust doctors based on experience of them misdiagnosing me and telling me my issues are imagined. If they dont know about a rare disease they tend to often want to dismiss you. 
0.640000	I wouldn't say I trust or distrust doctors in general. I just believe that they can be wrong or inaccurate at times.
0.760000	"I trust him because he seems genuine in what he says and seems like he truly cares about my wellbeing. However, I can't say that I trust him ""completely"" because I have a bit of distrust in medical professionals and the healthcare industry in general."
0.560000	I feel that doctors sometimes have motivation to pursue a certain treatment plan without narrowly tailoring it to my needs.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because she's been there for me for the last decade. I've gone to her whenever I had issues, major or minor. I've built a relationship with her. That always helps. If I go to a new doctor, I don't think I will have that same feeling.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because my whole family has been going to her for years. I've known her since I was a little kid and now i'm 35. She knows everything about me and she knows how to talk to me.
0.720000	I usually trust my physician because they have no reason to lie to me.  They go based off of current medical information.  Sometimes I get frustrated when I know I need an antibiotic to help me but they refuse or dance around the issue.
0.800000	I have been going to the same doctor since I was born and now my children go to the same one. She has always explained things clearly and given options and tried to do her best for us. 
0.760000	I trust him because he doesn't try to upsell me on anything and takes a very relaxed and practical approach to things.  For example, I need to lose about 30 pounds, instead of being hysterical, he suggested I aim for 1 pound a month.
1.000000	My doctor takes her time with me and I never feel rushed. She will ask about me and give me a chance to ask questions. She engages in real life examples and will put things in plain terms.
0.760000	I do not trust them because they will just prescribe you with over the counter drugs that will end up killing the human body one day.
0.720000	I feel like I have trust in my primary care physician. I feel like they have my best interests in mind and they try to solve any problem that I come to them for. They are really good at what they do.
0.560000	I feel that my medical care providers are very well educated and i can tell, I think they have every motivation to to open and fair and honest with me because they have years of experience and they would not be in the position if they were not adequately helping patients
0.600000	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. But sometimes doctors make choices based on insurance issues, drug company promotion, and other things that are not always good for my general well being.
0.560000	Doctors now a days seem pre-occupied and kind just go through the motions of their job.   I am not sure my best interest is their main concern
0.280000	Most of the time, when I go visit my doctor, she is so busy that she spends a maximum of five minutes with me, looking at her clipboard, asking generic questions and then rushes out. I feel like I am not allowed to ask her questions in the off chance that I am inconveniencing her and her busy day. Makes me not really trust doctors and someimtes i feel like I am prescribed something for the sake of pharma companies tryign to seel patients drugs when we actually don't need them. I honestly dont like to be highly medicated but at times, it looks like docs are looking out for their own salaries and compensations at times. like this. 
1.000000	I've been with my doctor a long time and he never sugarcoats anything he tells me. He is always honest about whatever aspect of my life is going to kill me. He's good.
0.760000	I trust him, but the things I'll take a neutral position on are things like pharmaceutical drugs. I don't like taking them and I'll always do my own research to see if there are other things I can do before trying them. If there isn't, I'll grudgingly take them.
0.800000	I don't have any complex medical conditions so anything the doctor tells me I have no real reason to doubt. I don't see any ill effects from whatever I have been told by my primary doctor.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because it is their job and they are supposed to be knowledgeable on the subject. They have tons of training and education and should be prepared. 
0.720000	I have established a relationship with my doctor over a few years, and find his advice to be pretty trustworthy for the most part. If I ask about other options, he is glad to take the time to talk to me. 
1.000000	My doctor is always very open with their thoughts on any condition I come to them about.  They always give me a chance to ask questions and always make sure that I have a chance to say everything I feel is important.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I believe he has my best interests in mind. I don't feel like I'm being taken advantage of or being talked down to. I think that everything is done with the patient's best interests in mind.
0.800000	My doctor has little reason to lie to me, so I can trust in them to provide me with the proper care. I do question medications when I can, as I know that doctors receive kickbacks and things like that from companies. I try to make sure to use holistic methods when I can. Medications can be dangerous and harmful if you become addicted to them. I prefer to use natural methods when I can, so that I can avoid anything unnecessary.
0.560000	I think my doctor is quick with my visits and so I've started to limit my engagement with him. He's often brushed off concerns in the past as well.
0.360000	The few times I have seen her, she seems to hyper-focus on ONE issue, and almost overdoes it. She tries to quickly get me out of her office after dealing with that ONE issue only, even if I ave 2 or 3 medical issues that need to be dealt with. To get the appropriate care, I would need to go to separate visits for all my individual issues and needs.
0.800000	I have noticed when I am more open and honest with them then in turn it allows them to understand my situation better and they will be more honest and willing to help me because I am not trying to hide anything as well as the relationship I develop with them I can sense they want to help me. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor to be completely honest with me. They took an oath in medical school to help people and be truthful.  
1.000000	I've never been given a reason to distrust him and I haven't been steered wrong yet so until that happens hes good in my book
0.640000	Waiting around for an hour and more in order to talk with a guy for a few minutes annoys me.  I know they're busy, but I hate feeling rushed.  I feel like just another patient file/number.
0.800000	I trust them because they have a lot more knowledge about medical issues than I do. I think most if not all got into the profession to help people, and I dont think they would risk their reputations to harm me. 
0.640000	the truth I do not distrust any doctor if they are in the position they are because something they did well I do not think they have failed
0.800000	I have developed a strong relationship with my primary care doctor. I have seen him for many years now and he has been successful at helping me through various illnesses with success. 
0.240000	I've had so many doctors that simply do not care about their patients, do not explain risks in procedures or medications. The latest doctor I had gave me extremely powerful drugs without explaining their side effects and effectively crippled me (ruined the tendons in my legs).
0.600000	I am pretty neutral in general to how a doctor acts or any motivations I am not seeing. Mostly, I just go when I need to. Get seen and checked on. Told what they think is wrong and then get the medication. If it works great. If it does not then back I go to see what could be the issue. 
0.560000	I think it would be foolish to completely trust a primary care physician. They are humans and make mistakes like the rest of us. If it's something important I will want a second opinion.
0.800000	My primary care physician has always behaved very professionally with me. He is open to answering my questions and will explain things to me when necessary. I know he has had years of schooling and he is very knowledgeable.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor because she does a thorough check with me when I see her for daily check ups. She is always very patient and kind despite how mean some patients can be. She also suggests where I can run tests that won't cost me money. There's never been an incident where I lost my trust in her.
0.800000	I trust my doctor.  He has never lied to me, or seemed to push me in any direction.  He gives me the information that i need, and his opinion, and leaves the decisions up to me.
1.000000	I think that he holds himself to high standards and has always showed me respect and understands me and is compassionate. He has never gave me any reason for me to not trust him. He is always honest and straight forward with me, and that is how I prefer it.
0.480000	I generally trust them to do what is right and make me feel better in the end, although sometimes they only give me one option for moving forward, when I often feel like there are probably many options I have, but they just aren't telling me about it.  I think they only tell me the one that they think is right or best.
0.760000	Because he can attend all the patient it would be very good and nice of it.Great so we can trust physician and it will be very good
0.720000	I have to trust that my doctor is going to say and do what is in my best interests. I want to know exactly what can be and needs to be done in order to get or stay healthy. I want to be confident that my doctor is going to do the things that they have sworn to do as a medical professional, and thinking that they may not be doing so is too upsetting to even consider. 
0.720000	The most obvious things that have changed the perception of medicine over these last forty years include high profile cases of physician fraud, drug abuse, drug pushing, malfeasance, gross malpractice, even murder.   What in the past was often hushed up, or discounted as highly unusual, have now become grist for the media mill.  To say that physiciansâ images have been tarnished by these instances would be an understatement.
0.760000	being inj good health just doesn't need a lot of advice from a dr. treatments are a few pills a day and i feel fine
0.720000	I trust my doctors in general. I don't think there is any reason for a doctor to lie to me or try and deceive me. They may not always be the most attentive or take the most time to get to know what's wrong, but I don't think they're ever intentionally deceitful or anything like that.
0.520000	I think doctors at times will push what is easiest for them or what they think might be a option that is a little more costly when the risk is not too high. I feel like anything else doctors are out to make money. They may ask you to do unneccesary tests as well at times.
0.760000	Although I have only been seeing my current doctor for 6 months, she caught a health issue that made a difference in my life. I trust her to be thorough and give me the care i need. I feel that I need to be with her longer to fully form my opinion, but so far I trust her and believe she is honest. 
0.600000	They're not bad. They haven't given me a reason to distrust them and have been okay so far as far as I can tell.
0.760000	I have a new doctor. I am still learning about him. He is older and I trust him but I also pay attention. 
1.000000	I feel that my doctor has my trust because she is always willing to provide me with information as well as make sure I understand everything before I leave, she takes the time to show compassion for me.
0.720000	My doctor is open with me and generally is able to answer all of my questions.  Though I feel like the doctor is always in a rush and doesn't explain things as fully as possible.
0.600000	I trust him to an extent, but not fully.  I believe he presents the options that are available to me honestly, but I would not trust him to make medical decisions on my behalf - in an important situation or when facing a problem I would want a second opinion, would want to do some research myself, would want to talk to other people about the situation, etc.  I also think my doctor, like many, is often more rushed for time and more concerned with getting to the next patient than I would like him to be.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has done nothing to lose that trust. He always explains why he recommends things
0.440000	i've had a variety of different primary care physicians and this varies for all of them - but sometimes i do get the sense that they're not being very thorough or diligent and just wanting to see the next patient
0.480000	I do not have a stable primary care physician at this time.  With doctors in the past it generally seems as if they are just handling another number in line and waiting to get through to the next person and the person after that.  They generally don't seem to listen very well.  
0.760000	I trust my doctor because She is someone I have known for a long time and also knows my family.  This person has always had my best intentions and has always helped me to feel better when I was feeling ill.
0.440000	"She is very busy and quick and gives recommendations rather than talking to me and asking if I want a certain test or procedure. In general I prefer a less ""medical"" approach to health care than she does."
0.600000	I currently don't have a primary care doctor so it's hard for me to answer this question. When I do have a problem I will go to an expres clinic and I've had good and bad experiences. More good than bad. I try to put my trust in doctors but sometimes they are worried about getting people in and out of the room like cattle. 
0.600000	It can be hard to trust physician due to financial incentives they may or may not have. I often wonder if physicians have to do so many procedures, write so many prescriptions, etc. just to stay a float. 
0.720000	I trust my physician. She asks a lot of questions and always wants to know what works and what doesn't work for me. She offers medication and solutions.
0.840000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years now and we get along very well; both of us almost look forward to seeing one another. Also, her being a woman like myself helps with our rapport and my general comfort around her.
0.680000	Well I'm more so neutral because I have new physician due to living in a college town while attending.  I've only had to go to her so far for a health check up for insurance purposes.  I had nothing wrong with me so there wasn't any real medical needs present at that time.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I have never been led astray before by him. Every time that I went to my primary care physician, it has been a pleasant experience. I have gotten good medication and health advise. 
0.560000	I trust doctors for the most part because they have dedicated their lives to helping others. Because of this, I assume that they have my best interests in mind, especially when it comes to my personal health. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have always gotten a working solution for my problems. She asks many detailed questions to make sure she can understand what I am trying to describe and is able to come up with a valid diagnosis. She also provides me with all the information I need to know about my different diagnosis.
0.480000	I have a rare condition and itâs obvious my pcp does not know a whole lot about it. Also I feel like doctors are rushed and donât take the time to do the best care
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he seems to know what he is doing and is always super friendly. It helps that we are friends outside of work too. I feel like I could go to him about anything and he will do what is best for me no matter what it takes.
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician as she seems dedicated to providing good care and she is well educated. She does however rush through patient visits and many times downplays my concerns or refers me to other people for the answers I need such as nurses or the pharmacy.    
0.680000	My old doctor I trust because he would be very open and straightforward with me and he would always make sure I am feeling ok. I am not sure about other doctors but hope they would be as good as him. 
1.000000	I love my Doctor and have been seeing him for over 5 years. He is brutally honest with me about everything and is very blunt, which I love. I like to know everything about any diagnosis and he always tells me both the good and bad possibilities. It makes me feel confident in him because he isn't hiding anything.
0.800000	I have known my primary care physician for a long long time now, and every time I get sick or I need help with a medical condition he is there for me, always knows what is going on and always helps me
0.720000	I have been seeing the same family care physician since I was born so I have come to trust him. However, I do feel that every doctor has their own way of thinking that might be different from my way of thinking. 
0.800000	My doctor helped cure the problems I had with my neck and shoulder for over a year and listened to everything I said and was very helpful in getting everything done. It was better than seeing other doctors I had seen before.
0.800000	In general, I trust doctors to be highly skilled and highly knowledgeable in their practice. I do believe they genuinely care about helping others and want to look out for the best interests of their patients.
0.840000	I feel that you can trust a doctor fairly well because the last thing they want is to cause you harm. For one they most likely would feel bad and morally wrong for hurting a patient. Also they do not want any law suits on their record or in their life at all.
0.800000	I have never had a major medical issue come up for me.  It's always something minor like a cold, sore throat, or something along those lines.  When I have taken my daughter to the doctor it is always for something minor as well.  Our doctors have always given great advice and the right prescriptions for our needs.  I have no reason not to trust them, but I know I  might feel different if I went to the doctor more often.
0.840000	I don't have a primary care physician, but I trust doctors in general. I believe that they are extremely knowledgable in their field, and took on the job because they have the desire to help people. Therefore, I would say that I am very trusting of their advice.
0.600000	I would have to say more than anything I feel a doctor is there to rush me in and out. I don't go very often but I never feel like I'm truly heard. I wait for 30-45 minutes for 5 minutes with them saying exactly what I have already told them and them prescribing something. I feel like I should be able to see a doctor nearly instantly for a cold, flu, or something common so I can be in and out and not waste my time.
0.880000	I generally trust doctors in telling me what's wrong with me based on my symptoms.  My trust wavers however when it comes to being prescribed medications.  I feel sometimes doctors prescribe stuff that isn't needed in order to make money off that prescription.
0.600000	My trust is mixed. I've had great experiences with my doctor where they were very caring and compassionate and helpful. There have been other times when it didn't seem likes they cared about me at all. One time they abandoned me in a room so they wouldn't miss their tee time.
0.520000	I mostly trust the physician. But some physicians are work for the salary period. This may be lead to patient's uncomfortable. Physicians has the high responsible for their patient. But some Physicians are not take care about the patient. Their only focus is to improve their financial stability.
0.600000	I would like my doctor to give me more attention when it comes to my concerns about my health. I would like him to explain things to me better so I can get a better understanding of my health,
0.360000	Most doctors, including my PCP, make judgments about me based on how I look, not about my self or health in general. I frequently feel like my concerns are dismissed by doctors, or they treat me as if I am uneducated.
0.560000	My doctor can come across as very demeaning and curt.  I think this may be because the only appt times I can make are late in the day and he is tired.  Probably more interested in ending the work day and getting home than dealing with my issues.
0.680000	It seems to be really easy to trust a physician.  I believe this way mainly because a person who has obtained that level of job and status has dedicated their entire life to getting to that point, and why would they want to be untrustworthy and not provide the best care possible if it were to put their job at risk that they have literally dedicated their entire life too.  However, many physicians may abuse their power or even be untrustworthy because they want to take advantage of you and make as much money as possible. 
0.800000	i would trust most doctors. i only go to the gynecologist and optometrist, but they are both great. the only time i wouldnt listen to them is in regards to nutrition. 
0.560000	I was on a medication for 7 years that I really did not need. I did some of my own research and asked my doctor about it, and she took me off of it. Ever since, I have had trouble trusting her. 
1.000000	I trust her because she has been my doctor for a couple of years now, and has had enough talks with me and has given me enough tests to where I have developed that trust over the years.
0.520000	I haven't been going to them for long so the trust isn't completely there yet. I imagine with more time and continued good treatment I will trust them a lot more.
0.960000	My primary care physician guided me through the hardest point in my life health wise when I had to be hospitalized for a colon condition. His advice was spot on through the entire ordeal and it was possible to make a fast recovery due to him. His guidance is what makes me trust him really no matter what.
0.200000	I do not trust m primary care physician, nor do I trust doctors in general. I feel like no doctors really care about their patients, instead they only care about making money in this terrible for profit health care system we have here in the United States. 
0.720000	I have had the same PCP for many years and we have an honest relationship.  I trust him to a certain extent only because he knows me and for the most part my habits and can best prescribe something for me if needed.
0.800000	Doctors go through a lot of training and education to enter their careers, and there's a 100% chance that a doctor who is anywhere close to decent has more knowledge about health than I do.
0.800000	i have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor and he has given me no reason whatsoever to mistrust him. He has taken the time to address any and all concerns that I have had.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. He has always been candid with me and I have always been able to rely on his medical opinion. He is intelligent and has never failed me in the past.
0.880000	I've had the same doctor for the last three years. He seems pretty thorough and accomplishes everything that needs to be done during my visits. He's brought up tests I could do if I wanted to but doesn't push them on me.
0.720000	I don't think doctors get to where they are by being selfish and always looking out for themselves. Also, I believe people have an inherent good in them. So even if a doctor is having a bad day or something to that extent, I still think they will do their best to be helpful, answer questions, and get their patients back to normal health or to where they want to be health wise.
0.640000	I think it depends on the type of doctor, but on the whole, I trust doctors to prescribe medications and diagnose, but I also trust my own feelings about my body and what I need. So I usually pit the two against each other. 
0.680000	I generally trust them becuase of all the schooling they had plus i can easily verify if they are lying by doing a quick search online in about 5 minutes
0.800000	I do trust my doctor because she is extremely honest with me and patient with me. She is still new to me since I have had her for 6 months but I already trust her 
0.520000	I often feel rushed and that my treatment is according to protocol, not individual needs.  I often have to remind my doctor about other medication, side effects, etc.
0.600000	the doctor i have no is really not a big help. it seems like he is only in it for the number of patients he can handle in a day. he often has senior citizens so its hard for to relate to the mid age group. he has gotten so much botox that his face is tight looking like something off of tv i call him a rockstar. i feel like he doesnt really care and this is one of the reasons why i am going to be finding me a new doctor this year so i hope it will be soon
0.720000	I've had a couple I have trusted and a couple I have not. My last physician in Hawaii I trusted a lot. I went in with severe pain in my intestines. The nurse wanted me to immediately go to the hospital for a colonoscopy. The doctor asked me some questions, looked at my medical history, and came to the conclusion that I had a non serious condition that could be treated with antibiotics. He gave me the choice of accepting his recommendation or going to the hospital. He explained the pros and cons of each. He gave me reasons for his recommendation and I went with it. He was correct in the end.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because I have a long history with him. He asks appropriate questions to see how I am doing or feeling. I answer his questions honestly & never withhold any information that could affect my care or diagnosis.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I really think he acts in my best interests.  He is trained and more knowledgeable than I am in these areas and so I put my trust in him. 
0.560000	I trust my doctor, because I expect that he has my best health interest at heart. Sometimes, this may not be true which makes it difficult for patients when someone they expect to help them is rather callous to their call for aid. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor or doctor's in general because otherwise why would I even go to them in the first place and if I am unsure of my doctor's ethic ability I would question everything about them.  That just doesn't sound like a good idea for my own health and I would be way more stressed out.  I trust my doctor because to me it's the best option.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to what is the right thing to do for me. He has treated me for so long and never done anything to misuse his trust. I feel confident he will make the best decisions for me and my long term health care. 
0.840000	I think my doctor takes enough time to address my physical and mental health concerns. She takes the time to explain things to me and helps me to explore options if we do not have a solid answer for anything I am dealing with.
0.560000	My current physician has taken me very seriously and been open about all the options, however, past physicians have not at all
0.840000	My doctor always explains things thoroughly and answers all of my questions. He explains the side effects of medications before prescribing them to me, and allows me to decide on what I believe would be the best treatment for myself
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he is always upfront and honest. He takes the time to actually listen to my concerns and takes into consideration my opinions about my health. He works with me to get the kind of medicines that I also will approve of taking instead of giving me medicines that I believe are more dangerous for me to take. He seems very trustworthy and honest. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor's ideas and decisions, but I also allow for the possibility of human error or the fact that she might not know everything about what I'm feeling to give the exact solution I need. Whether that be because I left out something important or because she or I forgot to ask certain questions. My doctor is great, experienced, and well meaning so I don't doubt her but I don't take her word as a complete final decision either.
0.560000	sometimes things go well and other times things dont go well it just happens to be that this is how things have been lately
0.800000	My doctor is always willing to listen to my concerns even when there are many patients out in the waiting, even though I try not to waste his time.
0.800000	I really trust my doctor because I have been with him for over 15 years and nothing he has stated so far has been false. He has the best in mind for me and will be honest when I am not doing something correctly.
0.640000	i don't really go to the doctor that often as i am very healthy generally.  I don't feel any mistrust in my doctor but have little interaction at this time.  I would go if I needed help.
0.600000	as we know little about the health concerns we have no other choice than believing doctor as we can't take risk with our life
0.760000	I believe doctors in general do have the patients' interest at hurt and thus is why I trust my primary care physician.
0.800000	I hardly ever see my physician, but during the times I have seen him, I feel like he listens to what I'm saying and has offered good suggestions.
0.840000	My physician takes the time to listen and does not rush me when I visit. They ask many questions and answer any I may have
0.520000	I don't fully trust my doctors because they're fallible and because I don't know their jobs and therefore can't know if they're truly correct or not.  But that doesn't bother me tremendously because I feel like I'm the ultimate decider on medical decisions and I'm a full participant in getting medical care.  I use the doctor as a resource, but not the final authority.  They answer to me, so I scrutinize their decisions and judgments while still recognizing their knowledge and experience.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician fully because he or she needs to build a relationship with one an other to gain the trust and to feel safe.It is important to trust them because they are smart about the information and always work in your best interest for you.
0.440000	To an extent I trust my physician but it seems as if she is always rushed and just trying to get people in and out as quick as possible. Somethings that seem worrisome to me are just dismissed and not thoroughly explained.
1.000000	My primary care doctor has been working many, many decades. He's very straight forward. My husbands sister also use to work for him, and she's called him an asshole but completely trusts him and his judgement. I feel the same way.
0.680000	I think that in general doctors have little incentive to be dishonest to patients. However, it is easy for people to have biases that influence them and effect trustworthiness, even if they meant to be honest.
0.800000	Even doctors nowadays doubt the efficiency of healthcare system advising patients not to trust physicians âany more than you trust your stockbroker (if you are ... Maybe this is the reason why many doctors are complaining on their patient's behavior accusing them of being âdifficult, nasty, obnoxious .
0.600000	My physician does not hesitate to tell me if there is something I should or should not be doing in regards to my health. She is frank and open with me, and displays concern when evaluating the issues I have. She often seems rushed, however, so I occasionally have doubts about how thorough she it.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because they have extensive training in their profession and the government makes sure they know their stuff.
0.720000	I donât have a close relationship with them, so I donât know them personally cannot trust them completely. What if theyâre told to prescribe a certain drug? I never know if thatâs occuring. 
0.640000	I want to trust my doctor but perhaps it's TV or just my lack of health care growing up. I have an issue with trust. I mean it seems sometime they herd you like cattle. They see you for 2 minutes then it's time to pay and leave. They offer no personal connection. I feel like maybe doctors out in the country where things go at a slower pace and people care about each other more I could trust my doctor but here in the city I don't 
0.480000	Seems like he is into giving out pills like he is influenced by drug sales. So could be conflict of interest there.
0.800000	My doctor is well-trained and has plenty of knowledge and experience. I have never felt like I was being rushed out the door. They always talk to me with respect, and for as long as I need.
0.720000	I mostly trust my doctors to tell me what is wrong and how to fix it; they don't always agree with me or me them when diagnosing something or trying to get me to take pills or treatments I don't want to take or do. I believe they are genuinely trying to help me, but we don't always agree.
0.800000	I like her because she presents all options and treatments and pros and cons without biasing me towards them and she is open to conventional and non conventional treatments
0.720000	I have seen my doctor make mistakes before treating me. However, he is brilliant and helped keep my children healthy growing up so I give him credit. I feel as though he did overprescribe antibiotics for me, though, as I did end up with C-Diff in the hospital two years ago from prescriptions he wrote on my behalf.
0.440000	It's obvious that my primary care physician, and all the other doctors in that office in general, is ridiculous overworked and overwhelmed.  When I do go see her, I can expect to regularly wait 2 hours past my scheduled appointment time to even see the doctor, only to have her rush through our meeting in 5 minutes and rush me out.  The waiting room for my primary care physician's office is always filled to the brim with waiting people, many of which sick and coughing.  My doctor means well but she is clearly overworked and unable to give me her best.
0.680000	I do not go to my family doctor often but if I had a health condition that I needed to see him more frequently, my answer might change. Sometimes I feel like doctors are in a hurry to see their next patient that they do not see completely to my needs (which there are very few).
0.720000	"I trust my doctor because she shows genuine concern and often discusses options with me in regards to my treatment. I am only neutral on some issues because I feel that she is very busy, and often is trying to get through things quickly, or discredits certain things I report as ""just my anxiety"" since I have a medical history with it."
0.720000	I do trust my doctor, but I also realize how busy he is.  I have never experienced my doctor making a direct mistake relating to my health, but there have been instances when he was rushing a little.  When I am prescribed something, I always take the time to research the drug and its results/side effects before taking it myself.  I do have faith in his abilities, but will still take the time to do my own research.
0.800000	i trust doctors because they know more than i do. i do not know what is wrong with me, just that something is not right. they have gone to school and received training to be able to help me, so i try to trust that they will not lead me astray. I have had mostly good experiences with doctors in the past, so i cant complain
0.600000	In all honesty, I do not currently have a primary care physician as I do not have health insurance. In general, I do trust the health profession however
0.560000	I just think that most doctors just want to get done with one paitent and then move on to the next. I also don't think that they listen very attentatively when you tell them something that doesn't agree with their preconceptions of the person they think the patient is.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she is the one who went to medical school and I am not, and because I am in good health after seeing her for medical problems. All my problems have always been resolved by going to the doctor so I have no reason not to trust her.
0.560000	I have never been very close with any of my physicians, and I have had several miserable experiences with medical bureaucracy/billing, so I am more apt to view my exchange with a physician as a business exchange. 
0.880000	I have been with my family Dr. for almost 20 years now. I know that he has my best interest at heart. 
0.440000	I do trust that our primary care physician is capable of making proper decisions involving health care if they were to take the time to do so. Often, issues are misdiagnosed or overlooked because they are in a rush. The same goes for the doctors support system, such as office staff. Many times they are so busy that they overlook completing there tasks such as calling in prescriptions or referrals.
0.520000	not forthcoming with info and seem to rush through appointments.  Also, don't seem interested in the causes of medical conditions or events.  Not interested in probing further
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like that I can tell them what I need to tell them. I trust in what ever I need to say to the doc.
0.520000	I believe they are trying to do a good job but the problem is they are always over booked so you have to be your own advocate and try to understand your condition.  You should also ask questions you have in mind.  After all it is your own body and your own health.  
0.720000	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy. As human beings, they do have biases, and they do make mistakes, so it's important for patients to educate themselves, ask questions, and so on, but on average I feel people in the medical profession can be trusted to know how to do their jobs.
0.600000	I have confidence and trust in my PCM, but I also have to weigh his recommendations against my own philosophy of life, and compare his diagnosis to what I research online form other experts in the field.
0.680000	My primary care physician is more interested in prescribing medication rather than preventative care. I feel like all he ever wants to do is give me some drug other than give me better life habit talks.
0.760000	My primary care physician has proven himself to be reliable, knowledgeable, and if was unsure about something would admit it and find out the information. That is why I can trust him because he is willing to admit when he doesn't know and willing to find out the information. That how I know I have a good doctor because he doesn't have a god complex.
0.640000	He seems to know what he is talking about when it comes to my health. He does take the time to ask questions and does a thorough checkup. What I find that frustrates me is he never calls back and it is hard to get an appointment.
0.400000	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I think that medicine can be trendy and when my primary reccomends a procedure or exam that I think is unecessay I usually go with my gut feeling.  I have not taken certain test ie colonostomy for example because I don't believe the risk however so small is worth the possible pay off.  This is a procedure that is now common but I feel unecessary in most cases.
0.760000	Overall I trust the doctors I have see.  However, the last time I made a Dr's appt. the office scheduled me with  a PA, I did not like this because no one told me I wasn't seeing an MD,  therefore at this practice I they were not being truthful or honest with me, and will not be using this practice again. This did cause me to distrust them.
0.800000	I feel that even though doctors are busy and rushed, and can't always possibly have enough time in the day, or in general, to give you the individualized attention you seek, they still know you depend on them. They value the importance you place on them and what they can provide, and they have a moral code that they abide by to make sure they give the best care possible. I know that doctors are also capable of making mistakes, and some doctors are better than others, but it would be an impossible task oftentimes to be able to find a doctor that would be able to give you the best individualized care and information possible in a manageable timeframe. It often feels like it's not necessary, either, as in most cases, with most people's problems, most doctors will suffice.
0.200000	I have known my PCP since I was born. My parents really liked him, but I never was comfortable around him. At times he would send me for too many tests and other times he wouldn't send me enough. He never seemed to care about me, just what made him feel important. The Physician Assistants in his office are just as bad, if not worse. Just recently I switched my PCP and have an upcoming appointment with my new PCP 
0.520000	Sometimes doctors lie for their own benefit, it is bad but it is definitely true. I do not fully trust them
0.680000	I feel like my doctor cares, but is also very busy. Sometimes it feels like a whirlwind once she's in the room with me. She always asks if I have any questions before she leaves, but sometimes I feel so caught up in the pace that I can't really think of anything at the time. It's nice that her office has an online portal that I can send in a message and get a response from a nurse after the fact. 
0.800000	I trust my medical doctor because she is a person that has been there for me throughout my entire life and has always done everything that she can to make sure that I feel comfortable and get well as soon as possible. I know that I can ask my doctor questions about anything and everything and that she'll try her best to answer whatever it is that I want to know without any kind of hesitation. My doctor is someone that I feel will always have my best interests in mind.
0.600000	I changed to a new doctor last year. I have only seen him once. He seems professional and capable. On the whole, doctors have treated me effectively. But I still feel I need to ask lots of questions to make sure I understand what they are doing.
0.920000	My husband and I are currently going through fertility treatment so my primary care physician is a reproductive endocrinologist. She has an amazing track record of helping people get pregnant. She genuinely cares about us and celebrates victories and mourns losses with us. This makes me trust her and her opinions so much more.
0.920000	He has been my primary care physician for my entire life. He has never let me down in the past so I have no reason to expect him to in the future. He is a reliable person overall.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because when I told him about my coughing and inability to breathe, he actually took me seriously, unlike the previous three. Now I have two inhalers (maintenance steroid and emergency albuterol) that help me breathe better. That's all I want from a doctor: mutual respect enough to take me seriously when I say something is a problem. (And he doesn't pathologize my sexuality, which also helps.)
0.760000	I have had a longstanding relationship with my primary physician. He is knowable, experienced, intelligent and open. I feel comfortable discussing my health with my doctor as he is patient, kind and wise. I do, on occasion disagree with my physician and in most cases feel comfortable letting him know of and why I might disagree with him. Some times I may not speak up, and I guess that goes somewhat under the category of distrust but all in all I do trust my doctor. As far as other doctors are concerned, my trust level is on a case to case basis.
0.720000	The reasons why i trust my physician is because i have known him for a while. He has always been honest with me and my care. For that reason he is my daughters doctor as well.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he is willing to answer my questions even as far fetched as they might be, he takes the time to listen to what I have to say
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because first off, he always remembers me, even when I have not seen him in quite some time. He is very personable towards me and makes me feel comfortable. He allows me to express what I feel that I need before making his own professional recommendations.
0.760000	I trust my doctor. He knows much more than i do. Always explains everything, even if i don't ask. I don't think he cares more about what is convenient  for him
0.440000	I have a medical condition with my back that no doctor has yet been able to help with. The last doctor I saw about this had me as a patient for two years. I followed his advice, consented to treatments, and did everything as he wished it and got 0 results. At the end he decided that he didnt know what was wrong with me exactly and I stopped seeing him. It only took thousands of dollars in treatments for him to figure out that the cash cow was dry. 
1.000000	Speaking to my doctor is like speaking to a family member. He's very open and honest, but has a very warm bedside manner. He makes me feel very relaxed, and I know he always has the best suggestions for my health and well-being.
0.920000	It's not a business that has a lot of corruption or under-the-table payments, so doctors have little reason to lie or sway you in a direction that's not beneficial to you.
0.760000	My doctor is patient and takes the time to answer any questions I might have. I never feel rushed in his office. He also never seems pushy, and gives me all of my potential options. He's never pushed a medication or treatment on me. His bedside manner is excellent.
0.840000	I trust my doctor to know what is right for me because she generally chooses the option that she knows will be covered with insurance and tries to get me the best treatment while also considering my financial situation.
1.000000	My primary care physician has always been there for more over the years. I have been seeing him for almost 10 years now. He always cares about my well being and does everything he can to make sure I am in good physical and mental health.
0.480000	They spend so little time with patients that it's very tough to get to know a person's individual lifestyle and complete health profile. There is a lot of pressure to see many patients in a day which burdens doctors and leads them to rushed decisions.
0.680000	I have had concerns dismissed before without a good explanation, which is why I don't have 100% trust in my doctors, however, most of the time my doctor is willing to listen to me and provide the information that I need.
0.760000	"i trust most doctors, it depends on how they 'deal"" with me. As long as theyre willing to answer questions and not rush you out."
0.760000	I just started going to a new primary care physician this summer.  I was very impressed.  She took 15-20 minutes to just sit down and get to know me and my health history.  She seemed very knowledgeable and was very easy to talk to.
0.520000	I have a chronic illness. Most doctors are quick to say nothing is wrong or that its all in your head when they can't find anything upfront. Most doctors have told me this, and then my last doctor diagnosed me with Epstein Barr. I have recently started seeing a new doctor and I don't know how I feel about her yet.
0.680000	I feel that my doctor has my best intentions in mind. He helps me to feel better every day and prevents me from getting sick. I have full trust in  him.
1.000000	My doctor has on multiple occasions spent more time with me than she had to to make sure I'm content or that she figures out what proper course of action is. If she doesn't know something she tells me and then seeks out other sources of information to help her make an informed decision.
0.720000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she has been with my family for many years. She took over a practice from another older physician that helped my mother and needed to retire. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor since they have the ability to know and they have the perspective to know whats going on
0.800000	I trust my doctor, although we have disagreed on the best treatment options in the past. I do not always think that a pill is the cure, while he tends to prescribe medications for everything. I do think he looks out for me though and has my interests in mind.
0.840000	I have been working with her for a while so we've built up some level of trust. She seems very involved and concerned in my well being every time I meet with her. We go over all aspects of my care each time we meet, and she truly tries to help me solve the issues at hand. 
0.880000	I trust our primary care physician but prefer to deal with her exclusively and not her Physician Assistants. The PA's that work at her medical office aren't quite as knowledgeable and don't provide the same level of thorough analysis required for our day to day health needs.
0.400000	It's just one person, and a single person can be wrong despite having good intentions. I would much rather know the opinion of multiple doctors or people with experience.
0.680000	I trust them to use the knowledge they have or to refer me to another who is more specilized. I would distrust if they felt they could handle all troubles.
0.720000	I trust my family doctor. He has been working with myself and other family members for many years. I am an active, healthy individual, so when something is wrong, I trust him to provide and recommend treatment.
0.760000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with this same doctor since I was a child and he has been very courteous and helpful with my medical needs. My doctor is located in a small facility so there are not that many patients he sees in a day. The care is very personal and positive. He has a way of talking to people that is very relaxing and comforting to everyone he sees. There has never been a time that I have doubted the advice or treatment he has given me.
0.760000	She is open to new studies and information. She listens to me. She stays on top of new information as much as she can herself. She will consult with others. 
0.680000	My doctor seems like a sincere individual who would not do anything to intentionally harm me.  He also seems to enjoy his job and be highly qualified.  He does not get frustrated when you ask him questions, and always has an answer ready.  Nonetheless, if i had a serious medical issue, i would of course get a second or third opinion.  This isnt because i distrust my doctor, it is just because i feel it would be the smart thing to do.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because my questions are always answered. I feel like I. Always taken seriously no matter the situation.  When something is wrong he always goes above and beyond to figure out whatâs the matter. I always feel like I can open up about whatâs wrong and not feel embarrassed. 
0.680000	I recently switched to a new primary care physician and am working on building trust after a previously bad experience with my former doctor. I also have intense anxiety and distrust in general.
0.840000	My doctor has always taken the time to sit and talk with me about any concerns I have regardless of the time crunch on her part.  She will walk me through different steps to take and even calls days later to check in to see how we are doing.
0.800000	I have been through a surgery with him and have had good results. He openly shares the good and the bad and the tough things.
1.000000	my primary care physician is very direct and honest about all aspects of my health and well being. my primary care physician always takes the time to make sure that i know exactly what is going on and that i have all the information that i need, and that i know what all of my options are.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she has always been open and honest with me. She listens to me carefully and is gentle and kind and patient with me. She's fairly young as well, which I like. She's not judgmental of me
0.520000	"I mainly distrust my primary care physician because about a year ago I was told I ""needed"" to get the HPV vaccine, which I declined after reading the side effects and there is no need for me to get it, I was left in the hospital room for 1 hour with ""reading materials"" on it and I had to go get my doctor so I could leave."
0.520000	I think that pharmaceutical companies have an unethical amount of control over doctors prescriptions and treatment methods for patients and most people are not inclined to bite the hand that feeds.
0.640000	I do not feel the doctors are very careful in doing exams. Sometimes they did not make the right dignosis.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician as they have been the primary for my entire life, he's a great doctor who is very understanding and always willing to listen and pitch multiple ways of dealing with whatever is ailing me. 
0.800000	As I mentioned earlier, I always wanted to be a doctor growing up and I even went as far as to enroll premed for 4 full time college years before I changed my mind.  I did not do this for money.  I did this because being a doctor always appealed to me.  I like to solve problems and the human body and what it is capable of astonishes me.  I like to think that most if not all doctors got into medicine for the same reasons.  They want to build that trust with their patients.  Without patients, they have no practice so I have to believe that they are to be trusted or else they would not have gone into medicine.
0.800000	I have had a relationship with my primary care physician for many years.  Throughout those years I have never had a reason to question his care.  He is a straight shooter and tell you what you need to hear whether you want to hear it or not.
0.640000	I am woman who has given birth twice, i know what it is like to have a doctor want to induce labor because he will be on vacation on your due date. I have had nurses deny me crutches because they didn't believe my pain level. everyone is human, just because you work in the medical industry does not make you infallible.
0.800000	I generally trust my primary care physician because he is a friend of my family, and also my in laws. He asks how family is doing.  He is knowledgeable about any issues brought up, and is open to discussing all options available.  He is friendly and kind.  I don't feel that he is ever in a rush to get out of the appointment, and move on to other patients.
0.720000	No matter how disinterested my doctors have seemed sometimes, I still have faith in their expertise to provide me with the right evaluations. Even though you get treated like a piece of furniture in healthcare clinics, the doctors are still good.
0.760000	My issue is less a trust of the doctor themselves, and more of an institutionalization of thought. There are other ways to heal/treat people than what is typically catered to in a hospital, although a Doctor may not always be aware of them.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because we went to the same school and he seems like an honest and reasonable guy that I feel that i can relate to. He understands that i have a good knowledge of my health
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I have my reasons for this. I trust my doctor because he will listen to me when I have questions that I need to ask. He is very generous and makes me feel like I'm important. I've been seeing my doctor for years now and never have I felt that I could not talk to him. I've been quite worried about a lot of things in the past and he has assured me that I was going to be alright.
0.560000	I trust my doctor in that I trust him or her to not harm me in any way. But in a world of referrals, its often easier to ship me off to a specialist and still charge me, then to actually do things that will help me. Sometimes a specialist can be the right call, and sometimes its just convenient for the doctor.     
0.840000	 My primary care physician at this time is very patient and open to explaining things to me in ways I can understand.   She takes the time I need to make sure I am comprehending what she's explaining.   I feel safe asking her anything. 
0.720000	Doctors go through so many years of schooling and training and they are so knowledgeable you have to trust them.
0.400000	I feel that many doctors are overworked and don't necessarily care about wellbeing of patients.  They are also at the mercy of insurance and pharmaceutical companies.  It is a sad day, because I remember when it was the other way around and doctors did what was best for their clients.
0.640000	Regarding doctors in general (I haven't seen a primary care physician in many years), I feel like I can trust them somewhat. As I've gotten older though, I think I've become more skeptical about doctors, knowing that, for example, doctors get a higher kickback on certain drugs or treatments than others, so there is a benefit to them to get you to take a particular treatment option. I still trust doctors in diagnosis, but treatment I'm more skeptical. 
0.440000	Doctors want money and they often push information they are being paid for, like from pharmaceutical companies and whatnot. I really don't know if my doctor knows what is best for me because of all the alternative medications and practices I can read about online. I don't put too much into what my doctor says as they have limited information from their medical school studies.
0.600000	I am assigned a dr through the military and dont really have a choice. I advocate for myself and only see them when sick.
0.760000	I've had several physicians over the years.  Most of them have always been trustworthy.  For example, I was taking ambien for many years for insomnia, and because my doctor truly had my best interest, she stopped filling my script and we opted for a different drug that was less addictive.  I have developed a lot of trust with her.
0.480000	He has made errors before because I have a specific chronic illness and see a separate specialist who treats it. My GP has increased medications to a level that is harmful due to my illness, or prescribed meds or treatments that contradict or react with my other meds. He also put me on three medications to lower my blood pressure at once, which caused my bp to drop so low so quickly that I had seizures.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that we can have made a connection over the past five years. He always tells me how it is with my physical condition and any issues that may be occurring in my life when I visit him. He is thorough with explaining all of my vitals, my lab results, my physical activity, and my history. In addition, he lets me know when I should start doing something different in my eating habits such as eating less fatty and sugary food items. I also think he cares about me when he gives me a serious look and starts critiquing my lifestyle.  
0.560000	I do not currently have a primary care physician.  Doctors that I have visited in the past seem to get stuck on one particular notion and don't listen well to what I feel.  Additionally, they are not interested in whether or not I can afford the test they are prescribing.
0.600000	TRUST A LITTLE BECAUSE THEY ARE DOCTOR'S AND PRETTY SURE THEY DONT WANT TO BE SUED, SO THATS WHY I TRUST THEM. BUT SOMETIMES I DONT BECAUSE THEY JUST MIGHT BE DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.
0.440000	I do not see my primary care doctor very often. I feel like my once a year checkin is not enough for me to build a relationship. 
0.880000	I have a very high level of trust for my primary care physician. I have been seeing him off and on for over a decade now, and he has never been anything but polite, helpful, and understanding. Every time I have an appointment with him he makes sure all of my needs are met and that all of my questions are answered right there. I am very satisfied.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is great - she is very direct and straightforward while also being friendly and pleasant. She does not sugar-coat and is open to my getting second opinions, and she is happy to answer all of my questions (I bring lists). She never seems rushed.
0.960000	My doctors saved my life and I don't believe that 99.99% of doctors would give their patients anything but their best advice and information.
0.640000	My primary care physician is very busy.  I know that he has many patients.   I think he is thorough and careful but sometimes he may miss something due to being busy.   There is always other patients waiting whenever I visit him.  I always feel a bit rushed.   
0.440000	I distrust my primary care physicial somewhat because their primary obligation might not be to me, but instead to their career and their financial obligations.  Plenty of doctors have plenty of lawyers to offset complications of medical errors and other eugenicidal malfeasance.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I feel like he has my best interest and wants the best for me long term in my health.
0.600000	I tend not to trust doctors in general to a great degree. I have list family members to negligent care from doctors. I myself have a rare cardiovascular condition that most local doctors don't know a great deal about and, more importantly, don't try to learn. I feel very afraid overall and cannot be reassured by local doctors because of that reason. I have already had one major heart attack with cardiac arrest so one would think they would pay attention. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor because she always lets me know the truth. Even though she tries to make me feel comfortable, she gives me the negative effects and tells me the truth about what can happen to me if I don't take care of myself.
0.520000	I have had my primary care doctor for 7 years and still to this day have never seen him I have only seen the physician assistant.  She does a great job but I think its funny I have never seen him
0.920000	My doctor is very thorough at explaining my different treatment options and also understands her limitations. After working with her for sometime to find treatment for my migraines she referred me to a specialist who was able to help.
0.560000	I have little trust in doctors because in me experience, they have been very money orientated. They schedule more and more appointments, not because they care about you, but how much your insurance will pay them for each visit.
0.440000	A doctor just does not have time to provide a high level of service to every patient, even if they are motivated to do so. They are also subject to fatigue, influence from drug manufacturers, and biases. Sometimes their knowledge can be outdated, if they are decades into their career, or too green, if they are brand new doctors. 
0.800000	I have a military doctor, and I always think that being in the military, you can't always mess up things and you always think about the servicemember, and not your own self or convenience.
0.720000	Most doctors have the best in mind for you. I usually trust most doctors and because I can often understand what is going on, I can agree or disagree and understand rationale because of my health care background. Very rarely do I find a doctor that I don't trust at all, if at all. Sometimes they aren't the most thorough, but if I feel the need to tell them to assess something, I will. I keep open communication and talk with them frequently, especially in the patient room and clarify things that I don't understand or need more explanation. 
0.800000	My doctor has been in the area for a very long time.  My husband and I both go to him.  He has actually helped find the right diagnoses for something that has been overlooked for many many years.  He is thorough and takes his time talking to me about what I am there for.  He is well respected in the area.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he always listens to me and my concerns.  They have always been good at diagnosing and treating my illnesses.  They also make sure my prescriptions are always available for refills if necessary.
0.760000	Because we've known each other for a long time now and all of the treatments I've done from him have had no issues up to this point.  I trust my doctor to make the best recommendations for me and keep me healthy.
0.360000	Although currently I do not have a primary care provider, I have had many MANY throughout my 22 years of existence and there were so many that didn't know what the heck they were talking about. When I can go online and find medical documents from the actual US government along with WHO and the CDC to name a few, showing contradictory information to what I am told by a doctor, it starts to shake your faith in em. Then we also have to get into the deeper part of, do we trust the government? Do we trust WHO or the CDC? And if we do, should be believe them over our own doctors? Should we trust our doctors medical training was equal to or superior to the training of those that work for the government? Can we trust those workers even have credentials and how easily can that be faked or covered up? As you can see the reasons run very very deep and is much more than I care to type here.
0.760000	I have a new doctor that I do not know very well. She is very friendly and seems competent. However, I would still ask questions to be sure that the right decisions were bring made about my health. I would never just blindly trust my doctor without understanding the information.
0.960000	We selected our primary care physician based on a recommendation from our daughter after we moved. We have been completely satisfied with the family practice (my wife and I have different doctors in the practice). From day one, I got along well with my physician. We bonded, I think, partly because I was teaching at his alma mater (after retiring from my full-time position elsewhere). He will lay out various treatment options in a fair and unbiased way and leave the decision to me. Have never ever felt rushed. He takes the time that is necessary and we also toss in a discussion of sports, which is fun and makes me feel very comfortable (especially compared to some snooty specialists I have met over the years).
0.680000	I generally trust my doctor but sometimes I think he just does what is easy and convenient rather than what is necessarily best for me. I feel pretty good overall about trusting my doctor.
0.960000	My doctor is very sincere and always go to the point.  She was very helpful with a health problem I was having for months, do all the tests and then recommended all the procedures available and what she thinks was the best for me.  It was my decision base on the information she gave me about all the procedures, secondary effects and results.  
0.640000	I trust the doctors to do what is best for me and to provide access to the right treatments, but I wish that everything is laid out and simplified.  I would like to just be told of the long term survival rates instead of having to wonder.  I hold myself back from that because i don't want to know.
0.720000	i trust my doctor he has always been there for me and let me know everything that i need to know and explains it to me so i understand it 
0.520000	"i dont have a close relationship with my dr because im relatively healthy. So i only see her once a year. I dont even think she really remembers me. I think she just does a cursory job at my physical. I have had one health problem recently (gall bladder) she just said ""have it out"" she didnt discuss any other options she just referred me to a surgeon."
0.560000	I don't put too much trust in doctors because I know they get kickbacks from certain medications and don't always look out for their patients. I know they mean well, but sometimes they don't do what's best and I don't want to put myself in that risk over something small that I can treat.
0.720000	"I trust my primary care physician because she is thorough. There is no ""t"" uncrossed or ""I"" undotted. She asks all of the necessary questions and has a great bed-side manner. So, by being thorough and caring I completely trust her."
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough and has helped me with a few medical problems that I've had. She is patient and kind.
0.800000	They are my doctor and I do not believe that they would intentionally cause any harm. My doctor has a family and he seems to really care about people. I have no reason to not trust my doctor. 
0.720000	I have never had a reason not to trust my doctors.  I'd rather give them the benefit of the doubt.  
0.840000	I see my nurse practitioner instead of my doctor as my primary care provider.  I trust health care providers that are intelligent and kind and I prefer to understand all aspects before engaging in care.
0.800000	She is quick but thorough, makes sure to explain anything if I need her to, doesnât if I donât, tells me what I should/shouldnât do not what I have to do/not do.
0.600000	I have been to many different doctors and a lot of them have told me that there have been things wrong with me that there were proven to not be. I was diagnosed with something then I went to a specialist that completely disproved the other doctors diagnosis. In my belief the doctor who originally diagnosed me was just trying to get more money from me and have me pay for treatment for a problem that I didnt even have.
0.800000	With the info you give them and the info they have a round then you can stand back and trust then that they are looking out for you
0.480000	I distrust some physicians because they are being paid by drug companies. On top of this they often receive a specific training that I may not agree with. Due to this I am more likely to want to see a holistic or alternative physician that I would trust would be open minded like me.
0.600000	I havent been seeing my primary care physician for too long so it is very hard to gauge my level of trust in her. She is competent but, she lacks warmth. Im not sure I will continue seeing her
1.000000	because mt dr tells me every detail and leaves nothing out. he is straight forward yet compassionate and carindg, and listens to all i say to hm
0.800000	My current primary care doctor is the first to take my concerns seriously. He is doing everything he can for me so that we can find answers for the symptoms I have been experiencing. 
0.520000	I feel that doctors only want to run a lot of tests to make money or over fear of being sued. Doctors are normally very busy and rushed and do not give patients the time and care that they should. I am distrusting of doctors.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because of how long i've known him. he's always welcoming and calming and i've he's always been honest with me and answered all of my questions.
0.640000	In terms of situations that aren't serious sometimes it would seem as though doctors may give a patient the runaround in order to make more money or help out other doctors or institutions.
0.400000	I don't trust my doctors decisions because he is always in a rush when he is visiting patients. He doesn't take the time to explain all my treatment options. When I tell him about symptoms that I have been feeling he doesn't do any tests or anything until months later. 
0.800000	I trust him because of how long I have known him.  It has been so long and I have seen him so many times that the trust grew.  I know about his family and other things about him.  Plus since he has done many procedures on me and I am healthier because of them I trust him.  He has not let me down and is there for me when I need anything including just to talk.  He takes his time with me which is important.
0.720000	I don't put total trust in any man, but for the most part I have a good relationship with my doctor and have been open with her.  We discuss treatments together and i can bring to her new treatments to discuss and together we decide. 
0.560000	I trust somewhat because they are trying.  However, I think they are sometimes rushed and it is difficult to get appointments on time.  I think they try but sometimes are short staffed as well.
0.800000	I like her. I don't know her for very long but she follows up and does what she says she is going to do. She seems trustworthy so far. I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. She seems to care about her patients.
0.680000	I trust doctors to a point, i feel as if some doctors could use a bit more training and i do not always trust them.  All in all i do trust most doctors it just really depends on teh situation 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they always listed, answer my questions, and never seem to rush thru the appointment. If something is wrong, they always make a follow up phone call.
0.800000	I like to think they do the job in order to help me feel better. Admittedly, I have felt a little rushed in a busy office, but I have never felt like they were deliberately being careless. I think they have my best interests in mind, even though I have had some unsuccessful treatments. I think this is a problem of specialization, as some GP's do not have the in depth knowledge to treat specific medical issues. I trust my GP with my overall health in the end.
0.800000	I've seen my doctor for over a decade now, and we get along great.  She's been a good help to me, and as far as I know has not ever guided me wrong.  I have no reason to doubt her. 
0.760000	I trust her, though sometimes I think she rushes me through because I am very healthy.  However, on the whole, if I had a serious problem, I would absolutely trust her to give me the all the options and detail risks and concerns.
0.640000	People can have favorites, flavors, ideas and treatments. So someone can easily get into the routine of recommending a favorite treatments. Also, people can be out of date in their ideas. 
0.560000	Sometimes my doctor give medicine in cases that are unnecessary and set up for appointment after appointment for no reason.
0.800000	"My Dr. is very attentive and willing to talk to you if you have questions. he never pushes any ""drugs"" and always seems to be willing to help you not come bck to his ofice. He is personalble and isdedicated to huis patients. He once saw me without an appointment (ona busy day) because I had no other day in which I could return. "
0.480000	I think that a doctor can make mistakes and sometimes it is easier to hide it from the patient. I have family members that work in a hospital and I already heard many stories that makes me worried about it.
0.520000	Knowledgeable but doctors will rush to see too many patients.  Will not go in depth unless problem is already too far gone. Prevention not a thing with most and don't take their time with each patient.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing the same doctor for various things over several years. I have never received bad advice. I feel like he listens to my statements and questions. I feel like he makes informed and educated decisions about my health.
1.000000	I trust her because she answers all of my questions whether they're dumb or not. She goes through each problem I'm having thoroughly and breaks it down for me so I understand what she's saying. 
0.720000	I think that for the most part, my doctor will recommend what is best for me. However, there are times when the office is very busy. At those times, I do not always feel as though my doctor is fully listening and may be in too much of a hurry for me to feel confident in his recommendations.
0.720000	I trust all the doctors because they graduated because of something, although there are some that do not give me good impression
0.400000	I think doctors treat all bodies like if they are the same. Just because you have heartburn doesn't mean all patients should get the same pill. Doctors should look deeper into what lifestyle changes they can make and maybe certain prescriptions work well for some but not all.
0.280000	In my many years of dealing with people I have never found one I really trust to any great extent, certainly not with my life.
0.520000	I recently had to change primary care doctor's because the one that had been my doctor for many years retired. The new doctor that I have does not seem that dependable. As a matter of fact, I am in the processing of finding a different one.
0.800000	I don't see any reason not to trust him. He's a medical professional who's been to school and been in practice for many years. It's his job to know what he's talking about.
0.360000	SHE DOES NOT LISTEN TO ME. WANTS ME OUT THE DOOR AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. RELYS ON BLOOD WORK AND NOTHING ELSE IT SEEMS. I ASK HER QUESTIONS AND SHE WILL ANSWER A COUPLE, BUT THEN GET SIDE TRACKED EASY OR GET ME SIDE TRACKED SO THAT I DONT ASK THE QUESTIONS AGAIN.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician as I have gone to him for many years and he has always been honest and upfront about any problems or procedures that needed to be done.
0.720000	For a majority of my checkups they have constantly been meager issues that normally do not require a giant leap of faith. They are there and paid to help people I do not see how there's any opportunity to be malicious of any sort considering they're paid well, receive salary and must have some sort of love for their career path. Not to mention every single time I've ever gone to visit my primary care physician they have always assisted me no matter what and been effective each time.
0.880000	I think my doctor does an excellent job of listening to me and following up.  I went in describing symptoms that I did not think added up to anything. She immediately ordered bloodwork for me and we learned that I have hypothyroidism. My doctor appears to really pay attention and I trust that she is working toward my best interests.
0.720000	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part, He does what he can to help me when I come to him with a problem. But one time when I suspected I had a ear infection coming and he said it was my neck. Few days later I had an infection
0.920000	"I use a NP as my primary physician. She is awesome. She spends more time with me than other Doc's do and I never feel ""rushed"" through an appointment. She gives me as much time as I need when I see her. "
0.520000	I know most doctors are in this career for themselves and they'll prescribe high paying medications to profit. There are plenty of times when a doctor tries to rush the patient so they can go from one to the next without a proper diagnosis.
0.680000	For the first few years I had full confidence in my primary care doctor. In the past year or two she has taken on many more new patients, and as a result she is harder to contact and schedule appointments with. She spends less time with me during my appointments and the conversation can sometimes be rushed. I feel like due to time constraints, she often forgets to tell me something, such as a treatment option or type of medication that could be helpful to me. Because of this, I have lost some confidence in her ability as a health care provider.
0.840000	Iâve been seeing Dr Lewis for 11 years. Heâs very direct and to the point but also understanding and has compassion for what he does. 
0.600000	I don't trust my primary care physician because I never hear back from them about test results. Also because I always have to wait forever for her to come back and then feel rushed when she does come in. 
0.520000	I do believe doctors want to help people. The issue I have is hospitals are driven by profit and people can be driven by rewards. So I may have high blood pressure but instead of trying to give me a diet to follow they go right for the medication. They do that because its a pay back to them. If I have pain in my knee the first thing I dont want is an opiod but thats the go to becasue there is so much money in it. So in all I trust them to help but I dont trust them to do it the cheapest or more reasonable way.
0.880000	My doctor is always very thorough when I see him. I've never had any issues with him, like being misdiagnosed or given a medication that I reacted badly to. I've generally had a positive experience with my current primary care physician. I trust that he knows what he is doing. 
0.600000	I wouldn't completely trust my primary care physician or any doctor for that matter. While I have respect for their level of knowledge and expertise doctors are still just people and capable of making mistakes. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I know him very well. He is more than just my physician, he is my friend. The decisions he makes are in my best interest. 
0.680000	It is easy to trust a doctor if they are willing to give you time to talk to them.  Many doctors are in and out so quickly that it's had to even get an impression of them.
0.320000	I usually go to the poor clinic and the doctors there are terrible. The one I saw the most was checking information on his phone to make sure he knew what to do with me. I had no trust in his judgment I got better by checking Internet and finding a cure myself.
0.840000	My primary care physician takes great care of me. She is attentive and remembers details and LISTENS to me. I have seen many other doctors whether walk-in or specialists who do not listen to what I say. If they do not listen to me, they can't possibly diagnose me correctly. If a doctor is dismissive or rude, I won't trust a word out of their mouth.I find a new doctor as soon as possible. Last year, I had a piece of my jaw come loose and fall out of my mouth (it was as horrible as it sounds), in the beginning it just hurt a lot, and I could see my bone through my gums. The male doctor I saw at the walk-in told me there was no way it was my jaw and I probably had a cankersore. I asked him to look and he glanced into my mouth without a flashlight. Yeah, I spat out a piece of my jaw a few weeks later after several appointments with an oral surgeon. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have known him for years, and he has cared for me the to the best of his ability.
0.720000	My PCP is thorough and detail-oriented, but I also feel like he dismisses what he sees as minor issues too easily. He's also quick to send me elsewhere to a specialist if anything even remotely complex comes up.
0.440000	"My current primary care physician worked in an ER. He still has the ""treat and street"" mentality. He will only go over any concern specific to what the appointment was originally scheduled for, and will not allow time to go over any new issues or concerns that I have. "
0.480000	They do not seem to listen to me often about what is wrong. Or think that family history of something is anything more than me being stupid and an huh strung
0.440000	Doctors I like in general, because I feel they honestly want to help others but they have to rely on what they are taught. What they're taught generally doesn't align with my health goals however. I generally expect doctors to prescribe medication of some sort for whatever the ailment might be. I can't trust any decisions that involve me taking medication. If doctors prescribed particular foods and natural things that could remedy the ailment, I may feel differently about trusting their decisions.
0.640000	I have very mixed feelings when it comes to this. I sometimes feel that they are genuinly worried about what is wrong when on the flipside I have had moments where I feel that they are just trying to make it through appoinmtnets or just make quick money. 
0.800000	He has always been honest with me and tried to help me or sent me to someone who could help. He asks if I have questions and answers them. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because she goes the extra mile and has ordered tests be done just to be sure of something she thought. She has passion for what she does and has my health and well being as her top priority. 
0.360000	He always seems busy and does not provide enough details face to face. Depending too much on his staff instead of providing personal care.
0.200000	Because A lot of Doctors have been known to false diagnose a person Blacks are high in that trick.  Example tell someone black they have a lump then who are they to know the future. They say you need to take Chemo therapy we THINK!!! its Cancer. Lies. Then 2 months later they Die. Secretly murdered by a Doctor
0.360000	I used to trust my doctor until last summer.  I took my son to see the Dr. and he said he just has an infection take these pills and get some rest.  I trusted my gut and took my son to the ER and found out that he was a type 1 diabetic and he almost died because the doctor did not diagnose him properly, he spent a week in the hospital recovering.
0.680000	It is someone that I have been seeing for quite some time.  If he does something wrong I think its just from lack of knowledge.  There isn't a lot of time to be spent with each patient.  
0.720000	i've visited my doctor a couple of times and I do feel like they really care about me as a person and want me to be healthy. I've not had any negative experiences with them and plan on continuing to go visit them annually or more often.
0.400000	I do not always trust physicians anymore.  I feel that money and profits are he incentive behind all medical care, and often treatments may be given that do not even help or are sure to fail just to collect the money.  I am beginning to wonder if things like cancer are just big money makers for doctors and hospitals, and there really is no desire for a cure.  I feel that now, more than ever, doctors are not curing people, they just are creating customers that have to come back repeatedly.  Every prescription drug has so many side affects, that other things go wrong with a person, and the doctor is profiting by prescribing certain drugs.  I could be wrong, but I am starting to feel this way.
1.000000	So far everything that my doctor has told me has been one hundred percent open. He hasn't hidden anything from me or told me half truths. I have a lot of trust in him and don't have any kind of doubts of what he tells me. I follow everything what he says. My doctor also answers any question I have, whether it be a dumb one or not. He always answers my questions to the fullest of his ability. I feel I can continue trusting him in dealing with my health. That is why I trust my doctor in whatever he tells me.
0.480000	Doctors are paid to tell you what they think you want to have done.  They don't really care about what is best for you, they want you to do what is going to make them the most money.  They are also paid by pharmaceutical companies to push certain drugs on you that you probably don't need.
0.680000	I trust him to an extent, I mean i do go to him because he knows more about my body and what could be wrong with it, however he is pretty fresh out of school so he still lacks experience.
0.680000	I always trust my doctor. He has helped me deal with some very important health issues and always been so easy to recover. He is over all very very polite and very careful at my disorders.
0.800000	i trust my primary care physician because when i see her she calls personally to give me my test results and after and before examinations she always asks a ton of questions about my health to make sure that I'm healthy and i understand everything she said and the things we discussed
1.000000	I trust mu doctor because he is thorough.  He explains all the possibilities and potential consequences when making a diagnosis and offering treatment.  He then asks allows me to make the decision given the information presented.
0.640000	I generally trust that my doctor is trustworthy however during my pregnancy I did feel that I wasn't always presented with all the information or options due to her preconceived notions about my twin pregnancy and age. 
0.600000	I've only seen her a couple times but she seems really nice but I'm not sure how thorough she is. They are busy so who know how much they actually think about each patient
0.760000	I like and generally trust my PCP as a person, because he seems honest and he really does know a lot.  However, looking at him as a physician, I can't honestly say that I trust any doctor completely.  This is mainly because of the constraints put on them by insurance and ideology as well as the influence of Big Pharma, but it also has to do with their patient load and how exhausted they might be.  I know I don't think well when I'm exhausted, and neither will any doctor.  
0.680000	she is more than willing to answer any questions, and seems like she knows her stuff, thought I feel like she could care more for me, spending more time when I visit.
0.800000	My primary care physician has been very effective in treating my present health issues to such an extent that my condition has greatly improved in a remarkably short period of time. Of course, I played a role in following the instructions; it is, after all, a cooperative effort. Her guidance and approach has been first rate.
0.520000	In general, I see doctors as people doing a job. A PCP does not usually have deep knowledge about whatever specific problem you're having, but they are able to refer you to a specialist who can possibly help you if you need it. PCPs are basically drug dealers for the pharmaceutical companies.
0.840000	I trust his expertise when it comes to health and what he has to say to me. Normally doctors have a great degree of training and experience. Now and then they may mess up but it is rare. My particular doctor i trust very much and he would always be honest with me.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I feel he knows much more about medical care than I.  If he doesn't have an answer to a medical problem he will send me to another doctor that can help me.
0.960000	I always trust my doctor because there is no reason not to. She went to many years of school to do what she does, and she took an oath. She looks out for my health.
0.680000	For the most part I trust that my doctor has my best interest in mind.  But I also know that I am one of many patients for him.  He is often following the protocols that he has to follow and does not know me as well as I know myself.
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician, but not too much. I always try to get answers from multiple sources, so I never fully go with what one individual says.
0.760000	I have no reason to mot trust him. He has been p[en gentle kind and sesitive to my conditions. I have no doubts about my trust in him
0.720000	I trust the doctor will help me make the best decision for my health. However, they are human and have feelings sometimes that influence their opinion. 
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he's never given me a reason to distrust him.  I don't believe he values me above all else, and certainly he cuts corners/time/doesn't explain EVERY possible option every time, but he always tells me the relevant information I need.
0.800000	I love my Primary Care Physician. I had been to a ton of doctors and was miserable. I saw her twice and she figured out what had wrong with me for a long time. One medication completely changed my life. She saved me. I trust her completely. But doctors in general, I only half trust them. You never know when you get a screwy one. 
0.960000	I have a basic knowledge of the medical field, they went to school for this, therefore their knowledge trumps mine.
0.760000	While I do think that the current health care system puts too much importance on volume of patients seen per day, overall, doctors want to contribute to healing their patients and making sure they are as healthy as possible.
0.800000	I don't have a primary care physician but generally trust doctors. Most doctors, I believe, go into their profession because they are interested in helping people. Still I am sure to research treatments outside of my time at the doctor's office. Even when doctors are perceived as trustworthy, I think it's important to be informed and proactive in your treatment.
0.720000	I trust my primary physician to do her best but no one is perfect and everyone has flaws, so I don't completely trust her because she can make a mistake due to human error.
0.400000	they don't really know much more than i do and they treat us all like commodities if they see one condition in one person and the same condition in another person they treat it like the same thing but it is not they are just humans.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I see him every day at work, and we have a friendship outside of work. If you can't trust someone at happy hour, then where can you trust him? Especially when it comes to doctors. 
0.720000	I feel slightly distrustful of them because they need to push certain diagnosis and drugs and are overworked and overbooked.
0.840000	He has always been correct in the past.  He treats me with respect.  He does not order unnecessary tests, but does order those that cannot or should not be avoided.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because she genuinely seems like a good person, based on my past interactions with her. Though, between you and me, I wish she'd check my man parts during physicals like my old male doctor did.
0.760000	Thus far the recommendations of my Dr.(s) have been a positive and appropriate. I had a condition a few years ago and my OB-GYN recommended I start a daily medication. I don't like to take medications if I can avoid it but after following his advise my health improved and I have not had any problems with this condition in 2 years. 
0.720000	He gives it to you straight.  Very thorough. Sometimes he is took much about treating the symptom rather than solving the real problem causing the symptom. He is open to alternative medicines.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she takes her position seriously and tries her best to make thoughtful and accurate diagnosis's. 
0.680000	I generally don't trust people, but my primary care doctor seems pretty trustworthy. She tells it straight up and that's important to me.
0.440000	Most doctors have a patients best interest at heart but many have become nothing but car sales man that deal out drugs because of kickbacks and free samples
0.760000	"Other than those who wish others did not think I do not know what trust is.  I have severe problems with medical professionals as with all fields and would never trust anyone in any ""position"".  The idea itself upsets me."
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough. She runs extensive tests when needed and rules out the worst possible scenario first. She takes time to talk with me, explain things and answer questions.
0.400000	I trust him because he is qualified. HIs advices in the past have been good for me. I have benefitted from listening to his advices.
0.800000	I expect most doctors, especially ones I have carefully chosen to see, to be an expert in their field, to know what they are talking about. Most people go into situations thinking this about doctors. I am generally trusting of the doctors that I see, unless they give me reasons to not think this.
0.840000	I have a new Dr. He has been very thorough to let me know that I have his time and will be upfront and honest when it comes to my medical needs. 
0.640000	I generally trust what the doctor says.  Sometimes I have doubts because I spend so little time actually talking to them I feel like they dont have a complete picture of me and my problem.
0.520000	My mother is a doctor. I love my mother very much, but I realize that doctors aren't magicians, and they are very much people too. I see her run short on patience for her patients---I see how things like drug seeking behaviour make her suspicious of many patients. I think many doctors probably feel this way, and it makes me wary of trusting them. 
0.200000	EVERY altercation I have had with a doctor, I have felt like they aren't really listening to me. They will look at their clip board and nod their head and stuff, but not actually hear what I'm saying. If they ask me a question and I don't answer it the way they think, they will say I'm lying. I dislike Doctors so much because they ALL just do the bare minimum and don't treat people like humans, but as another task before lunch break. 
0.720000	They are highly educated so I trust them, however, anyone can have a bad day where they don't do their jobs well.  Doctors are no exception to these rules.  They some times are going to make bad calls and so I can't 100% trust any doctor.
0.800000	I have no reason to believe that they do not care about their work and patients. There would be no reason for them to choose such a demanding career if they did not care. They also would have no reason to self sabotage their career. 
0.480000	sometimes he seems like he does not listen to me, he is kind of quirky and i call him spaceman. i tell him something and he goes on to the next subject like he did not hear what i said.
0.480000	I don't think that my doctor hears what I am saying all of the time.  I also feel like the answer to everything with him is a new medication.  I would prefer to try and solve health issues without medication first.
0.400000	I distrust my primary care physician because I have gone to them before about an issue and they could not give me any answers, years later I went to a specialist and they were able to tell me what it was immediately. I kind of think my doctor is incompetent and doesn't care for me much. I also think a lot of doctors are just there to make money and only recommend medications that sponsor them. 
0.480000	Its not so much a matter of Trust or Mistrust.  It's not black and white like that.  Its about enhancing and verifying information.  Just because I verify a doctors findings through my own research doesn't mean I do not trust them.  I'm um....Intuitive.
0.720000	A primary care physician is a physician who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis. Since recently, the term is primarily used in the United States. In the past in the US and still in the United Kingdom (and in many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is general practitioner.
0.360000	They're out for themselves. Whatever brings in the money to pay off their student loans is what matters, especially the kickbacks from pharmaceuticals . The American people are just cattle strolling into their butcher shop.
0.960000	I trust my primary physician because I've seen him ever since I was an early teenager. He knows me very well and a lot of my habits both good and bad. He was critical in getting through high school and college with all the necessary vaccines and STD prevention tools, and has always been very open and engaging. It's almost like talking to an old friend where you feel like you can be yourself and open. This really helps in getting across to each other better, and allows him to more easily attune his prescriptions and medical diagnosis' to my situations. I think a lot of people tend to see their doctor as just a means to get medication when they need it, but I think a lot of people fail to realize just how beneficial it can be to have a doctor you trust and is willing to go that extra mile to help you.
0.400000	My PCP is too nonchalant about my medical conditions and has ignored my high blood pressure in multiple appointments. He is also fat and diabetic, so...
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician for 100%. We have a relationship for 3 years now where I have been through some health problems. She has always helped me on a basis of honesty and telling me openly what the options wheree. She also gave me a great deal of input in the decisions that had to be made.. 
0.600000	I'm a skeptic by nature, and I know that human beings are prone to making mistakes. However, I trust that my primary physician's medical knowledge is much better than my own, so I respect his judgement and analysis. As with anything, I like evidence and data-based reasons to believe and trust things. As long as he can provide that to me, I'm likely to trust more. Otherwise, I remain skeptical by nature. Even so, I am likely to take his advice even if I disagree with it, if it may end up benefiting me, and the risk is low. If it's a matter of life and death and I don't like his judgement, I may try to find a second or third opinion.
0.800000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY HAVE MORE ACKNOWLEDGES AND MORE EXPERIENCES. I THINK THEY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO HELP ME GET BETTER HEALTH.
0.480000	I typically trust my doctor but there are times that the prescribed treatment seems inadequate. It's good to find a doctor that you like and trust. It takes a while but a doctor that is willing to put time in with you could be a lifesaver.
0.800000	I have had nothing but a stellar experience for 8 years with my primary doctor.She has gone above and beyond her duties when I have concerns, I completely trust her.
0.800000	I feel like most doctors have the patients best interests in mind.  I know some doctors are only here for the pay and try to make money any way possible but, I tend to have a lot of faith in people and trust doctors unless they give me a reason not to.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for years and so has other members of my family. She has always given me the medical advice that I need and I trust her to do what is best for me. She is always open to any questions that I have and is able to explain things that I may not understand. If I happen to not understand she has no problem giving me more info. She tells me if I have any questions to not hesitate to call her. That puts me at ease if I need to call again for anything follow up questions she is there and if she is not there is always another doctor or nurse to help me,
0.800000	I get a strong sense from my physician that he truly listens to me, wants to engage my thoughts, and has my best interests in mind. Moreover, my questions are welcome and his explanations are clear. This is why I trust my physician. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable about my conditions.  She's also a great listener and asks me thorough questions to get to the bottom of things.  I've never had a problem with her, nor have I been given any reason  not to trust her.  She gets my input before all procedures.
0.320000	I feel that since the practice I go to has switched/been bought by or covered by a certain medical group, the quality of care has greatly declined, and I've noticed several subtle and some not so subtle changes for the worse. I have gone in so many times trying to figure out what is causing my body some negative problems (pain, easily fatigued, etc) and I just keep getting the run around, it seems. I am considering finding a medical practice that hasn't yet been bought out or taken over by the specific umbrella medical group, which has been difficult. I don't believe that prescription drugs that just bandaid a situation are the answer. I don't like to take a bunch of Rx, and would appreciate some direction from my physicians, but haven't gotten much help in that dept.
0.800000	I have a general positive trust for my doctor. I don't think she'd ever intentionally give me misinformation or mislead me. I've never had a concern with this and feel like she's always helpful and informative.
0.600000	I really dont trust them because they never give natural remedies. They always go straight to medicine which is not good for your body. 
0.440000	I don't en general trust very many doctors, too often they are misdiagnosing or diagnosing based on getting paid from drug companies. I don't want unnecessary treatments or drugs. 
0.680000	I have experienced hospital and doctor errors so I am now far more careful.  Those errors were significant -- such as not doing a screen of the chest of my husband when he had head/neck cancer, a failure that impacted the treatment given him.
0.560000	I trust my primary care doctor, but I know that she doesn't know how to deal with my real life problems.  She keeps telling me to go to a counselor, but when that is not an option for your patient, you have to have other options available to them.  She has not been able to help me beyond the basic physical ailments I have.  She is not any help emotionally or able to advise me where I can get the kind of help she thinks I need.  It's a weird situation. 
0.920000	My doctor has never shown me a reason to distrust her. When I visit her, she never makes me wait long, she is timely and responsible to any issues I have. If I call her office for a refill, I never have to make a second call like at some doctor's offices. Her staff are professional and responsive. I am quite happy with my primate care physician.
0.720000	I trust my physician because he has been my primary doctor for many years. He listens to me and doesn't judge me regardless of my habits. He always tries to provide the best guidance possible.
0.840000	I trust them because I know along with experience and schooling they have the know how to take care of me. I have not had a negative experience yet with my doctor so no reason to distrust them.
0.920000	I think there are so many laws now that the doctors and my doctor are very thorough and honest. It also helps he is very kind and respectable. 
0.720000	Doctors are people too, typically I believe they are trustworthy and what they say is knowledgeable but they can still have areas where they do not know much about, like nutrition. Also, doctors are heavily lobbied by pharmacy reps to peddle their product.
0.920000	My primary care provider is always careful in prescribing medication, since I take so many of them (20+ prescription meds). She listens to my concerns, is always thorough in her examination of me, and never makes me feel like I'm just another line item on her checklist. While I've been treated by everyone at the practice, I like her the best.
0.440000	i suspect that doctors in general are influenced by financial interests when recommending treatment options and prescribing medication. i also suspect that many doctors make assumptions without thorough examination sometimes because of heavy workloads or personal bias.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he seems very knowledgeable whenever I need to consult him.  He has been the doctor of my mother and grandparents for a number of years and has always done right by them.  I find that when I communicate clearly with him he is easy to understand and is easily able to diagnose my issue.
1.000000	My doctor has always shown care and concern for me. She has never once brushed aside my feelings or acted as if I was stupid. She has always taken time to answer my questions. 
0.840000	My primary care physician never makes me feel rushed when I have an appointment. She listens to my concerns and always asks if I have questions. I believe she is intelligent and keeps up with new developments in medicine.
0.760000	For the most part, I trust her because she is a doctor and hasn't given me reason not to yet. However... we did just switch doctors and have only seen our current doctor twice. We had to switch due to insurance coverage, but our previous doctor I had been with for 5 years and trusted completely. I hope to develop the same relationship with our current family doctor.
0.240000	I was in extreme pain for a very long time when I finally decided to go to the doctor. I told my doctor where my pain was and how extreme it was. At first she treated me for something way off. Of course I was still very sick and hurting. I went back and told her what she treated me for was not right at all. So she sends me home with a bunch of muscle relaxers which made me sick. After 2 months of trying to follow her patient plan I went back. I begged her to refer me to a specialist and it turned turns out I was right and she was wrong.This is why I do not trust doctors. There are several times when they are wrong.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is kind and competent. They care about me and my health. They are concerned about any issues I have. We have good communication between us as well. She is also very concerned about other parts of my life as well.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because i have known them my entire life. I can understand some people not trusting doctors in general because it seems a lot more of them these days are just trying to make every dollar they can off of their patients. 
0.560000	I canât say that I have complete trust in my doctor. I know my doctor cares to talk me through my concerns and issues but there have been times that I have felt that my doctor was not as talkative or seemed to be in a hurry more than other times. My doctor has at times discussed different things to try for me and told me the good and bad about the treatments and Iâve never felt that she tried to push anything on me just explaining the benefits and so forth and let me take it from there.
0.800000	he is always friendly, upfront about anything I ask him. He always gives me an honest opinion about medications and leaves it up to me if I should take them or not.
0.600000	My physician is quite busy and this can lead him to be curt or even impatient when asked for options or explanations. He normally thorough in his treatment but can get antsy when asked to explain himself or to clarify something he has said. I think he assumes that people will give his schedule as much priority as he does.
0.600000	There is a hidden agenda in the medical practice in which medications are pushed for revenue, this is not necessarily a bad thing but it does make one accept most pill-based medications with a grain of salt.
0.560000	I always find that I have to do more research about different treatments for any ailments I might have.  I don't find that my doctor spends enough time talking to me about choices of medications or options for treatments.  I always feel rushed and that my doctor is not confident enough to recommend any treatments or anything to me regarding my health.
0.520000	I like my physician for yearly check ups...but have not had a thorough examination from her after 2 years.  I have very few reasons to see her outside that, but I did disagree with her on one Rx and told her I would not take it. She was fair and said it was my decision, but I am free to question if I don't agree with her. 
0.640000	My seemingly distrust for most doctors comes from experiences of people that are close to me. I've seen doctors misdiagnose or treat for wrong illnesses way too often. I've also seen and heard about them prescribing medicine that was unnecessary.
0.320000	I have repeatedly had issues (not serious) that were not helped by my doctor. I ended up figuring out what would help me, and I got better using alternative or holistic things that completely cleared the issue. I have also been repeatedly prescribed medicine that had severe side effects or addictive qualities, and was not told about it. Because I read - a LOT - I declined to take the meds because of this.
0.800000	My doctor is very willing to spend extra time with me discussing things that I am unclear on or need extra help with. I am able to ask about alternative treatments or additional ideas on how to get better when I am sick or injured. He listens without judgement and shows that he cares.
0.640000	I tend to be trusting of my primary care physician because he seems very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. It seems like he is genuinely interested in trying to help people. Not just get them in an out.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician but sometimes they are so quick in seeing me that I worry about not getting all the care I actually need.
0.880000	I like my doctor very much. He has always been good at listening to me and not rushing through an appointment. He clearly and thoroughly explains the problems and solutions that he diagnoses and makes sure that I completely understand and am comfortable with his actions..
0.760000	I trust my doctor and have a lot of faith in her. I like it that she is a primary care as well as internist.
0.720000	He is highly regarded by those close to me. A lot of friends and family use the same doctor, and have high praise for him as well. 
0.400000	"It seems like doctors are more interested in seeing as many patients as they can in a day than taking time to really think about what a patient is telling them. It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor who didn't seem rushed and eager to hurry up and go on to the next patient. I think because of this they are quick to farm us out to specialists for things that primary care doctors used to be able to take care of in their own offices, and to make snap judgements about a person's condition rather than take the time to think about what else could be wrong. More and more of them will even tell you whatever is wrong is ""stress"" or that they can't find anything wrong with you, but later if you see another doctor they DO find something legitimately wrong."
0.800000	I trust my doctors because  they know more than I do about the situation, and if I express concern they explain the thinking process and differentials that they are concerned about allowing them to reach the conclusions that they do. 
0.640000	My previous doctor let this practice and the partner is now my doctor.  As far as I know he is dependable but I haven't actually seen him for anything.  I see a nurse practitioner when I go there and she is very nice and helpful.  The office is nice and professional so I am assuming the doctor is similar to the other characteristics of the office.
0.760000	In my experywith him he never made any decision or recommended any medical decision that was not for my best
0.600000	I only see my primary care doctor briefly, once per year for a physical. I feel she is polite and knowledgeable, but that she is often dismissive of my concerns. I trust medical professionals who I see on a more regular basis, such as my chiropractor, because they are exposed to me more frequently. I also recently went to urgent care for a matter that my doctor dismissed and received more effective treatment from urgent care. 
0.640000	I trust my doctor in that he listens to my concerns and takes my suggestions into consideration. He is a newer doctor to me and knows I have been dealing with certain heath issues for a while.
1.000000	"I trust my doctor because she gives me answers without ""sugar coating"" anything, she tells me how good or bad things really are. She gives me options as far as what kind of medicines I should take, like how I want to only take medicine in the evening and not any in the morning. If something is not right for me she is very willing to have me try something else. She is not one of those doctors that always has to be right, with rigid opinions. She is flexible and willing to work with me."
0.920000	I have had the same doctor for awhile now so i just know her really well and feel comfortable enough with her to trust her
0.560000	I trust him generally because he does help me a lot. but at the end of the day it is a profession and he needs to make money so sometimes i feel he is in a rush to get to the next patient. that could just be me though also he seems to quick to prescribe meds
0.480000	One primary reason I have lost trust in my PCP is the fact that I have had surgery for the same reason twice now within three years and really need it again.  I went to an emergency room and the physician there asked me why I had to have the same surgery so close together and I couldn't tell him.  He mentioned that it was unusual for that type of surgery.  This made me contemplate a new option when I go back for the same reason.
0.600000	My new doctor is usually very good so I trust him well. However, I feel that doctors in general tend to push certain drugs  even when there are better options available. For instance I have asthma and my doctor pushed a certain inhaler that was more expensive than a cheaper, better option.
0.520000	"I have a lot of medical conditions that I've had most of my life, but I have overlooked because my parents told me they were normal. They were not. Now that I'm talking to my doctor about them I feel as though he thinks I'm a hypochondriac and doesn't take me seriously. I've had chronic soreness my entire life. He doesn't believe me. There are a few conditions that are more ""modern"" that he just doesn't believe in. "
0.800000	My primary care doctor has always put my best interest first. He listens to my concerns and all my symptoms makes sure I have all the appropriate test ran in a timely matter and fully explains everything to me.
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for almost 4 years now, give or take, and he has always been a very very truthful, and integrity based person. He tells it how it is, and he is a doctor who doesn't like to just prescribe medication and be over with it. He takes the time to sit and talk to figure out exactly what the problem is, and if some type of medication is needed or absolutely necessary he will prescribe it. Otherwise we find different ways of dealing with it or try a lower tier of medication than something that could be addictive or hazardous to health. He is a genuine doctor and I have never had any issues with him.
0.360000	My primary physician is fine.  But after my health catastrophe experience, where I had one of the TOP DOCs in the country and refused to do what he recommended, to my everlasting satisfaction, while my wife stood beside and cried, begging me to do what he told me to, I don't trust doctors further than I can throw them.
0.680000	In general I have a great deal of faith in doctors, but I know they are very busy and there is an intense amount of knowledge they would need to synthesize in order to truly be able to find the best course of action for everyone. I believe they try very hard, but from personal experience I know that often several courses of treatment need to be tried before the right one is found. I don't think badly of doctors for this, nor do I think it is from neglect or mal-intent. I think it is just a result of the complicated workings of the body and the fast amoutn of medical knowledge that exists.
0.600000	In general, I trust the profession but physicians are people - they can make mistakes and they may not always interpret symptoms correctly.   The more you interact, the higher the trust level can become.
1.000000	I trust this doctor completely.  She makes sure we get to the bottom of any problems that I am having.  She also like to rule out possibilities when faced with certain symptoms.  She is very caring, kind and listens to what I have to say.  She doesn't talk to me like I'm a child.  She explains everything. 
0.880000	My doctor is honest and open with me. He seems to provide all options regarding care and doesn't refrain from telling me things that may be difficult for me to hear. 
0.760000	My doctors will take the time to research a problem if they're not familiar with it.  They always make sure that I have all the information needed to make an informed decision about any medical conditions that come up. I go to a doctor's office that has multiple doctors in it and don't always see the same one, so it's important to me that they look over my records and are basically on the same page as far as any care is concerned.  We live in a rural area and the doctors communicate with each other in a thorough manner.  When you are referred to a specialist they always get complete information on your condition which saves time for all parties involved.  
0.640000	I trust my doctor to an extent because she has her own motives as well. Sometimes nothing is wrong  but she is addresses it because she wants the additional money, something she admitted to my husband who works in her office. So, I feel that all doctors probably think the same way. So, I could be worrying about an issue because my doctor, who already gets paid very well, wanted more money.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he hasn't really given me a reason not to. He's very receptive to what I think is wrong with me and is very thorough in explaining what I am suffering from. He also explains his choices as to how to treat and explains why my initial thought of my reason for coming is wrong without being condescending.
0.800000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. She hasn't let me down and I don't feel like I'm not getting the care I go in for.
0.600000	It is not that I do not trust my primary care physician, it's just that I am not sure he is giving me the best information or just the information he gives to everyone.
0.880000	"I trust my primary care physician. He is always available via the electronic portal and will respond to me within hours, sometimes even on the weekend. Sometimes an initial treatment plan won't work, but he is always ready with ""plan B"". He also makes sure I'm on schedule with preventative care (physicals, etc.)"
0.800000	I just generally trust the profession.  I believe that almost all doctors are primarily concerned with the well being and proper treatment of their patients.  There may be exceptions to that general rule but there would have to be irrefutable evidence to that effect to make me doubt the sincerity if not the competence of any physician.
0.760000	I have been under this doctor's care for over 10 years.  He inherited me as a patient from my previous physician, who retired. I was one of his first patients and we have become friends.  I have learned to trust him, and have never found his diagnostic instincts to be in error.  He knows when to treat me for a problem, and when to leave me alone.  He is a kind human being and a good physician.
0.800000	I had a primary care physician that I liked and trusted very much. She had me do a number of tests when I first saw her so she could see what was going on. She is always listened and answered all questions I had, she had a caring personality, non-judgy. Sadly she moved and I am currently looking for a new primary care physician. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctors because he has always been straight with me. He listens to me and answers all of my questions. If he doesn't know he finds out and tells me later.
0.720000	I trust my physician to a degree.  However, she tends to send me out to specialists a lot...which makes me wonder how much she is really able to treat.  If I have a cough, sniffle or fever, she's fine.  If it goes beyond that....hmmmmm.
0.440000	"I often feel like doctors care more about their time and money that the patient. It can be difficult to talk in depth about medical problems because my doctor is looking for a ""quick fix"" rather than a long term solution."
0.840000	I trust my doctor. He tells me whats going on in a straight forward manner. He explains anything I do not understand and answers any other questions that I may have.
0.440000	I distrust my PCP because doctor's today have to think first about appeasing insurance providers and covered procedures in a health insurance policy as opposed to what is best for the patient. As a result of this I don't think my Doctor's word can be trusted.
0.720000	I have a doctor that will really listen to me and will sit an evaluate my situation and symptoms with me while explaining everything.  She is great at making me feel like she really cares and tries so hard to do what's best for me and figure out the best treatment plan for me. 
0.760000	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician. I believe that they are the most capable person to diagnose and treat my medical conditions and that they have my best interests in mind.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physicians because we have a mutual trust of respect and friendliness. I find that if I empathize with them and ask then questions in a friendly manner, they are always eager to listen and advise me best on how to proceed.
0.680000	There have been times where I don't think he payed full attention to what I explained to him, then had me do tests that were incomplete only to redo them again the next time when they failed to find anything. This ties in with my belief that he is rushed and therefore I feel rushed as well.
0.880000	My doctor always tells me their opinion and their level of confidence. They give me options if they are available.
0.920000	My primary care physician has been honest and helpful in my decisions regarding my health.  Even though my last blood work showed I was nearing a diabetic level, I was very concerned that she wanted to put me on Metformin.  I chose not to add this medicine into my body and wanted to change my diet instead.  She approved my decision and suggested that we re-do the blood work in 3 months.  I am getting ready to make my 3 month appointment for Monday.
0.720000	I have been going a long time and always get the help I need. My doctor goes over options with me and takes the time to explain things.
0.760000	My doctor is very thorough and I am pretty confident in her abilities as a doctor. I have gone to her for many different ailments I have had and she has always prescribed or ordered the right tests for me.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I believe he cares.   He seems down to earth and he showed concern when he saw I had too high amounts of cholesterol in my blood.   Also he seems to provide good advice that has helped me in the past. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because would have built a relationship over many years. I have come to trust them and their decisions regarding my healthcare. I always consult them in health related matters. 
0.720000	I feel doctors are too drug orientated and therefore I tend to distrust their judgement if it does not include alternative or natural treatments. As I have experienced a lot of success in treating my own health issues naturally without drugs I tend to refuse any advice from a doctor that relies heavily on drugs.
0.520000	I feel like sometimes he's in a rush and just wants to move on to the next patient.  He addresses issues but I don't feel like he's being thorough and thinking through his answers.
0.800000	My doctor is willing to listen and doesn't ignore my concerns. She brings up different options and will let me choose which of them I think would work best for my situation. Overall, I'm very happy with my PCP.
0.720000	I do not have a primary care physician anymore so I will just go with my neurologist.When I started going to her I was on all the wrong medicines all of my Drs before her were just throwing pills at me hoping for the best, I was even on a medication that was so outdated they only prescribed for cases where nothing else would work. She changed all of that in just one visit by putting me on all new medication. She even took care of my constant headaches and other little issues that I thought where just there for life.
0.720000	My doctor is very thorough, when he makes a diagnosis he will tell you why and why not it is or isnt and what treatment he thinks will work,  He is very open about his opinions and ideas, and if something doesnt work he will quickly try a different treatment or diagnosis. Wether its something I want to hear or not, he will tell me, and provide his best opinion on how to cope with it.
0.840000	My doctor has made efforts to connect with other doctors treating me for various issues, and she spends as much time as necessary with me during appointments.
0.800000	Before she retired, I had a good relationship with my former primary care.  She was very open with me and worked with me to better my help.  I really trusted her.  Now she is gone and I'm back at square one with no one I trust.
1.000000	I completely trust m doctor! She is very kind and compassionate. She always takes the time to listen to my concerns carefully. She will in turn offer her professional advice to me. She even stays around to have a few minutes of small talk when we are finished. She's absolutely great! 
0.680000	My primary care physician asks questions that implies they're trying to dig deeper into my symptoms to see what is wrong. They run tests that may help figure out what's wrong with me.
0.400000	"I have gone to see my doctor about trouble i am having that had nothing to do with my weight, however he will always tell me something about ""loosing weight will make you feel better"" or connect everything to my weight. I already know loosing weight will make me feel better, i have lost 81 pounds and feel alot better, but can you please just help me with the problem i actually came in for! Speaking of loosing weight, he has tried several times to convince me that i should change my diet from eating moderate protein and high fat, to something that includes more vegetables. Meanwhile when i was a vegetarian i was still pre diabetic and overweight, but now that i only eat meat i am no longer a risk for getting diabetes, as a doctor i would think he would be convinced by that proof, but he still tries to convince me i am wrig and tries to get me to take meds i don't think i need."
0.360000	Doctors are nothing more than amateur golfers who are also sales reps for pharmaceutical companies. They could care less about patient care and well being. They are only interested in getting you on prescription medications and having you come in to their office as often as possible while doing nothing beyond billing you and your insurance companies.
0.680000	I think that doctors in general have my best interests in mind when I see them for a problem that I am having. But the trouble with healthcare is that it is a for profit entity and the cost and profit side of it always comes into play.
0.760000	My primary care physician shows a genuine interest in me. She shows that she cares about health, calories, weight and healthy food. I trust her.
0.880000	I have only seen my doctor a few times since we moved to Kentucky but she seems to be very upfront and honest about things.  She also has to be just about one of the kindest people that I have met since moving here.  
1.000000	My doctor always has my best interest at heart. He will listen to my concerns and do what we both feel necessary to help the situation. My doctor will explain the pros and cons with me and together help me decide my best option.
0.920000	I have no reason to distrust doctors and I'm fairly confident that if my doctor did not have my best interests, and the best interests of all his patients in mind, he would not have chosen to be a doctor.
0.400000	My primary physician seems hurried to prescribe antibiotics over anything, and she does not like writing referrals to specialists or running tests, like the flu.  In the past Ive had to insist on seeing a specialist.
0.560000	All in all, I feel doctors have good intentions and generally want to help you. I don't have a primary care physician, so I can't tell you anything about that sort of relationship.
0.840000	My doctor has always fully explained things to me in a nice way. He's never belittled me or made me feel unintelligent. He's fun, thorough and thoughtful. I would recommend him to anyone. 
0.920000	I trust my doctor's decisions because my doctors are trained professionals and they know what they are doing. My doctor is super nice and kind and takes time with me when I don't understand something about my health or my wellbeing. My doctor is irreplaceable to me.
0.600000	My doctor understands my pain an what I need she talks to me for hours an dose her job right I believe in are 100%
0.520000	My current primary care physician is only concerned about getting my appointments over with. I don't have time to talk about issues with her and doesn't inform me about my health. I'm searching for a new physician because I do not have trust in my current one.
0.880000	My good health is a reflection upon my provider, if I'm doing well, then so are they. They have never given me a reason to doubt that they have my best interest at heart.
0.720000	I have not had a negative experience thus far. They seem to be concerned with giving me the necessary information, however, there have been occasions where they seem rushed.
0.840000	My doctor always gives it to me straight. He doesn't dance around or mince words.  I trust him for that. He's always open and gives options and opinions about the options. O respect him for that. 
0.760000	My GP listens to me and trusts my intelligence. He knows I don't like to take medication unnecessary medications and that I only call if something is very wrong. He's an amazing diagnostician. 
0.680000	Everyone makes mistakes and often there are multiple treatment options for a given condition.  So, while I do feel that I can trust my Doctor I don't rely on them completely without understanding the full situation.  I like to ask them what they would do, or if their loved one had the same issue what would be the top two treatments they would recommend.
0.480000	Itâs not that I feel that doctors are intentionally wrong or misleading. In most cases Iâm sure they arenât. But medicine in general is so nuanced that Iâve found when I visit a dr for something I gain little to no actual help or improvements and often just end up trying their advice to little help. I feel like Iâm playing dr roulette every visit. Usually I just end up with a bill and no new help or information and often also have to get referred to another dr cause drâs are so specialized nowadays that you canât just visit one dr for most things. So that just increases my bills, wares my time and creates stress. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor as much as possible while realizing she is human and makes mistakes. My doctor asks open-ended questions and allows me to express my concerns openly.  She talks to me about different options I have regarding treatment.  I never feel like she is rushed or in a hurry to get to her next patient. 
0.960000	I've been seeing my current primary care physician for 5 years now. I've had Type 2 Diabetes follow-ups regularly every 3 months for that period of time. The staff in his doctor's office are always very nice, kind, and polite. They're efficient, knowledgeable, and patient. My primary care physician himself is very knowledgeable on just about any condition you may bring up to him. He's always been honest about my health, suggested non-medical ways to address said problem, suggested medical ways to address said problem if non-medical wasn't enough or not appropriate for me personally, and been personable in a professional way. 
0.640000	You never really know when to trust doctors... There's the whole profit motive thing these days. A lot of them are basically drug pushers for big pharma.
0.960000	I trust my PCP because I work with them and for them on a daily basis and i know that thehy care about each and everyone of their patietnts. I trust them to give me the right options and recommendations about my care.
0.560000	I trust my doctor because I have no one else I can trust. I live a lonely life. I know that he is one of the only people that I interact with daily who does not wish to inflict some sort of harm (bodily or otherwise) on me. Doctor client privilege also makes me feel very safe with the medical staff that assist me at the hospital, so I know that anything i say can be documented in complete confidence. 
0.680000	"i believed all doctors Truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard.[1] Truth may also often be used in modern contexts to refer to an idea of ""truth to self,"" or authenticity. Truth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, and religion"
0.800000	All doctors to me should be trusted until they've done something wrong. They wouldn't be in their position if they weren't given trust to start. I'm not saying ALL should be trusted, but all should be given a fair chance!
0.760000	I trust my Primary Care Dr because I have been his patient for 25+ years and he knows me well. While I have never had to disagree with procedures or meds that he prescribes, I believe that if I were to be diagnosed with cancer, he and I may not agree on a treatment. Overall I do not trust most Drs. because of the government involvement and influence on things like prescrition drugs, chemo and their motives for prescribing many things.
0.480000	I don't like it when I go to the doctor and they can't find out what is wrong with me so they just contribute it to something else without getting down to what is causing my problems. I always thought that the doctors were there to look into things and find a cause and help to make it better, but now it seems they are only here to collect big paychecks whether they help a person or not.
0.720000	It really does seem like my doctor does care about me at times and it is really nice knowing that. Everytime i go in he askes how am i feeling.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because i have been dealing with them for a while and they showed and prove to me that if i just eat differently and exercise a little more i can lose weight and become healthy and i did.
0.560000	Overall I don't feel alot of trust of doctors in general. The reason why I feel this way is because I feel most doctor's are in it for the money and they don't necessarily want people to be healed. They give you medicine for almost everything and that is not a good thing. So overall I don't trust in doctors and don't go to the doctors unless I have no other choice.
0.520000	I haven't gone to this new doctor as much and it takes time to build up trust and believing in the professional. Too many doctors get bought out by pharmaceutical companies and leave out some other medications that could help you if need be. I am not all conspiracy gung ho but I need time to build trust
0.280000	I feel like most mainstream doctors are in trained to only treat symptoms and not cure and heal the body as a whole. Big Pharma is a huge business and many of those doctors get incentives for keeping people coming in. Holistic doctors would be concerned with treating and curing ( and maybe  few doctors).
0.960000	I trust my ankle surgeon because he actually screwed up a surgery.  It was not something he did as much as my body reacted poorly to the procedure.  He went step by step with me as to how to fix the problem and what lingering issues I would have.  He is always up front and direct but polite with me. 
0.800000	I have gone to him for several years.  He tells it like it is, and doesn't sugar coat it.  When I have concerns I bring them to his attention and he discusses it with me.  I'm an overall healthy person, and see him twice per.  If I am in there outside of the every six months, he knows something is really wrong.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because she seems genuinely interested in my concerns when I ask questions. When there is something I need to do, she gives me options that are based in real, conventional medicine and doesn't try to brush me off by suggesting placebo-like alternative treatments. She seems cautious and checks my lab results, and will take some time to see if my concern is based on an injury or illness during an exam. If something seems like it will clear up on its own, like some pains, she will suggest contacting her office if it doesn't get better in a certain number of days or weeks. I like her style of care and her advice is almost always a good way forward.
0.560000	My doctor over the years I have lost trust in him he used to be throughout and take his time with me and discuss issues but now when I go I have to wait an hour and a half for him to be in the room for not even 2 minutes which really upsets me because I have to drive 75 miles each way to get to my appointment.
0.600000	The pay cash to see my doctor.  I honestly believe he is running the clinic he has for the money.  I do believe he understands the way I feel about my condition because he's experienced the same problems I have, yet I still think he is more worried about money than he is the actual welfare of his patients and their recoveries.
0.760000	:I trust my primary care physician because for the most part, they have always given me reliable information. They seem to be very knowledgeable about the conditions I am facing and experienced with those conditions. The take their time in delivering the best care possible to me.
0.840000	I generally trust the doctors that I see because I respect their knowledge and experience. This is particularly true when I see specialists about a particular condition. I have faith when seeing a specialist that they have seen many patients with my condition and that they will be able to quickly find a cure or method to manage the condition. I also try to use this opportunity to ask general questions about the condition to them, which I believe is more informative than if I searched online on my own.
0.600000	I feel very neutral about my trust towards my primary car physician. I can not whole heartedly put all my faith into them. That why I strive to get second opinions if something does go wrong. I go see a specialist in order to better understand, and make sure I am not being misdiagnosed. There have been instances when I do not believe my doctor has made the right decision such as not prescribing the right dosage of a medication, and I have struggled to come to terms with that. Until then I still go cause its a convenient location, and accepts my insurance.
0.360000	I don't like how Dr.s get kick backs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe meds. This makes me not trust them because they put themselves first.
0.720000	She's a professional, she seems to be pretty knowledgeable and she seems really caring.  I just kind of assume that most doctors know what they are doing, so I do not see why my doctor would be any different.
0.760000	For the most I trust my physician. I do think that doctors need to spend more time with there patients. 
0.680000	I trust that they care about the patients. They seem to want what is best for us and provide all the options. There are more effective doctors out there though I'm sure. They can still be wrong, or overlook something, especially if they are overworked.
0.520000	I sometimes trust them because they give good solutions, and sometimes I never get the right cure. Also some doctors tend to be very well behavied and this gives me some more trust because they judge the case as if this is their case.
0.840000	My doctor has been my PCP for years and I trust him. I don't get sick often, but when I do he hits the nail on the head with the diagnosis. He listens and I feel he truly cares about my well being
0.600000	I trust my primary physician to an extent. I feel that my physician is too busy to really give me a thorough exam and is super quick to keep moving. I feel that there is no way there can always be a right diagnosis
0.960000	I do not feel that my doctor has ever lied to or withheld information from me so I have no reason to distrust her. She answers all of the questions that I do remember to ask her and her answers always sound reasonable.
0.800000	Mainly because I do not really need my doctor to explain to me what is going on. I can see that he gives instructions and recommendation based on current research and best practices by verifying it for myself. Unless you do this you allow yourself to be treated like an object instead of a sentient being. It is vital that a person educate him/herself outside of the doctor's office.
0.800000	I generally trust skilled professionals across the board. I assume someone who was intelligent and hardworking enough to fulfill the obligations of becoming a practicing physician would uphold the integrity of the position.
1.000000	I trust him because he listens to what is going on and if he can't figure something out, he will direct me to someone who will and will provide a referral with no problem.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she explains everything in detail. She gives me time to process and makes sure that I understand the severity of a health issue. She also gives me time to ask any questions that I might have and is patient with me as she answers my questions. She is comforting and a great person. All these qualities make me trust her and feel comfortable when being seen by her. When I have questions outside of the doctors office I am able to call her during her work time and she will answer my questions. She is the definition of a great and caring doctor.
0.760000	"I trust my primary care physician for the following reasons: She is always attentive and shows interest in my line of questioning when it comes to description of symptoms, inquiries with regards to preventative maintenance (i.e. discussing future concerns based on age, family history as it relates to my current health, etc.). I never feel rushed during a routine visit when it comes to discussing concerns and overall health strategies. Overall, I feel that she cares about my well-being. My main distrust point with my primary care physician is the ""physical"" side of routine examinations. I feel like she is less comprehensive during the exam than my prior physician with regards to tests and covering all aspects of the exam. This is an additional concern now that I am older and more susceptible to common problems (e.g. enlarged prostate, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)."
1.000000	My doctor knows that I will seek outside information about any conditions that he may be treating to make sure that I am informed. Therefore, he is thorough in his explanations and makes sure that I have the pros and cons before I make a decision.
0.360000	I think most doctors do what they think is right and its not always up to date. I live in a rural community so they don't always stay current.
0.760000	My physician is not perfect, but nobody is. Despite this limitation, I can trust him to competently assess my situation and recommend appropriate actions. My doctor respects my intellect and will discuss the medical situation with me so that I understand and buy into treatment options. Although he is trained in standard care protocols, which are short-sighted remedy-based approaches, I can evaluate the alternative options myself and competently discuss them with my physician. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for several years. He has proven over time that he wants to keep me healthy. He has never diagnosed me incorrectly so I have no reason to believe he is lazy or incompetent. 
0.800000	My doctor makes sure to let me know what is going on if there is anything going on and makes sure I understand everything they do as they do it. My doctor makes sure that my thought are heard when I have a questions or comment and makes sure that they understand ever question I have. 
0.960000	I feel that I can completely trust my doctor.  SHe listens to me when I talk and she helps me to feel at ease.  I believe that she has my best interest in mind.  SHe genuinely cares about me.
0.800000	I have been knowing him for a long time.  I know how he works.  He has good online reviews.  He is a good listener.
0.800000	My doctor is a caring person. My my doctor is very good at getting to the bottom of what is going on. I trust my doctor.
0.600000	some doctors are just wrong with the diagnosis and treatment.  Some treatments are very difficult to accomplish by me.  Some doctors just order them and don't give a thought as to how hard it is on the client
0.480000	I don't feel as though my doctor knows me or cares that much about my well being in particular. I think he sees me just as any other patient. I think that can become dangerous because then the doctor applies a one size fits all type mentality. 
0.800000	My doctor is caring and shows genuine concern for my well being.  She is thorough and answers any questions that I may have.  She takes her time and is very good at what she does. 
0.480000	Some medical decisions are not 100% safe. And I prefer to do all natural remedies first before having to pump toxins in my body that can cause more harm than good. They have some good options but half the time without tests, they are guessing. 
0.920000	I always make sure the doctor I am dealing with is trustworthy. They usually have rules in place to make sure I am getting a fair deal, and if not, I can always find someone else or complain about them to the office/hospital. I have never had a bad experience at the doctor's office, and I can tell by their personality that they are taking care of me and have me in their best interests.
0.840000	I think sometimes doctors focus too much on pharmaceutical prescriptions to mask problems when it would be wiser to get to the underlying problem. In general, though, their solutions to help and can help someone who is getting or is sick.
0.560000	I feel that they usually know what they are doing but you can't expect them to care deeply about you because they see so many people that can't care about each one a great deal. Doctors work long hours and make mistakes because they are human so you need to watch what they do and say carefully to as a mistake they make can cause a good deal of harm to you or possibly death. Doctors are also going to lie from time to time as again they are human., in my experience doctors also have an over inflated ego which can cause problems as they are less likely to second guess their decisions.
0.600000	While I believe doctors are a trustworthy lot, in general, I am also aware that doctors see many patients per day and treatment options are constantly changing. Doctors may not be fully aware of the latest developments in medicine. Recently published studies showing adverse reactions to conventional treatments may not be foremost in a doctors mind while treating her patients.
0.840000	I trust doctors because they seem very open to discuss questions and concerns. Even to the point of not wanting to take prescribed medicine they will refer to other alternatives. 
0.920000	My primary physician is a friend who I have known since he was in medical school. He researches constantly and was top of his class for good reason. He knows my health history and respects my personal wants regarding medical care. He also takes time to listen to patients, not just myself, and is always willing to do extra work if need be. 
0.800000	There are instances or maybe rare instances that I did not trust my doctor one time because all he/she ever gave me was simple remedy that I could have just researched in the internet.
0.800000	i had a few good doc in my life they were was honest about my diansoses.helped in any way they could.understood my phobias oh i forgot to menction i have anemia too.
0.200000	"For one, I don't have insurance and live well below the poverty level, so I don't have a PCP. Medical care is in an emergency only. But, when I did have a PCP and insurance, my doctors were in the room for 5 minutes or less and just gave a dx as whatever was the fastest and most convenient thing at the time. Also, I have a mental health history, so anything they couldn't explain or dx, they just attributed to me being ""mentally unstable""."
0.680000	I've been through many doctors and can understand that some are to be trusted less since they may diagnose you with something that nets them alot of money if you dont understand your own issue. Sometimes you may be a test subject for a new disease that makes alot of money for them and you have to go through a lot of bullshit just because you dont know whats wrong. I trust my primary care physician quite a bit since its more of a help me help you situation, but generally they're still a second opinion.
1.000000	I trust my medical staff to tell me what is wrong or right. They take the time to explain the information to me and ask me if I have any questions.
0.520000	I don't think my doctor has 'bad intentions' towards me or any of the other patients in general, but I do think that It's just a job to him. In a hurry to get to lunch, and in a hurry to get on with his day like anyone else when they work that much.
0.800000	I trust my physician because my friend and my friends mom were her patients. They went to a school i am familiar with . They have always explain everything and provided care for me. 
0.960000	My doctor listens to my concerns without trying to push certain medications or treatment when do not benefit me in the long run.
0.720000	My primary care doctor seems to take care in doing all the necessary testing for illness and other conditions which might be present is a person of my age, gender and lifestyle.
0.920000	I know that my doctor wants to do all he can to make me well.  He gives me options for natural medicine and regular medicine. I know he is a Christian and that also makes me feel better about my care.
0.600000	I currently don't have a PCP and haven't even gone to a doctor in over 3 years. I do have problems with depression and anxiety and was being seen at a mental health clinic up until about 6 months ago when they refused to re-new my medications because I was unable to pay the copays that I owed them.
0.840000	I have been with the same doctor through every health issue and this doctor has always listened and understood everything along the way. I could talk to him about anything.
0.840000	Physicians spend years and years honing their craft, learning their skills, and making rational decisions about what to do in any given medical scenario. I don't feel that it's my place to question their advice, so generally they know what the best course of action is. I have full trust in what my care provider tells me I should do.
0.880000	She is always there for me. She lets me know important information about my health. She answers all my questions with patience.
0.600000	I think doctors are packing too many patients into a day. It leaves them without the time or inclination to look too deeply into patients' medical issues. 
0.800000	I think sometimes Physicians are in a hurry. So it is to their advantage to gloss over your case. So instead of carefully considering your case they just take care of the obvious and move on to the next patient.
0.880000	I have known my physician for a very long time. He was my family doctor for my entire life. He has always had good solutions to all of my problems. He has never failed my family in any aspect. 
1.000000	My doctor has never steered me wrong before when I've come in with any issues, and he has always seemed very genuine, understanding, and honest. He always makes sure I understand everything and makes sure I know I can always follow up with him about anything if ever necessary. 
0.480000	I have self diagnosed before I go to the dr. and had to push for the dr to ask for a test . That was contrary to his diagnosis. He then did the test and I was  correct. It was very frustrating !
0.800000	About 12 years ago I had major heart surgery due to life threatening conditions.  I have had chronic conditions since, and my care requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.  My doctor saved my life then, and my care has continued to be thorough and effective.  I have never been dissatisfied in the least with any outcomes from my doctor or provider.
0.480000	I do not trust many doctors in general which is why I don't go to the doctor very often. I believe that many doctors are just sellers of drugs and make way too much money in royalties for talking people in to taking certain drugs.
0.600000	I feel like doctors are usually in a rush to see as many patients as possible and just throw out the most broad diagnosis and treatment that they can hoping it will solve the problem. I feel like if something is more complicated to diagnose, it will take a long process of narrowing down if they ever even get it right
0.800000	My doctor is open, funny, and easy to approach.  I enjoy my doctor and don't feel nervous asking my doctor questions pertaining to my health.
0.800000	He listens to what I say and asks questions to clarify. He remembers from visit to visit small details about my health issues. He does additional research when needed.
0.720000	My doctor has gone to great lengths to help me. I am always confident that they know what they are doing or are at least trying to help. This is why I keep going to them.
0.720000	I trust the doctor because that is his job.  I have never been given any indication that he was unable to perform his duties.  I would hope that I would be given the same courtesy.
0.680000	It is natural for people to try and get as much money as possible. This applies to doctors because certain procedures that might be unnecessary are sometimes ordered so that the doctor can bill you or your insurance more than he typically could. I have good insurance so I do not mind having extra tests performed because it is not costing me anything and i am getting thorough examinations 
0.760000	I generally trust my primary care physician.  Sometimes, there are things he does that's unclear at first but he's usual thorough in terms of explaining things. 
0.640000	I occasionally feel rushed when interacting with doctors. Although I know they make an effort to be efficient with their time, I sometimes feel as if they are sacrificing quality for efficiency.
0.200000	I distrust physicians in general. I believe that they are strongly misinformed and guided by big pharma. They are told to prescribe things and they don't do their own research.They just take what the pharma representative says as fact. 
0.880000	I trust my physician because she takes the time to explain potential problems and my own research has given me no reason to distrust her information.
0.560000	I feel like my doctor is quick to recommend pharmaceutical drugs for everything I have and go through. I don't like this approach, I like to do things naturally so when he suggests things, I lose a little trust. I also feel like this is generally all doctors. I think they get kickbacks for the medications they prescribe, so it makes me much less trusting of their motives.
0.520000	I trust a doctor's medical knowledge but not a doctor's character or infallibility. A doctor can make mistakes even if they try their best, they can have beliefs that influence their medical advice, they can be influenced by prejudices or incentives. Doctors are only human. But that doesn't mean I should ignore what they say.
0.920000	Overall, I trust in my doctor because of her confidence and demeanor. She has always been extremely kind, full of information, and has let me know of alternatives if there are any. A primary example was when she prescribed me anti depression medication last year. They worked well, and she made me feel confident that they would help with my situation. 
1.000000	My doctor has seen me for several years. I trust them a lot because of the rapport we have built. My doctor has always given me great advice about my health, and has inquired about my life and goals. I think my doctor always tries his best with me. 
0.800000	I have had good reviews from other patients who are my friends, and longtime patients of my doctor. He has never made me felt rushed and answered all my questions to my satisfaction.
0.560000	I think Doctors can get in the habit of following the same treatment plan over and over. Each person is different and should have their treatment tailored to them. 
0.720000	My last Primary care physician was a confident man that could answer my questions and was very receptive to any suggestions or bringing up other forms of care. 
0.680000	I trust my doctors in general because they have much more experience than I do and would imagine that would lead them to make or suggest the right options for me in regards to my health.
0.600000	I think in medicine, having some room for reservations is good, and second opinions are good as well. I think after taking classes with some of the next generations med students...makes me question them as well. They are people just like me. 
0.600000	I trust my doctors to a point. I do not trust them completely and feel they sometimes choice the easier way than the way that might be more beneficial to me. 
0.680000	I have always had good interaction with my primary care physician and feel like i can trust them with all of medical needs.  This person does not judge me and gives advice for all things that i come to them with.  I have never had a reason not to trust this person. 
0.480000	I do not believe that he spends enough time with me to really get to know me. He has given me drugs which help a little, but never asked me in depth about my chronic pain or fatigue, nor has he referred me to a specialist who could.
0.680000	I like that my primary care physician usually presents me with multiple courses of action to take for different problems (i.e. different medications).  However, it comes across as being a little indecisive sometimes when I'd rather have a straight yes or no kind of answer.  He also is quick to recommend a specialist instead of giving a medical opinion himself. Overall I think he is trustworthy, though maybe overly cautious.
0.800000	The particular doctor I currently have takes her time during visits. She asks questions about my life, my family, and the current condition I'm experiencing. I've told my wife I believe my doctor sees me as a project, her goal is to keep me heathy and strong. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician. Because he went to school to gain knowledge to help people and I truly believe he trys to do what he thinks is the best to help me and learn what will be the best to help other people as well sometimes doctors have to try different approaches to get the best outcome that will help each individual overall. 
0.400000	Physicians in this day and age are governed by insurance companies and regulations more than medicine and science.  They don't always willingly do these things, but nonetheless they have to bow down to these entities in order to get paid by using less effective treatments first, or substitute treatments for others due to money.  Also, a lot more time is spent on documentation than actually giving the patient good eye contact and favorable bed side manner along with taking as much time as is needed with patients.
0.720000	I don't distrust the doctor. I merely feel like so many tests and procedures are unnecessary and sometimes harmful. I don't go to the doctor unless I feel like something is wrong.
0.600000	I do not have complete trust in my physician because sometimes they are just out for money and do not tell you everything.  They try to push medications and not everything requires prescription medicine.
0.840000	I trust my physician because she has always been honest with me and straight forward. She always tells me things even if it isn't exactly what I want to hear 
0.720000	The doctor that I have now is pretty good. He seems honest and decent. So I do trust him a good bit. Don't feel this way about all doctors but this one is pretty good.
0.760000	Since I feel good and get cured after a doctors visit i feel like the doctor is helping me to stay healthy.
0.960000	My doctor is a very good doctor, who i trust completely. I have been seeing her for the past 4 year. I feel that she always tells me the truth and looks out for my bet interest. Anytime that i feel something is wrong she always listens to me and doesnt blow me off. There has been times when she has made appointments for me for follow ups, within like a week. I have not had others doctors do that
0.760000	My primary care physician has known me for a couple years now and I have grown to trust in him lot. He is good at explaining things to me for the most part and is very easy going. He is also very thorough in explaining things to me and trying to see what I think about certain health issues. He has not let me down yet and has not given me a reason to distrust him.
0.880000	My doctor is a DO, so I already feel that the philosophical underpinnings of his education are more patient focused than illness focused. He listens carefully to what I tell him, and responds point by point to my statements. He trusts in my personal medical judgement as far as my chronic conditions.
1.000000	I trust my doctor wholeheartedly.  He is very concerned about my well being and has been very thorough in helping me solve my problems. He isn't afraid to deal with my insurance company head on to get me the best care.  He hasn't let me down in the past and won't do it in the future.  
0.480000	I go to my university health center currently, where I feel the credentials to be a medical professional are slightly more lax compared to a pediatrician you may go to as an adolescent or child. In my opinion the structured, budget friendly operation of a university health center is caked with many professionals screening and treating students the same for the most part. While I can rely on them for blood work, sexually transmitted disease screening, general prescriptions, and counseling services I would not go to them for diagnosis or anything major. I personally would prefer a resident at a hospital to the nurses I usually see. At some colleges it is worse than mine, some only have nurses and no licensed doctors. As such I don't really trust my doctor, but it's not awful.
0.720000	I have been working with him for over 10 years so I feel like he knows me extremely well.  He understands the health conditions I have and how the impact me.
0.880000	I feel I can trust my primary care physician because he has shown me that the decisions he helps me make about my health are the ones that are best for me. My doctor is also very clear about the decisions he makes.
0.960000	I have none my doctor for more than 10 years. He has treated me since I was a teenager. He has always putting my needs first. There has never been a time when I've questioned his decision.
0.520000	I don't have a doctor, or see one regularly, I only go when I have a problem. So I'm just not going to trust some random doctor I've never met before, especially when my money is on the line.
0.960000	I really do trust my physician because of his bedside manner, his eye contact, his willingness to answer questions, the way he makes the encounter feel professional but personal. He always greets me when he enters the room, asks me how I've been, reviews the previous visits with me, asks if there have been any new updates or changes, if I've been sick lately. The tone he sets for the entire encounter is always very positive. He makes me feel like it's not just about a paycheck or a routine of his daily life. He asks me if I have any questions. If I do have questions, he's always willing and able to answer me honestly and completely. Sometimes he offers up information on natural remedies that usually have no drawbacks. His attitude is always bright and positive and I never have to dread going in for a checkup or appointment for a new issue. I also know he won't speak of it outside of the appointment. He has my confidence.
0.800000	My primary care physician was extremely amiable. Even if we were not dealing with something that was quite within the realm of his expertise (such as my anxiety) he would recommend literature I could read on the subject.  He would never fail to ask follow-up questions about things I'd experienced in a previous appointment with him. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has decades of experience in conventional medicine, and also has obtained extra courses lately in naturopathy. He is very knowledgable about medical conditions and how to treat them both conventionally or alternatively with herbs, homeopathy etc. He always looks me in the eye and listens. 
0.800000	I feel like the doctor-patient relationship is built entirely on trust and so my basic foundation is totally trusting him. He's never given me any reason to doubt him.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with her for a long time. She remembers my name and is always very polite and seems generally concerned for me when I show up. Any questions that I asked are answered whole-heartedly and it feels she cares about me instead of just trying to get a bunch of my money through unneeded things.
1.000000	i've been going to my doctor for years and he knows me very well. he gives all options. if i want to do something like try a new medication he'll give me all the pros and cons and also give me other(better) options. he's never dimissive
0.800000	I trust them because they seem ethical.  You lknow that feeling that you get when yoj talk to someone that means that you can just trust them?  I fet that feeling from her when I talk to her.  She's really smart and into you quite a bit when you talk with her.  Id recommend her to anyone looking for a doctor in their near future for sure!
0.480000	I try to avoid going to my doctor unless it's absolutely necessary.  I don't trust them because I have anxiety and depression and it makes trust almost impossible for me.  I realize that this is all on me but I just find it not possible for me.  I would like very much to do it.  I know they're not going to lie to me but I still find that I just don't trust any of them.
0.920000	They are always very thorough in explaining what the possibilities are for treatment. They are always so careful in explaining the pros and cons of each treatment in a way that I can weigh them more easily.
0.960000	My doctor has always been kind to me. She answers all my questions and listens to my concerns. She gives me different options and helps me decide which is best for me.
1.000000	I see my PCP every 60 to 90 days for migraines. He will listen to my every need or issue. Often I may have something else nagging me (back pain, neck pain) and no matter what he will address these issues and guide me in the right direction. 
0.400000	"I see my PCP once a month and in any given 12 month period he may take my BP or listen to my heart 1 or 2 times in those 12 months.  He does not generally ask how I am doing or feeling only comes in, sits down in front of the computer and asks ""what do you need today"" referring to Rx refills.  He is not a hands on doctor and If I should ask or complain about a problem he dismisses it and says we are all getting older."
0.720000	My doctor is thorough, but he can't know everything. I can't totally trust him or any doctor, knowing that they may not be able to find the answer. 
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician fully because he is a very good doctor. I have been seeing him since I was a child and he has always given me the best care and been right about his diagnosis on the first try. He is nice and good at communication and making sure I fully understand everything and am comfortable
0.960000	I have had the same doctor for 30 years and he is like an extended family member, I feel he cares for me and will always suggest what he feels is the best treatment for me, he is very professional with an excellent bedside manner.
0.760000	I have been going to the same Doctor since I was a child, they care but they also don't make any money off me if I'm dead
0.680000	I am a very critical person. So I am always looking for more information than what is given. It has nothing to do with my doctor being a bad doctor, and more with my inquisitive disposition. 
0.800000	My doctor always answers all of my questions and has never steered my wrong. I'm never rushed and am always number one when I'm in the room with her. 
0.640000	Sometimes it seems that they're too quick to recommend invasive treatments like drugs with bad side effects or surgery rather than trying to get the body to heal itself, which seems much safer (and less expensive) to me.
0.520000	I like my doctor, but his clinic is so busy that I sometimes get the feeling that he goes with the easiest explanation of something. It makes me willing to spend a bit more money to go to a clinic that I know isn't busy if needed.
0.200000	I don't care for my doctor much. I hadn't been to a doctor in 10 years. Before that I had a bad experience with my doctor. Recently I've also had a bad experience. Just more medical bills for them to prescribe me crap. Basically a 100 version of a drug that I could get for $1 over the counter,.
0.480000	"I don't have a primary care physician. I don't go to doctors much and have had mixed results. Different doctors have told me that strep is nothing to worry about and others have been ""upset"" that I didn't come in sooner. "
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because he has a lot of experience in the medical field.  He serves as a mentor and teacher in the medical community and seems to be an expert in his field.  
0.400000	Because I have a lot of experience in care physicians giving me the wrong treatment, tests, and medications.  I have suffered a lot of negative side effects because of doctors not believing me. Doctors in my are do not have the knowledge to help me how I need to be helped. They are not willing to individualize their treatments according to individuality and differences. This made me skeptical over a lot of doctors.
0.960000	I do not really have much distrust in the my primary care physician. I feel like he does a great job in being honest and transparent.
0.680000	I have never known him to lie about anything but sometimes I don't think another drug is the answer for everything, I like natural approaches to as many things as possible.
1.000000	I've had my doctor for a long time. She always listens when i want to talk and has given me excellent advice in the past.
0.800000	I have had my PC for 15 years now. We have a relationship that is based on trust and friendship and he is always there to discuss any problems I have. He is an excellent doctor and has a great manner with patients.
0.960000	I have been working with my primary care doctor for several years. She has a personal connection to another organization that I work with, and a similar background to my own. She has gone out of her way to build trust and extend sincere personal insight.
1.000000	My doctor is completely honest with me whenever I had an appointment. He tells me exactly what is wrong and the possibles outcomes of it, as well as the aproaches I can take.
0.440000	My PCP just seems to have a diagnosis ready to go before we even speak. He rarely seems to be concerned with side effects I report and love to have tests run. His focus just seems very narrow, he is late and just dismissive. 
0.440000	My doctor is usually backed up and busy and I usually feel rushed and that he is just trying to get to the next patient
0.800000	I only see my gynecologist regularly and I trust his opinion on conditions I am dealing with. He explains it to me clearly so I can understand what is going on and he makes me feel comfortable. He gets to know me as a person aside from just a patient and makes me feel like he cares about my overall well being. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor (cardiologist) very much. He has a great reputation and has a great amount of skill and knowledge.
0.480000	I distrust doctors a bit in general because I've had bad experiences in the past with doctors leading me down the wrong path. At the end of the day they are still just human and I believe it should be a team process in finding the best treatment for you since you are the one that has to live with the consequences. 
0.800000	She was recommended to me by a friend i trust. She listens to my concerns and addresses them. She is warm, sympathetic, and seems very intelligent and competent.
0.640000	If I have taken the steps to be in the presence of a healthcare professional, I have exhausted my own body of knowledge and MUST trust them to investigate further and explain the options for treatment as they may be. Their schooling and Hippocratic oath make them the only option at that point, hence one has no option but to trust someone, why not a trained and certified medical professional. 
0.800000	I trust him because he seems to really know what he is doing, and was able to treat my infection correctly. He is also very kind and caring and seems to really care about the patients.
0.400000	I feel they do not care to put in the time to really figure out and discuss health complaints and often rush patients in and out. I do not fully trust them for fixing health issues.
0.480000	Honestly I think its more about money than care of the patient. There is never a sense of urgency with doctors. 
0.440000	They have given me wrong diagnosis before- leading to wrong medication and side effects and addition to the HUGE bills!!!
0.480000	I have Type 2 diabetes and I know that my condition is not as serious as everybody else since every time I'm eating a healthy diet, my numbers stay stable and I would feel great. My doctor keeps trying to push insulin to me even though, I know I don't need it. She even mentioned that they are normally told by their providers to try to offer insulin more towards patients. They try to restrict my refills for a diabetic medicine that I normally need just so that they could make me come in and so that they can charge my insurance company. They won't give me refills until I check-in with them, which for something standard like Diabetes, I don't think I need.
0.880000	"My primary care physician is a very thoughtful doctor.  He listens closely to what I have to say, and thinks about his responses.  He has a lot of experience, and he seems to have a ""conservative"" approach, in that he doesn't immediately jump to an aggressive treatment."
0.560000	i do trust my primary care doctor as he has been my personal physician for over year now. He always thinks good about us and give us good medication . 
0.400000	Based on anecdotes and past experiences, doctors cannot be trusted many times. Sadly, there are a lot of doctors who will play with your lives for the money. That is not to say all doctors are like that, but you have to be careful.
0.800000	My primary care physician is also my mother's primary care physician and has been since I was 7. He became mine when I was 18 and before that point would ask my mother about how I was doing. He is also a rheumatologist and I have rheumatoid arthritis and have since I was 11. He remembers extremely minor details and things about me and my health without having to look through my file every time I visit. He is extremely busy but always takes time to follow up and is very thorough. He is willing to recommend I take a treatment that he cannot provide and is genuinely interested in keeping me in the best health possible.
0.960000	I have seen my current doctor for several years now. he has always listened to my concerns and has worked with me in finding the best treatment that iI need.
1.000000	I mean, it is their job to make sure that I receive the best care possible. I am sure they don't want to be facing some sort of repercussions based on how they care for me. I would like to think that they became doctors to help people like me to get the best care they can administer, and so it would be somewhat out of character if they were to skimp on my care.
0.560000	I trust my doctor but if I had a serious illness I would see a specialist and if I was given a new medication I would investigate it before taking it.
0.480000	I have not really found a good primary care physician yet. I had a good one, but he retired. The new one I have found so far has not impressed me. He is ok, but I don't feel as comfortable talking to him and sometimes feel like he jumps to conclusions about me or my condition without fully evaluating the information I have provided.
0.800000	I really trust and respect my doctor.  He takes a lot of time with me at each appointment and always asks me a bunch of questions.  He is kind and seems like he really cares about me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor to the extent that he does not want me to die.  But I am not 100% confident that he has presented me with all the available remedies for my situation as there are new drugs and theories being discovered yearly.
0.880000	My doctor seems professional; I have no reason to distrust their advice given to me with regards to my health. Every step they've taken when I've been unwell has made a lot of sense and ultimately helped me.
0.600000	Sometimes when I visit my doctor, I feel extremely rush and unimportant. Other days, I feel like my doctor actually listens to my problems and needs 
0.600000	It is not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician. Instead, it is simply wanting to question things in order to protect myself regardless. This method works for my best interest.
0.480000	There have been many times over the past several years that I've gone to doctors with medical complaints, probably all coming from the same source, and left their care with no real effective plan of treatment, and limited insight about what precisely is going wrong with my health, and this applies to primary care physicians, and specialists, and ER doctors. It seems pretty clear that either they can't treat whatever is wrong with me, or just don't care.
0.520000	I have family in the health care business and would trust them whole heartedly. I think that it is important to have trust in your doctors. They go through a lot of training and pledge an oath to provide to their patients as well as they can.
0.800000	I generally trust my primary care physician because she consistently treats me with respect and listens to my needs. She's also willing to say when she's unsure about something and when I need to seek additional resources or opinions, rather than pretending to know everything about everything. 
0.760000	I did quite a bit of research before I finally selected my doctor.  She has very good reviews from other parents, and works for a very reputable institution, Johns Hopkins.  Most of my interactions with her have been extremely positive and she has given me no reason not to trust her judgment.  My one concern is that she seems to be extremely busy, and probably feels pressure not to spend much more than 15 minutes with any of her patients.
0.680000	My PCP means well (and I do not at all mean that as a sarcastic comment) but like most PCPs in the days of managed care plans, he is overworked and cannot take the time to really get to know each patient thus some critical things can fall through the cracks unless I make a point of bringing them up to him.  Otherwise, he just orders blood work every three months and bases his whole appointment with me on the bloodwork results instead of, for example, looking at the fact that as a 60 year old woman with severe osteoporosis (due to my osteogenesis imperfecta) I am supposed to be having annual bone density scans.   I have to bring up things like bone density scans, mammograms, etc. to him myself because if it is not a blood test result, it will fall through the cracks.   In his defense, I will say, he orders thorough blood tests, goes over the results with me to make sure I understand them and when I do bring up something outside of the blood tests, he listens and works with me on it.  He is a good doctor, just overworked.  I don't trust him to be aware of my health conditions.  I do trust him to work with me when I remind him of what is going on with me.
0.840000	I have never had any reason not to trust her. All care I have received has been prompt and efficient and addressed any concerns/issues I had.
0.680000	I would have faith and hope that as a trained physician they are both skilled and have the knowledge and upkeep in the medical field. They do this as a living, doctors/nurses and physicians, so I should put at least some trust into their job that they are evaluating me and my health properly.
0.920000	My primary care physician has the qualifications and the experience to make the right decisions. She also takes into consideration my opinion and strives to give me the highest quality of life she can.
0.840000	My PA is extremely intelligent.  He listens to me, and he gives me credit for knowing something is wrong with my body.  He involves me in treatment planning.
0.760000	I think i can trust my primary care physician i feel that most doctors are honest people.some doctor my not be trustworthy but i have had no reason not to trust my doctor. if i thought my doctor could not be trusted i would look for another primary care physician.
0.720000	My physician does not rush me out of her office. She sits and talks with me and makes me feel like a person rather than just another face in her daily routine. She tells me about her past experiences as she is less than ten years older than me and has gone through a lot of the same things I have. She tells me what things she thinks are optional (flu shots, etc...) and what I really need to get done to stay healthy. 
0.720000	I have no reason to not trust him. I don't believe that he would knowingly do anything to harm me and he has no reason to lie to me. Also I've grown to trust him after seeing him for some time. 
0.760000	I trust my primary physician because they would have no reason to lie to me or falsify any information. They would not benefit at all from lying to me so it would not be worth doing that at all. 
0.880000	My physician does a great job of explaining things carefully and thoughtfully. He also believes in getting a second opinion when needed.
0.600000	I am not sure he takes the time to understand everything is happening to me. Sometimes I think his time is much more valuable than my health.
0.800000	I actually have a new PPC so I don't have a lot of experience with her.  From what I do know, I trust her and her judgement.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. He has been caring for me and my family for years and we have been in good health. he has always provided the correct recommendations and we have trust in him
1.000000	If a doctor has great bedside manner it makes it easy to trust them. Most of the doctors I have ever been to have had a great bedside manner which makes it feel like they are there for me and not just to do what is convenient for him/her. A doctor that is rude makes it hard to believe
0.800000	My doctor always gives me several options for and would be treatment I may need be it medicine, further testing and even sending me for second opinions.
1.000000	He is very, very thorough. He is older than me, so he uses alot of old fashioned methods. But that is good, because he takes his time and listens.
0.760000	I trust the doctors i see because of the training and education they receive. I do think there is a bit of opinion difference between different doctors but i think overall that is marginal in diagnosis. I do believe that in general almost all doctors and nurses are out for the patients best interest.
0.880000	I have been going to my Primary Care doctor for a few years.  Any concerns I have brought up she has addressed honestly, but in a caring and comforting way.  I am not talked down to and I am often presented with information and options. 
0.760000	I've been going to my primary physician for years and she has earned my trust. Also my mom who works in the medical field says nothing but praises for my primary physician.My primary physican gives me good advice and tries to maintain my health in the right area.
0.840000	I was going to the same primary care physician since i was very young. My mother personally knows my doctor so i feel very comfortable taking advice from that person. I think this person has good intentions and really wants to help me 
0.680000	In my case I have always looked for doctors who earn my trust. Currently my doctor is trusted because he has a lot of academic experience and also has a very good experience practicing what he already knows. During the consultations shows that he knows what he is doing, and that gives me confidence, something that is very important to deposit in a doctor
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he is a smart, competent person who is not in a rush and cares about providing my good advice and counsel.  But I also realize that there are limits to his experience and knowledge and he rarely runs tests to understand the problems.  So yes, I trust that he isn't lying but I don't always believe that he is correct.
0.480000	Pharmaceutical companies have alot of doctors and hospitals by the boot straps so if its not something that is paying their bills they are least likely to admit it. Example going hollistically versus a medication to help a small yet consistent pain is not going to come out their mouth much less approve you doing so already yourself
0.960000	My primary doctor is easy to communicate with, she provides easy to understand responses and is thorough.  She is part of a larger medical system that provides excellent care.  She works well with other doctors/staff from the larger system.  I can count on her.
0.400000	I lost a lot of trust in the medical field in general and especially with doctors while uncovering some information over the years. When I have learned that companies pay doctors to push their pharmaceuticals and also offer them incentive for prescribing their products and meeting up with them. Uncovering things like this just added to the distrust in the medical profession. 
0.280000	I don't trust my doctor. They just write things and don't say anything. They want to hurry up and get out of there. They always call me a liar. 
0.960000	I went to several Doctors to find the one that I have now.  My doctor will stay in the room with you until they have answered all questions.  My doctor does not let anything else distract him while you are being examined.  The doctor will ask several times if you understand or if you need them to go over anything else again.
1.000000	I have a strong trust in my provider. She has spent extra time with me when I needed it and followed up after stressful visits to make sure I fon't have more questions and to just check in with me.
0.720000	They are experienced and i feel that they know more about what is going on than i do.  I don't feel they are swayed by drug vendors often but that thought has crossed my mind before.  Overall i feel trusting of doctors.
0.800000	My doctor was really good, he seemed to care a lot for his patients. Sometimes you could tell, because he would go out of his way to do things that seemed above and beyond. He was also older so you knew he was putting forth more effort than someone who was younger.
0.720000	I believe that doctors are trained to be trustworthy and have taken an oath to put their patient's interest above all. Of course, there are some doctors who fail at patient interaction in any number of ways, but I believe them to be the minority.
0.880000	doctor seems competent, will answer any questions i have and usually explain things before i need them to be explained. very detailed and always up to date on task
0.960000	I trust what my doctor says about a medical condition. I have found that what I read about a given condition was in agreement with what the doctor said about the condition. I trust what my doctor says about a specialist to see. For example, if my doctor recommends a specialist doctor, I know it will be someone who is excellent. I have checked the patient reviews for a recommended specialist and found out that the reviews were consistent with what my doctor had said about the specialist.
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general. I believe that it all about the money so to speak. Medicine has caused more issues than the ailments it is said to assist with. If one medicine helps with one ailment for example, then it more than likely has at least ten side effects. Not to mention the costs of medicine. If someone is healthy, they make no money. 
0.760000	I have had a lot of changes with my primary care physician so I cannot always trust that the doctor I saw the last time will be the same doctor I see the next time, but the doctor that I have currently been seeing I have much trust in. 
0.480000	I do trust my doctor for most things but I do believe that doctors do not take people serious unless they can see actual signs themselves. Seems like most doctors send patients back home for a month to see if the symptoms go away or get worse. When most patients come in they have actually already been suffering from the problem for a long time but just waited to see the doctor. I do understand that some patients are lying to the doctor just to get medications or other things. It just seems like the patients really have to convinince the doctor that they really have these problems. I know it has to be hard for the doctors as well because they have to make sure they do not mistreat a patient even if that is what the patient wants. Of course, we have all heard about the few dirty doctors that have lied to patients about have cancer or other illnesses just to profit off the insurance money. We can't forgot about the many drug seeking patients that only want pain pills. That makes it hard on the people who are actually in pain or have cronic pain and really do need pain pills daily. 
0.960000	My NP seems to have a good grasp on medications I am to be prescribed, giving me confidence in taking it. If it works out not so well, she is on board with another medication that might help instead.
0.960000	They have many years of experience and tell me their thoughts and diagnoses without trying to put anything delicately or hiding any concerns.
0.600000	I have not been to a doctor in over 15 years, so I do not fully trust doctors, but that's not why I haven't been, I just know that unless its something very strange or a broken bone, most things go away with just taking care of yourself, good nutrition and staying hydrated works for me. I havent even used over the counter medicine at all in over 10 years. 
0.960000	I trust my Dr because he takes his time while I am there for my visit.  He leaves no stone unturned.  He always does blood work before the visits.  He orders appropriate test just in case.  He encourages me to continue on a healthy path.  He helps in dieting and what to eat and what not to eat.  I also trust my Dr because he is sought after by lots of patients.  He is always booked up.  He has been in the business for quite a few years.  
0.440000	She never remembers me.  I go in for one problem and she ignores it and instead complains about my weight.  I once went to her to acquire a sedative for a very stressful upcoming doctor appointment and she screamed at me saying if I take 4 Valium pills I will turn into an addict.  She also gets my age wrong every time.  I only go to her for referrals.  She is at an age where I think she needs to retire and every time I have been there I never see any patients in the waiting room.  Her online reviews are also terrible. 
0.760000	I know they are in the positions that they hold because of extensive education, experience and trust building with patients. They are able to answer all of my questions in a credible and convincing manner. I have had no breaches of trust to make me react otherwise.
1.000000	My doctor takes a great deal of time with his patients.  My last wellness visit lasted 1 1/2 hours.  I met with his assistant, his student doctor and him.  They took a full medical and social history.  Because he is a teaching doctor and has a 3rd year medical student working with him, he uses the questions I ask as an opportunity to educate both me and his student.  He runs all the tests he feels are needed to make sure I am in good physical shape.  He also counsels me on nutrition. 
0.840000	I trust my doctor because of his track record over the years with patients who aren't me and the fact that doctors can easily get in trouble for not doing the right thing.  
0.800000	All in all over the years going to the doctor has been a pleasant experience. The doctors I have visited have been kind and helpful. One reason I think I have such a positive opinion of doctors is because I rarely use them. 
0.720000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has extensive experience in her field. She is backed by a degree specializing in her area and she's had no complaints from me or any other patients. She makes me feel comfortable.
0.960000	My primary care physician was my pediatrician. I reconnected with him after 20 years. He is a good listener, and not fond of medications. Likes me to work out problems every other way before trying meds.
0.760000	I havent felt that my doctor has ever misled me in the past, nor given me bad advice. Whatever I went into the doctors for, eventually was healed or cured. 
0.840000	I mean he's my primary doctor. If i can't trust him i would go find a new one. It's very important to have a doctor you trust in because if not you won't be able to get the treatment you deserve.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is somebody who I have known for quite some time. I trust that he has my best interests at heart and will always make sure that his decisions reflect where I want to be with the treatment. 
0.800000	My physician likes to push different new medications on me instead of worrying about the side effects that I would have in taking these medications. I do get a great deal from my physician in the way of ordering test and sharing about my disease. I wish that my physician cared about my daily issues and not so much about the different medications they want me to try. My doctor comes off as a drug pusher at times. I also feel as if my doctor is always in a rush and that makes me lose my concentration.
0.440000	When my doctor is not rushed and has time he always answers my questions and does not rush me.  When he is very busy I feel as though he ignores me and does not take what I say into consideration.  I trust him when he explains his decisions to me but I do not trust rushed and unexplained decisions.  
0.760000	I feel like not trusting a doctor is foolish. It takes an incredible amount of dedication, smarts, and experience to become a doctor. I trust experts in most places where it makes sense, unless something seems off about them. I might be less inclined to trust a doctor where I was not as sure of his credentials, like maybe in a third world country. I do not have a primary care physician to think to but I would like to think If i Did, I would place a great deal of trust in them to give me accurate advice. If I did no trust the doctor, I would pretty quickly find a new one.
0.960000	"I don't have a primary care physician, I pretty much just go to whoever I'm sent to.  To put it simply, I haven't run into any doctors who did NOT give me any reason to trust them.  All of them have been professional.  True, one of them didn't have a good ""bedside manner"", but that was it.  He still got the job done.  "
0.760000	I have never had a bad experience with a doctor. I always ask questions and have an open dialog. It works for me.
0.520000	My PCP is not somebody that I see very often. I have not gone to my PCP regularly for about 5 years now. I only go if there is something seriously wrong, which has only been like 2 times in the past 5 years.
0.960000	My doctor has taken an oath to provide the best care and help ensure I am healthy. I trust their advice and guidance in terms of my wellness. I have no reason to believe that my doctor is anything but straight forward with me.
0.440000	I somewhat distrust doctors in general to take the time to explain all treatment options because they are in such a hurry and want to get to the next patient to make more money. I don't think they want to waste time to followup when patients need additional explanation, help, or guidance with their situation.
0.520000	I don't go to the Dr all the often, but when I did, it always seemed like he was in a rush. I would tell him what was ailing me, but it felt like he was just talking at me instead of to me. It felt like he never took me seriously. He has since moved on to another practice out of state, but I don't miss my former doctor at all.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician completely. He is wise, sensible, practical. He always has time for questions or discussion on issues important to me. He has never steered me wrong.
0.800000	For the most part, I put a great deal of trust in my doctors.  I listen to their diagnosis and try to ask relevant questions until I have a good understanding of the condition and subsequent treatment plan.  I do however try to verify on my own and if I do have more questions, I do not hesitate to get a second opinion from another reputable health care provider.  I have, however, not had a bad experience with the various doctors that I have sought treatment from. 
1.000000	I trust my physician because I have known him for years. We used to work side by side in the hospital. I know without a doubt that he will tell me things honestly even if it goes against what his normal protocols are. I am fortunate to have this relationship with him.
0.840000	I have always had trust in my primary physician.  He has a great bed-side manner and is very personable and explains things very well.  My father was a physician and I am able to relate to him because of this.  I also know that he his telling me the truth that I need to hear as this is the same things that I heard from my father.  I respect his years of service in the industry as well as he has practiced his trade for over 20 years.  I also trust the people that recommended this physician to me.
0.960000	This specialist has been my doctor for fours.  I have multiple medical issues, all complex.  The doctor has a very high knowledge of the diagnosis and treatments, and gives me all the options.  I trust this doctor very much
0.240000	I have been misdiagnosed so many times by doctors that I do not trust them to be able to help me in any capacity. They seem to have their own motives in mind and do not care about the actual problem I'm experiencing or finding a solution. I feel like the reason they are in their profession is solely to make as much money as they can.
0.760000	For the most part I trust him but there are times when he seems to give me contradictory information from visit to visit and that makes me nervous. For example, one time my cholesterol will be borderline high and he'll mention it as something I need to work on then next time it will be extremely high and he won't say anything.
0.560000	Very few doctor visits are completely satisfactory, maybe because my expectations are too high. I think that if you see the medical profession as just another job, you tend to just try to go through and get over with any patient care at hand as quickly as you can. 
0.680000	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part because I develop an relationship with this person for a couple of years now. I know when I need something urgently, they will always be there when I go for help for me and my family.
0.760000	my doctor is only telling me whats best for me. He has my best interest in mind when I have an appointment with him. He is only trying to get me to stay healthy or get me back to that point.
0.560000	I do a LOT of research on my own, because I suffer from chronic conditions. When I see a doctor, they don't always mention all of the options available. The docs are double and triple booked in 15 minute time slots, so they don't have a lot of time with each patient. They hardly have the time to fully discuss EVERYTHING that's going on and maybe connect some dots that could be connected. 
0.680000	Again working in the medical field I see things that worry me and make me more cautious.  Such as, a Dr that delivers too many c sections because he has plans for the weekend and doesn't want to get called in. Or a doctor that doesnt explain appropriately to the patient, or even worse doesn't even see the patient and provides service thru only looking at a chart. 
0.240000	"I think the vast majority of doctors become insensitive to their patients and their problems.  In fact, I think they lose the ability to even recognize that their patients are people.  They seem to push whatever ""treatments"" benefit themselves the most financially, without any regard to how that's going to affect their patients financially or otherwise.  "
0.840000	although trust has inherent as well as instrumental value for patients, clinicians, and healthcare institutions, trust can be misplaced, and distrust can be unjustified. Thus, if a physician reveals truthfully to a patient how s/he is paid, trust in the physician may diminish as a result of this trustworthy behavior.
0.760000	I trust that my primary care physician makes good choices and care about me. He is very knowledgeable about his expertise and always very patient to answer my questions. He will analysis different options to me and don't pressure me to make a choice he preferred.
0.360000	"I don't trust my primary care physician because she didn't listen to me when I told her the things which were bothering the most. Instead she arranged expensive tests simply because I'm of an age where I need them and should have them first to rule out things before moving on to the things I am most concerned about. I understand that logic, but when a person is in pain and can pinpoint exactly where that pain is, this information shouldn't be ""put off"" in lieu of routine procedures, no matter if you are due for them or not. "
0.440000	"In the current times it seems doctors easily push the strongest drugs on a patient. By saying this I don't mean to suggest any link to the opioid crisis in the country. For instance, my last emergency care visit was last year when I had a kidney stone. This wasn't the first time I've ever had one (2nd time in the emergency room for it in 10 years), and they gave me extremely harsh prescriptions. One of the medications prescribed was Ciprofloxacin instead of pencillin to fight bacteria (I apparently had a UTI). After only taking ""Cipro"" a total of 3 times, it gave me deep pain in my joints that lasted for over 6 months. I could hardly walk and I definitely couldn't bend my knees. I think doctors  jump the gun with a lot of medications instead of starting ""small"" to see what works. I tend to believe doctors now are really careless with all the serious side effects because they spend so little time with patients."
0.480000	I trust a physician to truly want wha tis best, but I do not trust that they will pick the best solution instead of prescirbing the easiest pharmaceutical drug or highest paying one.
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for over 15 years. He is very honest and down to earth. I have always taken the advice of my primary care doctor with excellent results. 
0.600000	My primary care physician is okay for routine care, but I have never been so sick that I needed extra attention. If something big were to go wrong with my physician, I'm not sure I would trust her completely without a second opinion. She has been fine so far, but I'm generally healthy.
0.760000	Usually, when I have several questions about something that is going ion when my health, my doctor usually has all the answers to whatever my questions are to put my mind at ease. Sometimes, I have my doubts about the answers and then just google search more about when we talked about or on my visit I will ask more questions and he will answer them once again to put my mind at ease.
0.760000	Doctors in general seem to want to prescribe the most efficient treatment possible in my opinion. I've only ever had one experience where I felt like the doctor was rushing me along or not really listening to any concerns I had.
0.680000	It's their job and usually their calling, so I trust them inasmuch as it makes sense. They're still fallible human beings and I don't mind seeking second opinions. 
1.000000	I trust him very much because when I needed help with something he referred me in the right direction. That next experience was a healthy and good experience for me that has made me healthier.
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor completely. I had a great doctor but he transferred and I got stuck with this guy. I want to change doctors but I am still trying to give this guy a chance because maybe he will get better with time. I know that he tries on his diagnosis but have found that I have had to go to a urgent care more than once because he doesn't get it right.
0.960000	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  He's one of the few good ones left that takes the time to get to know you and talk to you.  I feel like he's a close friend when I'm there.
0.760000	I've been with my primary doctor for years and he's already proven himself to me. He was able to dispose sinus problems I have work recommending Claritin D and Flonase daily. Others kept referring me to ENTs who have me no real answers to my constant sinus infections.
0.680000	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE THEY GIVE THEM THEIR BEST TO  HELP  IN OUR WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY AND GOOD . THEY ALWAYS SUGGEST GOOD THINGS .
0.800000	All of the doctors that I have interacted with over the past few years have been understanding and compassionate about my current situations. Sometimes I feel like they haven't been completely helpful in finding solutions to some of our health problems, but I've never felt like they haven't been doing their best job to communicate and give me options. 
0.880000	I think my doctor is often busy but is very concerned about my care. He does listen and tries to take time.  He cares more about what is good for me and will schedule more tests and or refer me to another doctor he knows and truest.  Overall he's very good but I always like to check on things myself so I do have to questions what he tells me or get a second opinion and he encourages this.  So far my primary care physician has been very accurate and has offered good advice or treatment.
0.600000	I have been seeing my PCP for 10 years and he has always been very good in all ways until two years ago I was sick and nobody could figure out what was wrong. My Dr told me I was just beginning the change of life called perimenopause and had nothing to worry about. I knew that was not right I was much to sick for it to be normal. I went through 5 additional Drs trying to get answers and even specialists. I finally found one Dr who actually sat down and talked to me for an hour which never happens but he could see how sick I was and I had lost so much weight I weighed 81lbs....so he did a whole battery of blood tests and finally after 2 years of being mostly bedridden I had an answer. It was or could have been found in the beginning if my Dr would have listened to me and just did some bloodwork. After that I will go to my regular pcp but I don't trust him after that, he could have killed me. I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia which is a vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Thank God for that one Dr and my gut instincts.
0.960000	The general care practitioner I go to is really good. They do the basics really well and I don't ever really require anything besides some antibiotics every 7-10 years anyway.
0.640000	I think that they will try to keep me sick so that they can make money off of me for as long as they can.
0.960000	In my case, my primary care physician is also a good personal friend that I've known since before he was my doctor.  We built a relationship of trust before we had a business relationship and that has carried over into seeing him as a doctor.  Any time I have had an issue I have honestly expressed it to him and he has given me straight answers on what my options are and what the possible outcomes were.
0.720000	I trust my PCP because she tells it like it is. I have met doctors before who cautiously agree with whatever the patient says, because maybe they don't want to alienate or be subject to poor reviews. But my internist is very candid.
0.560000	My physician is currently near the end of her fifth pregnancy and sheâs pretty tired.  I expect things will get better but Iâve been relying more on her nurse practitioner.
0.440000	My current primary care doctor is only concerned with my weight. In her mind any issue that arises could be solved if I would lose some weight. She always makes sure the address my weight at each visit and ensure that I am aware of the negative ways that being overweight could affect me. She assumes that I will become addicted to certain medications just because I am overweight.
0.960000	I've being going to my doctor for over 35 years.  I trust him explicitly.  He has always been there for me and my family.
0.760000	I typically trust my primary care physician unless they are inattentive or give me a reason not to trust them. If they lose my trust then I just find a new doctor and I do not give them the chance to betray me a second time. 
0.800000	My family and I have been with the practice for a long time. The experience is always comfortable and open and honest.
0.600000	I like my primary physician but she often seems rushed. I'm sure she is honest but not always sure she's thinking very much about what I tell her.
0.640000	I mostly trust my primary care doctor. I trust them in addressing my concerns and treating my problem appropriately. Sometimes, I feel like doctors differ over what treatment option is best so I get a second opinion.
0.480000	I have had several doctors over my lifetime and I don't trust quite a few of them. If they don't listen or believe what I report about my own health then I can't really trust them to make accurate diagnoses or appropriate treatments
0.760000	I feel that my doctor has often gone out of her way to help since I am in a very dire financial situation. As well she has given me advice and recommendations for alternative treatments for certain problems I have had i.e.she does not believe that drugs are a cure-all but helps me get to the root of certain health conditions.
0.520000	I don't have a primary care physician. I sometimes go off of family/friends opinions of a doctor that I am seeing. In general I'm not sure that I trust doctors completely. I think that sometimes they aren't as thorough as they could be because they are trying to get you out of the office so that they can move on to the next patient.
0.800000	My doctor has given me pretty good advice at my annual physicals without being overly pushy or forward about it. He's personable and laid back and seems to have my best interests at heart.
0.360000	I currently do not have a primary care physician, but the one that I previously had did not seem to care that much about me or understand how I was feeling. I distrusted her, because she didn't take much time to listen to what I had to say about my thyroid, symptoms, and she didn't act like she wanted to help me. I felt like my previous primary care physician treated me more like a number, rather than a patient.
0.760000	I trust my personal care provider most of the time. She errs on the side of caution. Some doctors at hospital are terrible at listening to complaints and refuse to consider the underlying pain when they hear the word cancer.
0.680000	I am currently between primary care physicians because my insurance coverage and physical location has changed several times recently. But when I did have a regular primary care physician(s) which I did for many years, I felt that in general I could trust them. However, in all cases I do my own research and use logic whenever possible. I try to avoid any and all medications, which I feel is too often the focus of physicians, to push drugs. For that reason, I canât say that I ever have complete trust in a doctor.  I take pretty much anything a physician might say or do with a âgrain of saltâ, always considering the possibility that the drug factor could be playing a significant role.
0.800000	I have never had a reason to distrust them. I have had a somewhat wrong diagnosis in the past, but this wasn't a major issue and they directed me to someone who could provide me with a more accurate diagnosis and method of treatment. 
0.560000	She is a fine doctor, but very busy and does not seem to spend the time necessary to think through all of the options or which option is most likely - she picks something that might be an answer and we move forward.  It's OK, I trust that she is being honest, but I don't trust that she has the right answer.
0.400000	In general I have a distrust for my primary care physician and doctors in general. I feel this way because whenever I have had a medical issue it is rare that I get any kind of resolution or any real help. I feel that doctors are so quick to medicate and not find out what the underlying issue is creating the problem. Because any doctors are of any real help I try to avoid going to them even when I need it. It seems like no matter how many blood tests or other kinds of medical tests one gets there is never any resolution to the problem only a cover up of the problem. I feel like doctors just cover the surface and never really dig deep to understand the problem. I do believe there are rare doctors that will dig deep and get the medical problem and try to solve it, but these doctors are extremely rare. In addition I feel like doctors do not take time with their patients anymore. There is no caring. It feels like they try to see as many patients as possible and never really take the time to get to know someone and their needs. In all I can't trust doctors anymore. At one time I trusted them more but I have seen the medical profession really decline in quality of care. 
0.640000	I trust what is said, but sometimes I feel like I am not a person to my doctor, and he could misread my symptoms.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician, in part because my father, who was also a physician had recommended him. All my interactions with him are positive and he has genuine concern and interest in my health.
0.920000	My primary care physician has already proven her abilities to me. Three years ago I almost died from an acute COPD flareup that just would not get better. My Dr. took care of me, made sure I understood what was going on and how much danger I was in, hospitalized me and treated me. she then changed my whole maintenance med routine to improve my overall health. At this time she was the ER Dr on duty not my primary care Dr. After that hospitalization I changed her to my primary care Dr. I knew I would never find a Dr more dedicated to my health and I trust her 100%
0.840000	I have a complete trust  my primary care physician.They dont lie about my health reports and provide me actual information about my health.They even help me understood if anything is hard know about my health conditions.
0.680000	I just had my first appointment with my new provider so I don't know him well, but he was very thorough and organized, however when I told him my L4 dermatome below my knee was numb he googled it with me and as he was doing so said he didn't think that was the L4 dermatome. It was. Then he googled a few conditions in front of me and suggested I might have diabetes. I live a pretty healthy active lifestyle and have no other symptoms, and diabetes numbness usually starts in hands and feet and is tingly or painful. I am on a soccer team of physical therapists and they all checked me out and said it was likely a contusion or compression. My sister checked me out and said the same thing. I asked about diabetes and they all thought that was ridiculous. Why was he googling so many things in our appointment? Just say you're not sure, I don't expect you to know everything, but making things up, reaching, or googling diagnoses (which I already did more effectively, not webmd nonsense) doesn't instill confidence. But he seemed like he genuinely wanted me to leave feeling taken care of, and that's more than a lot of doctors.
0.640000	I trust my doctor to an extent. They seem very passionate and wonderful whenever I am a patient, but it's hard to get in touch with them. They don't always have great follow through and they always seem rushed. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor. If there's ever a time that I don't, I don't have a problem getting a second opinion from another doctor. That doesn't mean that I don't trust him as a whole, just that in a certain situation, I would like to know that he is consistent with another doctor. I feel that I can trust my doctor because he seems invested in me. He know about me personally, and he shows true interest in my life.
0.840000	I have worked hard to find a physician who will listen to and believe me when I talk about my health.  My doctor not only listens but acts on what I am telling her.  I trust her because we work as a team when it comes to my health concerns.
0.760000	I have been seeing my PCP for almost 8 years, so we have developed a pretty good relationship, and I do trust her. I trust her so much that my children also see her. There are some areas that I feel she isn't expert on, but that is why she refers us to specialists.
0.760000	My primary care physician is really good. She is hired by my company and not her own doctor's office, so she really cares about taking the time to listen and explain things to me. 
0.640000	I am not currently on pain medication, but if I were I would be extremely wary of having only one doctor's opinion due to the prescription opiate addiction epidemic that is sweeping the United States. 
0.720000	I trust him because he has taken care of the sickness I have had and my family has had.  I do sometimes have trouble understanding what the nurses call me back about for diagnosis
0.560000	"I believe that doctors see a lot of people and give a lot of ""canned"" answers that are probably good advice but aren't tailored to each person individually."
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been treating me ever since I was little. My mother was taking me to a different doctor when I was younger and he was repeatedly misdiagnosing my illness. My mother got frustrated and switched doctors, the one of which is still my current primary care physician.
0.680000	Its been a mixed bag for me some doctors are really good at what they do and others not so much, its been 5050 for me so far. its rather difficult and finding a good doctor has been inconsistent 
0.520000	I feel I can trust my primary care doctor within reason.  I do feel some of the newer drugs he tries to put me on are because he gets some sort of kick back.  I question if these drugs are really in my best interest or in his.  I also feel that sometimes he doesn't listen to what I am saying and just goes by the book.  
0.960000	I typically trust my doctor and am not afraid to raise concerns if I do not agree with something she says or does.  She typically puts my concerns first and knows that I like to weigh all of my options when it comes to making any decisions.  I am not afraid to find another doctor if I do not agree with the way any of my medical problems are being handled and any doctor I see I make sure and let them know.
0.480000	I know doctors just want to push pills most of the time. I have been fortunate to find a doctor who would rather treat me with something natural first before going to extreme measures. I have had doctors int he past who just want to prescribe something and want you to stick to it no matter what.
0.920000	I trust her because she is extremely personable, takes her time to really understand ALL my symptoms. She discussed different options and different ways of handling everything and gives me a set of difference choices based on my needs. She even seeks out sheaper medications due to my low income
0.760000	I like my doctor to take their time and sometimes that doesn't happen.  But, she does what she can.  She answers questions and perscribes what is needed.  
0.520000	I am not sure if I completely trust my primary care physician because he seems more concerned about liability or convenience at times rather than in the welfare of the patient. He is not as open to answering questions about medical care. He also is not as uptodate on treatments and may recommend something that he is familiar with but may not be as effective as more new or modern treatments.
0.680000	Doctors are human.  Yes, they are highly trained and can have lots of experience, but mistakes still happen.  Sometimes it's a simple fault, and sometimes it's due to complacency.  In any case, I bear the responsibility for my health, not them.  They can make suggestions and offer advice, but it is ultimately up to me what happens to maintain my health.
0.880000	I trust my dr because he is always up front and honest with me and tells me all. He always listens to my concerns and is always listening and helping me out. He is a caring dr. Not one that just gets you in and out to make money.
0.760000	 I generally have trust in my doctor's motives. I have bad reactions to some prescribed medications but, the doctor was not careless or incorrect in prescribing them for me.  The two bad experiences I had were; a doctor who wanted to do a surgical procedure in office with local anesthesia that, as I found out when I had it done in hospital, would have likely killed me if I had allowed him to proceed, and a doctor who took a phone call while suturing me and allowed a poorly trained nurse to finish the job. Big scar! I have had many more doctors who went the extra mile and saved my life or health through being extra thorough with my diagnosis.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing her for over five years and she has never given me information I have found to be false.  She discusses health issues with me and takes my concerns into consideration
0.680000	I went through few primary doctors. Some are trustable more than other. Over all i trust them because i don't know any better than them. Of course, i make sure i understand what they are saying and what they mean. What are the advantage and disadvantage of particular medicine or treatment before i make my decision? If i  have a certain condition and if i don't trust them then that not good for my health. If i am doubtful then i will take the second opinion. But i will not ignore completely what my doctor is saying.
0.760000	I trust my physician to be analyzing any potential issues and recommending appropriate and safe treatments for me in order to recover.
0.560000	I think doctors sometimes have people's best interest but not always. Sometimes they are too busy or in it for the money they can milk depends
0.720000	I trust my family doctor because I have had health issues come up or things that have bothered me for awhile and other family doctor's couldn't seem to help fix or get the right medication for the problem but this doctor has helped me every time, so I feel she knows what she is doing and I trust her.
0.800000	I believe that most doctors are good hearted; they do their best for the patient, Iâve only have a few bad moments with some doctors, but in general they are to be trusted.
0.400000	I sometimes feel doctors are overbooked and a result hurry too much with each patient. I also feel that sometimes they are a bit too confident in what they think and dont explore other options well enough just to be safe.
0.800000	He has taken the time out to really make sure I understood concepts by drawing pictures, which I haven't experienced with other doctors. He is against the use of certain medications that are addictive, but the most helpful in situations. I needed an anti anxiety medicine that would help and he preferred to prescribe medicine that did not really help rather than giving me medicine that absolutely would. 
0.920000	My primary caregiver has been honest and straight forward since my first visit years ago. I visited for a large splinter that had become infected in my leg. Instead of recommending a costly incision to remove it, he first recommended antibiotics to help the swelling go down with hopes to remove it naturally. I appreciate someone who goes down every possible path to ensure you get the care you need, not the most expensive.
0.360000	Many times they simply do not listen to concerns especially in relation to medications. They tend to trust too much in medications that can cause serious side effects and don't realize how much they can negatively impact your life. Specifically I was given medication that was not working well for me but the doctor kept telling me to give it time. I listened and regretted it. I lost most of my hair and gained about 40 pounds by the time I gave up and stopped taking the medication. The doctor was not empathetic or concerned about the effects but the experience had a very negative and lasting affect on my life. I've had more than my share of negative outcomes due to poor medical advice. My son also went through years of unnecessary treatment due to a misdiagnosis. So I can't say that I fully trust any doctor's medical advice.
0.640000	Doctors are human. Most of them are careful and want to help their patients. Some are better at keeping up-to-date with the newest best practices than others. So, depending on how many doctors are in your area and how good your insurance is, most people who can afford medical care can find a decent doctor who keeps their best interests in mind.
0.520000	"Because many doctors are either a) trying to get through patients as quickly as possible; b) trying the safest (and not always most effective) solutions that minimize their own liability; c) have a ""band aid"" approach to medicine that treats symptoms rather than the underlying cause, and d) depend on medications and writing prescriptions. Furthermore, most doctors are not interested in preventative care and have very little good advice on nutrition. "
0.800000	My doctor seems to be very personable and has my best interest in mind.  She is very down to earth and is someone I can talk to easily.  I think she is doing what is best for my current health, and I know she is educated to make those decisions.  Doctors in general I have dealt with I usually trust.  There have been a few exceptions, but if I don't have a good fit I seek a 2nd opinion.
0.680000	I feel like they see so many patients in a given day, that they do not remember you on a personal level, therefore they do not really have a clue what you're really going through.  I trust what they think based on ME having to point out every single little symptom I experience.  
0.760000	I trust my care physician because they go above and beyond what I expect or what I am even interested in.  My physician is completely thorough during my physical and I feel like they want to give the best care possible.
0.560000	Reasons I trust doctors would be because they have more knowledge and experience in the medical field as well as medical problems. Reasons I distrust doctors, would be because sometimes they want to just prescribe medication instead of getting to the root cause of a medical condition.
0.840000	I feel like my doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and address them. He doesn't blow off what I say even if it takes us a little while to figure out what is going on.
1.000000	All of my physicians are thorough, personable, and genuine. They never make me feel rushed or like they only do things that are convenient for them. They always provide me with extensive information while weighing in on the pros and cons of each possible outcome. 
0.720000	Faith based, honest, she is very thourough when I come in to see her seems concerning. The nurses aid is very helpful as well. If u don't have trust in your doctor then you need to change
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because this person has had many, many years of school, and dedicated their life to making sure they explore, examine and treat those that are in their care for different illnesses. I have little medical knowledge so I always listen to my physician. However, that doesn't mean I listen blindly. I always do my own research and get a second opinion.  
0.760000	in the past she has misdiagnosed me when i was having pain problems, but most of the time she has been very thorough and good
0.480000	Doctors are taught to go by numbers or by what testing says.  They do not listen to what their patients symptoms.  I have hypothyroidism and have normal numbers but I still have symptoms.  My doctor insists that my symptoms have nothing to do with my thyroid.  I have done my own research and know for a fact that other thyroid patients have symptoms despite having normal numbers.   I wish my doctor would listen to my symptoms and not my numbers
0.720000	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind but at times they have to many patients and to many things going on and they make quick decisions that may not always be the right one even if they think it was at the time  
0.520000	its happen couple times when i went to my primary care physician she was wrong about my illness then i had to ask her about it and then she used to prescribe other medicine. i dont trust now days to doctors. most of them look in google for clues.   
0.800000	I have been with my PCP for over 20 years and we have pretty much grown up together (HA).  She is very careful and complete in her care for me.  She has usually been right is her recommendations for any treatment I have needed.  However, I always will retain my right to make my own healthcare decisions if I disagree with her recommendation.
0.320000	I believe the medical field is too dependent on money, creating big profits while minimizing care to patients.  This trickles down most heavily on the doctors who make the call to run certain tests or not and to dedicate enough time to caring for patients.  I believe there is too much pressure on doctors to overmedicate patients as well.
0.720000	"Normally and previously I have had total confidence in her. However recently my medical needs have started to conflict with what is ""popular"" to do because of certain topics in the media. Though no one has told me that is the reason. I have been given NO reason why I'm being denied effective treatment. "
0.640000	I trust because he has valued me in a correct way and I consider him to be a capable person since he has experience and many patients have been valued by him and I feel satisfied with this
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician. My primary care physician always tells me what is going on with my health and answers all of my questions. She recommends things and tells me how I might feel during procedures which turned out to be true.
0.760000	My primary care doctor is new to me, so Iâll answer about doctors in general. I have a lot of experience with doctors, and for the most part I think they are honest and trustworthy. But I know that in a busy clinic that has a lot very ill patients, there is  a lot of shuffling of priorities. One day you may have the doctorâs full attention, other days you may not. Also, Iâve had enough errors in my treatment over the years (none fatal) to know that doctors and nurses are not infallible. They prescribe the wrong dosage, or donât fully investigate drug interactions, etc.
0.400000	Because there decision is made off of generals. They are not specialist. If I tell my PCP that I am not overweight but I eat well(veggies, all organic) they will at the end tell me to eat better. 
0.840000	I have a holistic doctor, who is a trained MD and oriental medicine practitioner. I trust her guidance and follow her instructions, but I don't ignore my own intuition if it conflicts with what she says.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is caring and seems very wise. She has been a doctor for many years and always has good answers to my questions. I've verified many things she's told me on websites such as Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins and she is always correct.
0.760000	I like that the dr takes the time to listen and make sure to understand what is going on and to make me feel like a person that can get better and do well.
0.680000	I just started with a new doctor and I like her a good bit. However, this has not been the case in general with doctors giving me medications without telling me what exactly they're meant to solve, what interactions I should be aware of, or what side effects to expect. I end up doing a tremendous amount of googling to make sure I'm not missing something. 
0.720000	I have never had problems with them.  They always listen to me, as they know I have some medical background, and then we discuss options.  I always leave appointments knowing that it was the right decision.
0.800000	The doctor I have now asks about the family and seems to remember things about them. Seems to care about me taking care of myself. That comes across in his tone and approach to the visits.
0.440000	Doctors now days are taught to get a patient in and out.  Very few take the time to really hear what you are saying and even fewer spend the time that is needed to find out what the root problem is.  They usually give you some med and it is just a band-aid and you will have to come back at a later time.  Some older physicians still take time but most of the young ones do not.
0.600000	I some what trust but sometimes I feel like I am not being heard and the doctor is always in such a rush that he doesn't listen to me
0.680000	It is not that I do not trust my doctor as much as I am aware that he is human, has a lot on his plate and is therefore subject to error.  I do believe in getting a second option when I don't believe that a concern is been met.
0.840000	i trust my doctor, she seems very capable and have a lot of knowledge, i always follow her instructions and get better
0.880000	I find my self without any reason whatsoever as to why I should not trust my doctor. I have always followed his transcriptions and every time I get cured. I therefore have gained a lot of confidence and trust in him. 
0.760000	I researched my condition and I was given a treatment plan that included medication and one that included a natural change in my diet. This was the same research that I did prior to consulting with my doctor. Thus, no medication or plan is being forced upon me. Also, I was able to express my discomfort with the medication that I was using and I was switched to a different medication. 
1.000000	I haven't been to my primary care physician in a while due to no longer having health insurance, but I'll do my best to explain. I typically take good care of myself and try to avoid going to the doctor's office at all costs. The main reason that I would visit her is because of my IBS, which is something that she also suffers from, so I know that she understands what I'm going through. More generally, you never feel like you're being rushed. She always listens to whatever you need to say about your issues, no matter how long you go on about it.
0.760000	So far Iâve only had minor medical issues and in all cases the doctors have been very willing to explain everything and answer all my questions.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because she knows me really well. She has been my doctor since I was 4 years old so she knows the ins and outs of all my health issues better than any other doctor. On a personal level, she has been there for me in times of need and has gone above and beyond her call of duty.
0.760000	In general I trust my primary care physician as they have demonstrated their honesty in the past. Additionally, I trust most doctors in general. Furthermore, it takes a certain type of personality to be a primary care physician. They are stereotypically honest, trustworthy, and caring.
0.840000	I think that my primary care physician sometimes doesn't take my interests into account. That makes me feel like my doctor isn't completely trustworthy. I have told them about how I've tried solutions that they suggest, but I am not receiving alternative solutions after saying so.
0.920000	the dr I refer to is my oncologist who has treated me for Stage IV breast cancer that is metastatic.  It will be 6 yrs in July that I was diagnosed and also had major surgery to remove a mass in my colon that was also cancerous.  I feel without their careful and thoughtful medical expertise I may not be alive.  I see my oncologist to check my lab levels and also to receive the next round of oral chemotherapy.  I feel it is in my best interest to trust him and I do.
0.640000	I donât anyone should have complete trust in doctors. Different doctors can offer different opinions. A lot of doctors are also in the pocket of large pharmaceutical companies. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been our family doctor for more than 15 years and all his diagnostics and treatments have been accurate. He always gives us advises and we feel that he cares about our well being.
0.600000	Sometimes doctors recommend certain medications because they get a percentage of the revenue and I dont like it because they could probably recommend something cheaper to you but they just want to make money
0.800000	I have a few doctors I see regularly. They are all very dependable, capable, and intelligent. I don't see any reason not to trust them.
0.680000	I had a LEEP procedure twice last year. I trust my doctor because She is professional and I am not. However, after having first procedure, She recommended me to have another procedure even though my after procedure result was negative. According to her, Just make sure all bad tissue is taken away by taking bigger portion . So, I followed her recommendation because she is very careful person, but on the other hand, I feel having second procedure is really needed or not.
0.520000	Do not think they give you a lot to pick from as they get a kick back for the drugs the prescribe. Would get at least 3 different opinions before I would make a decision.
1.000000	My doctor is excellent.  He never makes me feel rushed and he always takes the time to answer questions for me.  He is extremely thorough when I have to see him about something.  He also has a very human quality about him, unlike many doctors I have dealt with in the past.  He also sees my young daughter and is extremely thoughtful and thorough, more so when dealing with a youngster.
0.440000	When I offer another doctors opinion he immediately tells me they are wrong without explanation. He prescribes medications like they are candy. He gets very angry and impatient with questions or not understanding. He refuses to hear the issues I am there to see him for in full. I am cut off and he starts a physical exam instead of hearing me out. 
1.000000	My doctor I have know for almost 20 years, he is always been friendly and trusting and I have never once had an issue with my care. He always has been honest and helped me through anything I have come across. He always makes me feel like I am a priority.
0.480000	The Primary Care physician I saw for 12 years moved too far away for me to see him regularly or when I'm sick.  I changed to someone in the same group but closer geographically. It's a totally bad fit!  He goes by the numbers and doesn't really listen to what's going on with me like symptoms, etc.  He refers me to specialists for health care problems he should be able to manage.  He is very quick to write prescriptions for problems that require more examination and assessment. The practice wants patients to use a patient portal to message doctors.  He answers my questions in very short, often, one word answers. I'm already shopping for a new primary care physician.   
0.760000	My husband and I have the same doctor.  She always does and suggests many solutions to any problem we are experiencing.  The always trouble shoots are issues, and suggest tests.  I feel that she genuinely cares about her patients.
0.720000	I've known and had them my whole life and things they've done for me before have been successful so i have reason to believe they will continue to be
0.400000	I mentioned my extreme anxiety and how i just couldn't relax no matter what I tried. She told me that I just needed to walk out in the sun everyday and completely cut out caffeine and I'll be cured. She did blood work for my hypothyroidism and did a cholesterol test with it. The test came back I had high cholesterol and she put me on a medication they just called into the pharmacy and she didn't talk to me about anything. Just told me to take the pill.
0.800000	I for the most part trust my primary care physician. They always seem to give me the best information and always give me the correct treatment for my illnesses. 
0.680000	Sometimes for the same symptoms different specialist give way different, sometimes opposite prognosis, so there are many things they disagree with one another in, that makes me nervous.
0.600000	I don't totally trust my primary care physician mostly because I don't know him well enough. He took over when my long time primary care physician retired. What I do know of him is that he is nice enough but always in a hurry and I swear he just looks at his computer and checks off what blood tests I need. If he touches me physically at all it is to listen with his stethoscope and to feel my neck. That's it. Not that I want him to examine every part of me every time, but maybe a bit more thoroughness and a human touch? It's a good thing I'm proactive because if I didn't mention and point out specific problems that should be obvious to a trained physician, I don't think he'd notice.
0.680000	I generally trust him, but I don't completely trust everything they evaluate. He is just a person with his own biases after all. but I generally think of him as credible
0.680000	My doctor is very straight forward and honest but he's not rude about how he explains things to you. He always explains situations to the best he can so that you understand what needs to be done. 
0.720000	I've only had one bad doctor in all my experiences with medical professionals. And he was an eye doctor with his own private practice that strung me along, to get me to keep taking many tests. I ended up seeing optometrists at the mall (eye glasses store) and she fixed my problem after one appointment. So now I rather go to a popular and well-known location to see a doctor, if it isn't a clinic or hospital. 
0.800000	He asks me questions about myself and my family with genuine interests. He asks me my opinion and explains things to me without me asking. His team seems knowledgeable and coordinated. I feel like more than a number or source of income.
0.840000	I trust my doctor I have been going to him for about 10 years if he has any doubt about what is wrong he refers me to a specialist. 
0.680000	I mostly trust my primary care physician, because I have been seeing this doctor consistently, and I haven't croaked yet.  For the most part, I believe this doctor has my best interests at heart.  However, as a general rule, I do not trust anyone completely.
0.400000	I have had plenty of experiences with doctors where they don't even seem to exam whatever concern you have, they just brush it off or prescribe something so that they can get on with their day. Rather than really looking into something, i think they'd rather just treat everything as if its routine even if it isn't. Add on the fact that I can walk into a doctor's office and see a cutout of a pharmaceutical that they are being paid to push and it makes me feel like they're here to be salesmen instead of helping.
0.760000	I trust my doctor, although sometimes I feel patient care is just a revolving door to them. They see thousands and thousands every year, day an day out. Sometimes it is hard to get them to call you back or even schedule an appointment that has to be months away. I have seen a lot more younger doctors over the years that have more energy and stamina to take on new patients than the doctors that have been around for decades. There needs to be a change in primary care.
0.680000	I am cautiously trusting of my doctor's care for me, following up with questions if there are areas I feel she has not covered or been as thorough as needed. 
0.960000	I trust my physician completely. I have been sing the same doctor for many years. He knows were I stand with taking non nonessential medications, and antibiotics. I believe he respects that. He has never steered me wrong before. I have also never had any health issues other than an occasional cold. I also believe that a good education in the medical field is also a must have. My doctor has taken many courses and is very well rounded. He has a great amount of experience.  
0.520000	Well sometimes i feel as if my doctor doesn't take the time to really look at me i know they are in a hurry but they could spend just a little more time
0.840000	I haven't had too many experiences with doctors, let alone bad experiences. I trust doctors for the most part and tend to take whatever medicine they provide me with. But if that medicine isn't working, I'll start to doubt my doctor.
0.360000	I don't currently have a primary care physician because I switched insurance providers and still need to select one.  Basically, I've seen too many things go wrong with friends and relatives' doctors, and I'm pretty paranoid about doctors in general. I inherently don't trust them and want to avoid them. Also, I think I have a form of hypochondria where I'm always afraid of something being wrong and so just want to avoid it.
0.440000	I've had family members with doctors who have rushed them thru things, misdiagnosed or allowed very serious illnesses to remain undiagnosed, and not been careful enough in prescribing and monitoring the effect of medications. There are good doctors but I think in the US nowadays if you want to be assured you're getting the best care possible from your physician then you must be vigilant and persistent. I would be wary of any doctor even tho I know most don't mean to cause harm.
0.800000	My doctor is generally aware of my needs and the needs of my family. I always feel a level of personal care and attention when  I am in her office
0.400000	I've had a really devastating loss because my doctor suck. Or it's all my fault, and my body is just terrible. I really don't want to think about it, honestly.
0.800000	My PCP has been treating me a long time and has went out of her way to help me with new treatments and with exploring different treatment plans when traditional ones weren't working. She would also visit me during hospitalizations which has given me a lot of reasons to trust her and feel she is looking out for me. 
0.760000	I believe my doctor as well as the majority of doctors do keep my best interest in mind. To be in such a field shows and proves that they care about people's well being in general. I feel it is more of the patient who do not follow through with doing what is right for them
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she listens carefully to me, asks appropriate questions and does not dismiss my concerns.  She takes the time to get all pertinent information and thinks about my particular case before diagnosing or prescribing anything.
0.800000	I do not have a primary care physician.  I do feel that the majority of doctors are going to try their best to do what is in the best interest of their patients. 
0.440000	I was misdiagnosed with a condition for years and doctors refused to test for it. I have encountered many doctors and some understand more than others.
0.640000	I work in the medical field and I understand the way that pcps interact with their patients. Sometimes admin gets in the way of getting things done and this can impede the patient process, sometimes doctors are burnt out and are sacrificing patient outcomes for their own gains.
0.840000	She spends a good deal of time with me during my appointments.  I never feel rushed, and she appears to genuinely listen when I ask her a question.  I'm also able to carry on a constructive dialogue with her, where I share my own opinions.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they do not make me feel dumb about the questions I ask and are always willing to answer more questions I have.
0.720000	"For the most part I do trust my Dr, but at times I feel like she is rushed. Last time I was there I had told her that I had hurt my back and my chiropractor did a MRI and I found out I had degenerative disc disease. I asked her if she had someone she would refer me to if I needed injections. She acted like it wasn't a big deal and said ""ya, we dot that all the time."" I guess I would have felt better if she had asked to obtain a copy of the MRI (or look to see if she had it, as I gave her name when it was done) and look at the extent of damage and give me some names. I also feel like she doesn't look at previous issues and see if I have had any symptoms relating to those. "
0.640000	I trsut my primary care doctor for the most part. However, i do feel as though they rush me out and dont take as much time as necessary.
0.800000	I have full trust in my PCP. I have never in all the years I have been seeing her had one issue. She always makes me feel comfortable and answers all questions and concerns I have. She doesn't always take drastic measures but takes things slow to get to a solution. 
0.320000	Doctors in general are pretty untrustworthy I think. I think part of my reasoning for that comes from knowing that they push samples on people for their own profit and that they're really overworked and don't have time to really hear you. I saw a video recently about a bunch of people who saw multiple doctors and every doctor was brushing them aside and saying it was nothing when really it was ovarian cysts and split nerves and doctors just didn't take the time to care. So I think I've always felt this way but that recent video kinda watered the seed that was already planted in my head so to speak. 
1.000000	They haven't let me down yet. I trust them because every time i went to them with a problem, they always took care of it. They always manage to give me what i need to fix my problem without any negative side effects
0.600000	Again, it comes down to the fact that people can lie.  People on this planet have an ultimate goal in mind and that is to make money.  So, if a doctor is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and are essentially drug dealers, how could you trust that person ever?
0.640000	It it their job and I like to believe they have moral standards and wouldnt sway me towards something wrong.
0.400000	For the most part, I do trust my primary care physician.  I believe the physician has my best interest overall.  That being said, I still question my doctor on certain decisions to make sure I agree with the decision.  I am not afraid to question my doctor or do more research about certain decisions my doctor wants me to follow.
0.560000	My primary care physician is kind and he listens but I feel he is often in a hurry and hears my words but only the ones that he wants to. He wants to order more test on top of more tests and sends me to other doctors that I can not afford even after I express to him that I do not have the finances to go to others. 
0.640000	The medical field in my observation us more focused on insurance and getting paid well rather than helping people. It is all about how much money the medical field can get and with insurance how much the insurances can save on patients.
1.000000	My doctor is a very down to earth person. I think that he and I have a lot in common. We are able to talk freely with him and have agreed on almost everything that we have every talked about. The decisions that he has made thus far I have agreed with and would anticipate that he would continue to make decisions in the future that I agree with.
0.960000	I found from my past experiences that my primary care physician treatment opinions are best for my good health. As the result I have full trust in my primary care physician.
0.440000	My doctor usually rushes through, spends bare minimal time with me.  He makes me feel like I don't know my own body. He usually tries to push his opinions on me. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because so far she has not given me any reason not to trust her. She has really good online reviews and so far my experiences with her have been pleasant.
1.000000	I have gone to the same doctor my entire life. He has been my family's doctor for many years. My family and I trust him completely. He has always been very honest and has always taken the time to answer all my questions.
0.760000	I agree for the most part that doctors are looking out for their patients and can be trusted, but I do think like all human beings sometimes they are working in their own interests.  For example, my regular doctor used to recommend removing moles even if they are not a problem (cancerous or pre-cancerous), but when I mentioned that I am on high deductible insurance and these procedures come out of my pocket, she conceded that this mole removal is not needed.
0.960000	My Primary Care physician is incredible. She's relatable and kind and takes the time to address any concerns I have. I trust her completely.
0.760000	I trust that most doctors truly have their patient's well being in mind when they recommend courses of action. Most doctors that I have seen have been very open with me about my treatment options and about finding what is affordable for me at the time.
0.920000	I trust my primary care because I have to be able to rely on them to help me make informed medical decisions.  I also need to be able to trust my doctor to explain to me the best course of action.
0.400000	I distrust my doctor because I feel that I'm just a check to them. I sometimes leave feeling that nothing had been accomplished by my visit and that my suggested treatment was the most convenient for them. I've also been misdiagnosed at least once to my knowledge.
0.760000	When I had serious medical complications, my doctor sent me to a specialist rather than trying to deal with the situation himself. I feel confident that he actually cares about my well-being.
0.760000	I have had the same doctor for 15 years, and he has never steered me wrong yet.  He always treated my grandma and continuously worked to help her as she had dementia and Alzheimer.
0.680000	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor and that was more about billing and paperwork than the actual care. When a doctor gives me an opinion I generally accept it and follow their advice. So far in life that has not let me down.
0.600000	"I haven't seen a doctor in over a year; I had to have stitches in my arm due to an accident. I'll use that experience to explain here. The doctor I saw was very trustworthy, in my view. The first thing he did when he saw me - before he even said a word to me - was put on gloves and poke/prod a lipoma near my eye. I had seen my doctor about it years previous so I knew it wasn't anything to be concerned with, but having a doctor who goes ""hey, this guy is here for stitches.. but I'm going to take a brief moment and check out this other thing that I'm not even going to put on the record"" really made me feel as if he was looking out for me. I really appreciated that. When we got to looking at my arm, he explained how I was lucky because if the cut had been just a small amount deeper I'd need surgery (of course today I couldn't use the terminology that he did, but at the time I fully understood everything he was saying -- if you're a redditor, it was very ELI5). However, when speaking with my normal doctors.. sometimes it seemed as if they weren't really paying attention to what I was saying. For example, when I was in the military I told my primary care physician that it didn't matter what time I would lay down, I could not go to sleep. His response to me was ""go to bed earlier"". He eventually sent me to see the base psych and I was given medications that helped."
0.760000	I have had bad experiences in the past with doctors and i have learned what to look out for when it comes to bad care.
0.600000	I generally trust my doctor but I feel like with the workload they have that sometimes I need to be responsible in following through or asking the right questions in order to make sure I get the right help.
0.800000	there have been times in the past I thought the doctor was not taking my high cholesterol as serious as they should.  However,  I changed my diet and worked out and brought  my level down without medicine so I am glad I did not rely on the drugs. 
0.520000	I never fully trust a doctor because I know they are just human beings. As a lawyer, I understand that there are many people who can go through medical school and come out under-qualified.
0.600000	I do think doctors have a lot of pressure to get one patient done and move onto the next; hence lapses in high quality service.  My doctor is careful, but could probable be a little more detailed.  Also, I can do research on my own to determine what medication I need and know my medical history well enough to know what medication doesn't work well or causes a reaction.  
0.360000	I trust my PCP and one other doctor. Following that, I usually trust male docs I donât know if he doesnât jump into the examination and gives me time to feel him out. Talks a bit, etc. I canât trust women doctors. :( (Personal history). To be fair, I donât have a feeling that most are not in it for the right reason, not as a business venue.
0.800000	I don't see my PCP often, but when I do he is very straightforward with me. He expresses his concerns if he has any. He then gives a list of options for treatment(s) and allows me to decide which course to follow. If there are any issues I have a variety of ways in which I can reach out to him and he is prompt at responding.
0.400000	I feel like the physician is more oriented towards actions that would bring the hospital more revenues and comfort.  The physician does not seem to truly listen to all that I have to say and makes judgments and diagnoses before fully understanding the problems.
0.800000	I have not had a reason not to  trust him, everything he has recommended thus far has been accurate with no reason to question his decisions.  
0.600000	I feel I haven't seen my newest Dr. enough to have complete trust in them. They do give me my options and seem knowledgeable in what they are doing. I do however always have some worries as to if sometimes they are just being paid by some drug companies to give certain meds out or prescribe certain treatments.
0.800000	My doctor has known me since I was young and knows my entire medical history. He always takes the time to go over my symptoms and questions with me.
0.880000	I fully trust my PCP because I feel that she is open and allows me to play a large role in my own healthcare. When I discuss my health with her, it is very natural and not uncomfortable. She allows me to make decisions together with her and she always listens to my concerns and opinions.
0.360000	I feel like my doctor is in a hurry. She is wanting to get through with the exam and move on to the next patient. If I ask a question, she rushes through the answer. I can always tell she is focused on getting to the next person. So I don't necessarily trust her to be thorough or careful.
0.920000	I have never personally had an experience with a doctor that would make me not trust a doctor's advise.  I believe that in general doctors do have their patients best interest in mind. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor, all in all i have gotten what i needed from him. He's always been right about my health and given me the right medication. The only thing is that he's always in a rush wished he would spend a little more time answering my questions.
0.800000	I do feel at ease with my doctor. I have known her for many years so she knows how my body reacts to things. How I feel about things. I believe in her judgement. 
0.640000	I trust my primary physician because he is honest with me and tries to help me as much as he can. I also get to freely engage him when i have a problem
0.800000	I trust them for the most part because they know what they're doing and generally want me to get better. The only thing I dont trust about my doctor is the brands of prescription medicine they push because I know some medication gives them bonuses while others don't so I have to research the medications myself to see which is right for me
0.440000	For the last several years I have primarily seen a pain management specialist.  I feel like it has been write a prescription rather than deal with the problems. Then when the attitudes began to change about medicating chronic pain patients it became trying to stop giving me medication. At no time have I felt my best interests were served.  I would prefer a more middle of the road approach. 
0.640000	well sometimes its hard to trust on your primary care physician because they cant guarantee your health back and even other doctors wont  take responsibility they can just try their best to take care of a person
0.480000	I want to have full trust in my primary doctor but I feel like some training is outdated.  I feel that pharmaceutical companies influence doctors greatly.  I've experienced a situation where I was not given all my options and I feel surgery was recommended and pushed to make money.  I feel like it's too much about making money and less about making people healthy.  Especially considering the fact that Americans are growing more and more unhealthy - kids and adults alike.
0.840000	I have known this person for a few years now, and I trust his judgement. I have felt that he is interested me as a person, not just a chart. I feel I could talk to this person about anything going on in my body.
0.600000	My doctor recently left her practice so I will be seeing a new doctor. In addition, I always feel that a doctor is trying to get through as many patients as possible. 
0.560000	Many doctors are too busy to listen to their patients. Some have a horrible bedside manner and it makes the patients feel uncomfortable to ask important questions. If a doctor is to be trusted, they need to listen to the patient. They need to show compassion and understanding, while maintaining a professional demeanor.
0.600000	I have the utmost trust in the group of  nurse midwives that I see for my primary gynecological care and for the birth of my son.  I believe their values perfectly align with my own and I trust them implicitly with medical decisions.  I trust most doctors less.
0.720000	I recently moved and do not have a primary care physician. I think doctors in general have the patient's best interest in mind. I have enjoyed working with most of my doctors, but I have occasionally felt rushed during appointments. Therefore, there has been occasional distrust.
0.720000	I would definitely trust my health care physician because they are the people I could ask help whenever I feel sick. My health care physician was the reason why i am still standing in this planet. I have a good relationships with her and also to my family since when I was young.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I have read reviews about him. I also trust him because I myself have checked up on the internet the treatment and procedures that he has suggested or prescribed. 
0.480000	"Generally speaking, doctors are a product of their systems and culture. They often see themselves as godlike figures, incapable of being questioned, and the environments where they work, with their constant reverence for doctors, reinforce that mentality. This, combined with their fear of liability often makes them completely averse to anything new or different, even when the literature and research show that there is significant potential benefit. I feel that more doctors are concerned about ""not rocking the boat"" than doing what is best for the patient. There are, of course, stellar exceptions, and I have been fortunate to work with some of them.   "
0.880000	My doctor talks to me like a friend instead of a patient. If he needs to prescribe a medicine, he talks to me on my level of understanding about the pros and cons and tells me about his success or lack thereof with his other patients. He is very honest and open about what I do and do not need to change in reference to my lifestyle. Most importantly, if he doesn't have an answer, he is not afraid to tell me he doesn't know and needs to refer me to a specialist. That most of all is why I trust him so much - that he is willing to admit he doesn't know something or admit someone else may have a better solution.
0.600000	I feel like my doctors are trustworthy for the most part but sometimes I wonder if they get paid by people like drug companies to give out certain kinds of medicine for people who have problems and maybe that makes them find problems that aren't there sometimes. 
0.600000	I do generally trust my doctor, but I know there's a lot he doesn't know, and the same goes for most doctors. So I always supplement whatever information/recommendations he gives me with additional research to get a bigger picture. Doctors generally overprescribe medication, which usually has side effects and can do more harm than good in the long run, so I want to know exactly what I'll get into if I make a certain choice.
0.800000	I've known my primary care physician most of my life, and he has never given me a reason not to trust him. 
0.760000	I find that my PCP has a genuine interest to see that I am as healthy as I can be.  She listens to my problems and seems to expend the appropriate amount of concern and energy into solving my problems.  She will also freely give prescriptions or referrals when I need to see a specialist.
0.800000	I been seeing my doctor for several years.  He has always been helpful and profession when my family or I are sick.
0.840000	I trusted my former primary care physician, but I didn't put all of my trust in him. God is first in my life and my trust is in Him, but to a certain degree I trusted my former primary care physician, because he always seemed to be honest in telling me about all different treatment options available and the results of my blood tests. 
0.720000	I pretty much trust my primary care doctor. She is friendly and easy to talk to. Sometimes I do feel like she is a little preoccupied with other things and in a hurry. But over all I think I receive adequate care from her.  
0.240000	The primary care physicians are going to spend as little time with patients as possible.  They are busy and dont have time to explain everything or care about every patient.  If the doctor prescribes me a drug or suggests a certain treatment I will do thorough research on my own time and make my own decision about my course of treatment.
0.320000	The few times I have visited the doctor I have felt a sense of urgency from them as if they were too busy for my time. I also feel like they do not care as much as they should, too many times have I experienced a doctor telling me a bunch of information at once like they were a robot, not making any eye contact with me through the lecture. 
0.840000	I have along history with my doctor and I know now i can trust him on what he says and I am always the one to ask questions and at time confirm what he says by reading more on the subject
0.680000	I get a new doctor each time so it's hard to build trust. They don't necessarily know my medical history so it's hard to trust them.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she is very understanding and knows me really well. She is almost like my friend and is really nice to me.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he tells me exactly what I have, why I have what I have, and how to correct my condition. He does not try to push medications on me but looks for natural solutions if possible. 
0.880000	I feel like I have to trust him.  I am allowing him to look after my health.  If I didn't trust that his decisions or education was good enough I would happily find a new doctor.
0.800000	I trust her because she actually takes the time out to listen to me when I speak to her about what is going on with me.
0.960000	I have been around physicians all my life. Iâve volunteered in hospitals, worked in hospitals, job-shadowed various doctors, and have numerous doctors as colleagues (Iâm in medical school). I have a primary care physician and whenever I have a checkup etc. with my own knowledge I know he tells me the truth and shows a caring side, and answers all my questions. Trust is earned, and I believe (since I am doing it), with all the education doctors go through, trust should be there, because it is a respected occupation. 
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician, therefore I marked all of the above items as neutral. I've personally been friends with several doctors in my life, and the reality is they are people like everyone else, and as a result my trust in them depends on their ethics and character. Some doctors are very caring and insightful, some are full of ego that blinds them truly looking and understanding a case before them. And all degrees in between. Should I ever need to see a doctor, I will to a great deal of research on them before consenting to be their patient.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him since I was a kid and he has been truthful and honest ever since. He has also been my family's primary care physician.
0.320000	I don't have much trust in my former mainstream (allopathic) doctor mainly because of the way information in allopathic medicine is taught, from a top down and 'condition-osis' perspective.  There is no such thing in mainstream medicine as understanding a situation from the ground up.  Instead, a description of a condition is projected onto the patient and care is given based on that projection.  My doctor did absolutely nothing for me in regards to my scoliosis that got so bad my entire rib cage began to slip out of place.  Instead of seeing what was there, he acted on the preconceived notion of what scoliosis was and the problems it can cause.
0.760000	I trust them to do their jobs. I have confidence in them unless they give me a reason not to. I believe they have their patient's best interesting in mind. 
0.800000	I have complete faith in my doctor's abilities and believe that my well-being is at the top of their interests. I feel there is no reason to mistrust my doctor.
0.800000	One of the reasons I distrust a lot of Physicians is because in this day, I fear, mostly they are after money. So more test's, more this, more that, try this try that, I fear its all about the money. I wish it wasn't so. But mostly I feel this way. But not about everyone.
0.200000	I distrust my PCP and the conventional medical doctors because they are only trained in drugs and surgery.  It is a big business and no one is allowed to deviate from it even if the results are in the best interest of the patient. You look around and see so many people sick, how can I trust the doctors?  Doctors still think soda is ok to drink!
0.720000	I generally trust doctors, but I don't believe you should trust anyone 100%, without at least verifying their information with another expert at least once or twice, every so often.
0.640000	i trust doctors for the most part because i believe many of them are inherently good people who got into the medical field in order to help be of service to others. Occasionally there are doctors who seem to be pretty detached from their work and just see all their patients as a paycheck, and that is truly an awful thing.
0.800000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because of his personality and willingness to answer any questions I would have. His explanation for his methods or recommendations are pretty reasonable and sound and he never rushes me through an appointment. 
0.640000	I have been recently assigned a new provider. As far as I can tell, he is a very competent doctor. He has been very helpful in my medications and I have not experienced any problems under this current provider.
0.920000	I have had my primary physician for 20 plus years. During that time he has always listened to my concerns, shared his concerns and always made the correction decisions to improve my various health issues. He is kind and considerate and truly cares about mew and his other patients
0.880000	My doctor listens to me and spends a good amount of time with me instead of just rushing along the appointment. She always asks me if I have any questions and addresses every one of them if I do. When I call the office for a need, I always get assistance over the phone in a timely manner.
0.800000	I do not go very often to a doctor, but I have the same family doctor since I was quite young, and I believe he has always done a good job helping me to maintain good health, and warning me of risks and dangers posed by my behaviors.
0.720000	i see a nurse practitioner which was new for me. i think it's a red state thing. or maybe it's the future. anyway the practitioner was able to refer me to a specialist
0.720000	It's not my primary care physician in particular that I distrust, It's the fact that doctors are people too and anybody can get lazy and careless at times in their profession or simply be having a bad day. I mildly mistrust all doctors until I have reasonable proof not to do so. There are problems with how the medical field is run in this country and I'm sure there are doctors out there that disgree with things they must comply to on a daily basis which can be disheartening in the longrun. Most doctors have the ability to be great, but I believe it's harder than it has to be. Overall though, I do trust my doctor because I have faith in the decision I made to choose them as my pcp based on my experience with them. 
0.440000	Often feel rushed or forgotten by my doctor's office. It's packed and I have a hard time getting anyone on the phone or talking to busy staff while I'm there. I ferl like one in hundreds of patients they see in a week. I wait for literal hours for my appointments and spend maybe 30 minutes being seen.
0.520000	I've worked in healthcare (previously) for over 15 years, and have had first-hand experience with many doctors.  I've seen a side of doctors that patients don't see, and some of these interactions have fostered a lack of trust.  I've had experiences where I've gone to see a new doctor and they've had a prescription written for me before I even spoke to them.  I've seen my husband prescribed contraindicated medications that caused an adverse reaction that even I knew shouldn't be taken together.  But, alternatively, I've had some doctors who treated me well who I've really trusted.  I've known other doctors to go out of their way to cater to their patient's needs/fears/wishes.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to talk to me about all aspects of my health, and helps me look into a multitude of treatment options, where applicable. He is very experienced, and takes the time to listen to me (which can be rare in doctors). I get the feeling that my family's and my own health are important to him.
0.880000	I had the same doctor for the last 12 years. He has always taken good care of me. I think of him more like a family friend than just my primary care doctor. When I had lower back pain problem and couldn't sleep, he referred me to a really good chiropractor and physical therapist. I put a lot of trust in his diagnostic and advice because he is almost always correct with his assessment.   
0.800000	My primary care person is a local Nurse Practitioner.  She is busy but never seems rushed while visiting with me about my concerns.  She listens and then asks questions to be sure she understands.  She explains the reason she will chose a certain treatment or why she's choosing to wait and see rather than treat right away.  I like that she doesn't talk down to me and treats me as though I am intelligent enough to understand.
0.880000	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor, and it was because he went against my wishes. Other than that one experience, my normal doctor listens to me completely, and always has insightful advice or resources for me to utilize.
0.320000	 As a poor citizen of the United States I like millions of my fellow countryman probably avoid seeing doctors as much as possible. The cost of health care is insane and the treatment that is given to lower class individuals is often not very good. I can say this from first hand experience as told in my previous statement. Doctors often seem to care more about money than about the ethical side of their profession which is to help people. I feel there is a large disconnect between healthcare needs and healthcare providers in this country. Doctors taking hand outs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe their drugs is a huge conflict of interests. Healthcare should not be a for profit business but rather a human right. Until this concept is realized in this country and in the rest of the world who is falling behind the general public will continue to not trust doctors and not seek medical help. Going into crippling debt for simply seeing a doctor is not an option for most people.
0.760000	My primary doctor is my OBGYN and she is amazing. She listens to my concerns and takes them seriously. Whereas other doctors would gloss over my anxieties/fears, she will go the extra mile to make sure I am well taken care of, even if that means transferring my care to someone else.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have seen the same one for twenty years. He has always been very thorough for regarding any issue that I have. During my pregnancies he was never too pushy about what he thought was best, and let me make the decisions. He is always a good listener when it comes to my concerns, and never rushes me out of his office. 
0.760000	my doctor has been very open and honest with me about my health and the things i should be doing and avoiding. she does not sugar coat anything but she is also compassionate when relating her message across to me which makes me feel more comfortable and apt to listening to her medical advice.
0.560000	Sometimes it seems like he is pushing pharmaceutical trials on me. He does not always seem genuinely interested in my welfare, although we make small talk often.
0.480000	I trust them as much as I should. What that means is if they are clearly pushing a prescription for something I don't think I need, I distrust them. If they are actively pushing minimal treatment I trust them more because I think that my health is their priority opposed to making money by seeing me over and over again or by prescribing more drugs.
0.520000	sometimes people have other things on their mind.  they see a lot of patients and might not be feeling good that day. they might not be as informed on new things out in the medical field. they may have been last in their class. there are many things that  can cause mistakes to be made. they are only human also
0.720000	I do feel that if I go to my doctor they will give me the best medical attention as possible but I am also aware of natural way of healing that can also be applied.  The natural way are never mentioned by my doctor.  Because of side effects of medications I will often try a natural way of healing first followed by a medication only if absolutely nessesary. I often feel that side effects are overlooked and not discussed. 
0.800000	I trust doctors because they have the most knowledge on what is best for my condition. There is so much conflicting information that a healthcare professional is the only source of an effective care solution. If I want to recover as quickly as possible then following doctors orders is the best method.
0.600000	I'm not entirely happy with my primary care physician because he doesn't always take the time I would like him to take with me.  It is a busy practice. I am currently looking for a new doctor who will be willing to spend time answering my questions.  A doctor who will listen to me and not just assume I don't know what i'm talking about when it comes to my health.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she will explain all options to me and also make sure that she understands who I am as her patient. She also makes sure that her staff is also aware of who I am as a patient. 
0.560000	I try to ask questions to get the best information, but am not always sure that I have done so. My primary care physician and doctors in general tend to rush appointments and have subordinates reply to me with answers that are sometimes inadequate. My trust is therefore about 50-50.
0.880000	"I trust my medical professional because from the moment I met her, she engaged me and made me feel comfortable and relaxed.  Throughout my visits with her, I've seen her competency shine through and appreciate her honesty and her ""house tricks"" to treat more common/household illnesses.  While she may prescribe a medication, she'll also talk through other alternatives and recommendations."
0.520000	I always feel so rushed during consultations that I feel distrustful of his advice.  Can he really be that careful with my care in fifteen minutes?
0.800000	My doctor takes the time to actively listen to me and to address my concerns. I don't feel like a number or like I'm being rushed. He takes the time to explain things to me in a way I understand and is empathetic to what I say.
0.680000	I have only been to this doctor for 2 physicals and I have not had any serious problems so it is hard to judge whether I trust her completely. She seems nice enough and she doesn't force me to do things that I disagree with her about so she seems okay. For instance I have osteoporosis and I have found a very good supplement which is used to treat osteoporosis in Japan and the doctor wanted me to take prescription meds and I refused because of the side effects. She allowed me to go the course I prefer at my own risk. We will see what will happen when the stakes are higher as far as having a more serious health problem ( which I hope does not happen any time soon). 
0.800000	I like my doctor, we have a private practice doctor, so I feel we get lucky and get extra time he doesn't seem to rush me and I feel he listens to me when I go in to see him.  I also like that I see only him, so he can look back from last time he saw me or review his notes, that gives me confidence that something won't be missed
1.000000	I trust her because she seems so genuine and caring. She is very thorough when giving me information and very knowledgeable. We have a lot in common and I can really relate to her. 
0.840000	My primary care physician has been efficient but thorough the last two years that I've been seeing her. She listens to my concerns, offers treatment options, and describes pros/cons of available options. Her manner is very pleasant and she balances speaking in vernacular terms and medical terms so as to neither come across as confusing or patronizing. 
0.440000	I don't always trust everything the doctor says and seem to spend more time talking to the nurse asking questions. The doctors seem to think they know everything and don't ask many questions. I't understandable they seem pressed for time as I can understand why that would be true. I do think that is the main reson for a lack of trust though it may not always be true.
0.800000	It took me a while to get to a point where I felt okay with this doctor; my previous doctor died and I switched to the current doctor, who was in the same practice, and we clashed at first. But now we understand each other better. Also, I got treated for my trypanophobia (fear of medical needles) and since then I am better able to trust doctors in general.
0.840000	She has always listened to what problems I am having.  She runs the tests necessary to diagnose my medical conditions and my general health.  She changes medications when needed to better treat my issues.  She seems to genuinely care about my health and well being.
0.680000	My current physician is relatively new to me, so these questions are a bit difficult to answer. Overall, I feel my doctor has been very sympathetic and has taken my concerns seriously. She has ordered appropriate diagnostics and I feel that she has spent an appropriate amount of time asking follow-up questions. In my experience over the past decade, I have noticed many doctors spending less time with patients. I think the doctor/patient relationship, in general, suffers due to insurance regulations and company policies.
0.760000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. she is very attentive, always listens. So far all of her recommendations were spot on.
0.360000	Doctors are busy and use mental shortcuts.  There is a large body of literature showing this.  Doctors are also generally very busy and shocking self-important, with little experience in the humility that actual scientists have.
0.640000	The doctors who I know personally genuinely do care.So while sometimes it is a situation of covering their butts, most the time it is done for my welfare. 
0.760000	I'm very frank and open with her and she is with me, which is what I would expect and this makes me feel safe.  She asks tough questions and doesn't beat around the bush, gets to the point, and is very directive in what she believes is best for me.  I like this about her and am totally open with her.
0.600000	I have had a lot of bad experiences with doctors. I currently have a nurse practitioner that I like and trust. My experience began young when I had a doctor tell me on several occasions that I couldn't have whatever disorder I came to see him for. Such as telling me a thirteen year old can't have ulcers (I did). Once I had a doctor put me out of work for seven days for whooping cough as an adult, and when j explained to her I needed one more day to not get in trouble at work so I'd be on sick leave she denied it. There are other instances where I felt my voice wasn't heard. 
0.720000	My primary care physician sometimes seems to be in a hurry on days when he has a lot of patients to see, so he does not ask me many questions on those days. If I have any symptoms that are bothering me, then I would have to make sure to point them out to him myself when he is in a hurry. He always prescribes treatment or orders tests to learn what is wrong, so he can prescribe accurate medicines.
0.800000	He's been a osteopathic physician for many years and takes the time to listen to my concerns and suggest options for treatment.  He's open-minded and not the least bit dismissive.  His judgment is sound and his demeanor is caring. 
1.000000	My group of doctors work together to get me the care needed. They toss ideas around with each other so there is always a second and third opinion before we move forward with anything in the event that I do get sick.
0.600000	I trust that my primary care physician is knowledgeable but sometimes wonder if she has ulterior motives when she is always trying to push medications on me which I do not think I need. 
0.800000	I do trust doctors in general but it's hard to find a doctor who truly cares. For example, I used to go to the doctor and I always felt rushed because he had million patients waiting in the waiting area. He is a good doctor but I like when I have enough time to tell about my problems or what I feel or my concerns and he just didn't really have time to listen. I found another doctor who is amazing. He has a small office and not a lot of patience because he really takes his time and really cares. You can call him on his personal phone number and he will answer and will try to help
0.400000	Doctors are after the bottom line for the most part, which that is how many patients can I see in a day and how much money can I make off them. My doctor is sort of that way and I don't like having to wait hours for just 5 minutes of his time. It takes longer than that to diagnose someone and help them through that situation
0.800000	I believe my doctor is qualified to make decisions about my medical care. They are more informed and knowledgable about healthcare than I am.
0.600000	I have a lack of trust with physicians when they seem to be completely distant from me when I am giving them information or explaining my situation. It boils down to them having a lack of social skills - I often feel like when I am being shooed out of an office to get me out as soon as possible, it feels as though I am not worth their time. Again, this often happens when I am at an urgent care clinic or with doctors that I am seeing for the very first time. Also, a lack of professionalism shows me that they could potentially be wrong about a prescription. 
0.560000	I trust her because she is a licensed doctor and looking out for what is best for me. If my physician wasn't trustworthy, i'm sure they would've stripped her of license to practice medicine.
0.800000	I have always had a good experience with her and she seems willing to answer questions and explain things. For the most part I trust her. She seems very intelligent and like she thinks before she speaks.
0.840000	He seems to know what he is doing and knows the technical terminology when we discuss my problems. He seems to have empathy as well.
0.800000	My Dr. has always though about my good health, sometimes more than me. He declined to do a procedure because I just had it done lass the a month before and he was afraid it might cause me more discomfort.
0.440000	Like i previously stated i feel that physicians dont listen or care about me but only the masses and fixing a large number of people and not specifically me. So personally i feel alone and afraid because i am the only one interested in my health and well being.
0.560000	I don't have a primary care physician, but I've seen several doctors during the last year.  Two of them prescribed treatment which I agreed to.  One doctor did not tell until after the treatment that I would need to have surgery to have the problem corrected completely.  I would say most doctors can be trusted, but some cannot.
0.880000	She has entered in to a relationship with me with goal setting and holding me accountable, she's not just passive.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because she takes time with me. She spends more than one minute in the room with me when I go. She takes the time to not only see to my health but to ask about my personal life. She remembers me and asks me always about different things I have shared with her such as work or my personal life. 
0.400000	I don't trust my primary care physician because she is barely available and doesn't spend much time with me. She doesn't fully listen to what I have to say. Her assistants do most of the intake, if not all of it. She often seems stressed, and she probably is. Even so, I need someone to sit down and listen to me for more than three minutes. Every meeting and exam seems to only cover the bare minimum of a patient's needs.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he takes a lot time with every patient to figure out how you are and what is going on.  Willing to give all the tests needed to figure out any issues.
0.800000	I trust that my doctor is giving me all the information to the best of her ability, and wants to help me make the best decisions possible. However, she is human, and busy, and human health is complicated and constantly evolving. I do not expect her to know everything. 
0.560000	There have been times when my Dr. has overlooked things, but there have also been times when my Dr. has been very thorough. 
0.560000	They get in to mush of a hurry, it feels rushed. They will come in and start discussing what needs to be done and while I'm there I feel like I don't even talk the same language sometimes. I almost always look everything I can remember on line. It helps me figure out what is really going on. 
0.960000	My doctor is very well educated and experienced. He is warm and approachable and always tells me the plus and minuses regarding medicines and treatments I need.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she has always listened to my concerns and taken time with me,  instead of rushing through my appointments.
0.640000	For the most part I trust my doctor to monitor my health and if a problem presents help me find a reasonable solution. But I also people in human mistake and that sometimes you have to be your own health advocate.  Doctors don't always have the right answers and sometimes you have to be persistent if you feel something is not right. 
0.800000	 I trust my primary care physician for several reasons. I know he has a strong educational background and has been in practice for many years. I have researched online and read reviews on my physician and they are very good reviews. My physician has always listened to me, given me good advice and treatment and I have never not benefited from his care.He has certainly earned my trust.
0.560000	I trust them to a certain extent, but I know they are influenced by Big Pharma, and are reluctant to tell you about natural, effective treatment, and will probably try to get you on some type of prescription that you may or may not need.  In many cases these drugs can do more harm than good.
0.640000	I trust the doctor because he is experienced and deals with patients with similar problems. Since he is familiar in his field he will know how to treat me. 
0.600000	Overall, I may put trust into doctors generally since they are professionals within the field, but I suppose I have a bit of skepticism toward some doctors and their thoroughness. Also, it seems that some treatments in the past haven't been the most adequate in treating various concerns, which influences my perception.
0.760000	When it boils down, a doctor is still a human and all humans are prone to error.  I believe they are obviously more educated on health subject matter than me, but I don't necessarily put 100% trust that they know best all of the time. 
0.760000	I will go to the doctor if something is wrong and so far have never been sent wrong or given wrong advice or information
0.440000	I feel Doctor's no longer spend time engaging with their patients. It's in and out. I feel most of what's said is ignored and simply one problem is quickly looked at and guessed with what the popular treatment is at the moment.
0.200000	Well I dont feel like he uses enough wholistic techniques only knows medication. He isnt thorough enough. I feel like he looks at physical appearance and then does basic tests.
0.800000	I have been with my same doctor for years. During this time, from my impression, my doctor has always been honest and forthright with me. My doctor's actions and behavior has never given me any reason to distrust him. Therefore, until I am given a reason, I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
0.680000	I have never had any experience to make me not trust my doctor. Most of the time I think he is trying to do what is best to treat whatever is the wrong in the most effective way.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I think they are very thorough. I feel like they go through all the necessary questions to diagnose me and prescribe the right medications to help me feel better.
0.240000	all doctors care about one thing, money. they don't care about you. to them, you are a bank and they want to drain you, even if you die.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel like the doctor does not listen and treats every case or condition the same. If they have seen something like it before, or have experienced something similar before, they tend to forget that every person is an individual and may react differently to the same condition as someone else
0.720000	My physician has always been very helpful in getting me any information I need, even when I am asking a lot of questions. 
0.480000	I find most doctors I have dealt with to be very rushed. If I explain something poorly, they get the wrong idea and prescribe the wrong treatment. They don't have enough time to do good diagnosis. So I think the doctors are good people. I also think they don't have enough time to do their jobs well. Likely, they may not be as up-to-date as they need to be with medical science.
0.640000	I have some trust in my primary care physician but would hesitate to have full trust unless I have gone through many more health issues to see her response/care to them. I do tend to do independent research on the health issues so that i have some comparison to her response & care of the problem. So, mostly, i feel like she has been truthful and has provided adequate care. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor to am extent. I know he has my best interests at heart. But no doctor can keep up on all the newest medical research. So I try to supplement with my own research
0.440000	Doctors in my life have shown an air of superiority when I have been discussing issues. To the point that I have to argue why I don't want a certain treatment or medication. They can act with blinders and not even recognize it.  
0.520000	The physicians ive had generally rush through the procedures, and care little for my thoughts. I have never had a severe condition but it would worry me if i ever did
0.480000	i don't see my primary care physician too often. he's a decent guy, but i think he's more interested in sending me off for tests than anything else. he doesn't seem to know that much himself, it's always more tests.
0.760000	Since it's the doctor's job, and they are more knowledgeable in the field of health, I have to trust them, even if I think if their decision is a little questionable. I can ask them questions on why they recommend something, but they have more expertise in the field than me.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel the doctors are only going to do as much as they need to cover the basics. For instance, if a patient only have medicaid or medicare the doctors will not suggest better treatment options that are available because the health care doesn't cover it. This practice is done without regard to the patient being able to fund the treatment in another capacity. This same treatment is the opposite for those with private healthcare. 
0.880000	While I have been lucky to have great doctors whom I trust, and I trust my current doctors, I would say that I do not necessarily trust doctors in general. This is because I understand that doctors are less likely to take women's reported symptoms seriously, medications that may be prescribed are tested much less thoroughly on women than on men, and especially in obstetrics women are not given important information to monitor their own health during/after childbirth which leads to the US having an incredibly high maternal death rate for a first-world country. If I were a man, I would trust medical practices a great deal more. 
0.440000	I do get the impression that the doctor is trying to get through his visit with me as fast as possible. I understand that they need to do this to make a living, and I know the realities of insurance reimbursement and the way they are paid. Still, it means that I am suspicious of my doctor's motives and I don't really fully trust them. I know they are looking out for their interests before they are necessarily looking out for mine.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I feel he has no reason to deceive me. I give them good money to be told the truth and guided in the right direction regarding my health.
0.920000	My doctor is very trustable because he takes his time with me and cares about me getting better when im ill. I have no reason to distrust him with all he does for me. Hes the best at what he does.
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing her since I am a child and she always will go the distance to figure out what is wrong with me when it is something more than just a cold. She will order multiple test and blood labs, and always tries to explain all information with me. I am comfortable in talking with her openly and she does the best she can to keep me at ease.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is extremely careful and honest telling me about all the different treatment options all the time.
0.560000	It's hard to keep cynical thoughts out of my mind. I can't help but see them as flawed and just figuring things out like everyone else. It's hard to know if I'm communicating clearly enough for them to totally understand everything anyway.
0.800000	My Primary care physician works with a team. I feel confident that he can handle any medical situation I might have, he also consults with the team if necessary.
0.720000	I have had terrible medical experiences for the last twenty years and I finally have a great Dr who will spend hours with me if necessary and appears to actually care how I am doing. 
0.640000	I guess it is I trust my doctor to make decisions and help find answers. It is the unexplained sickness or pain that seems like all doctors avoid. You always have to see several doctors instead of just a few and that's when it seems like your being pushed through the system. If someone finds something, or another test is run.. I want to know why.. and what the findings are. Some don't let you know anything after tests are done.
0.960000	Usually my primary care physician had more experience and knowledge than me, and they know better what they give to everyone
0.400000	At the end of the day it is their job and duty to ensure that i get the help i pay for so i am generally rather trusting of them and their judgement
0.800000	He has been in the healthcare profession for quite some time and is very knowledgeable. He is well respected in the community
0.800000	My primary care physician takes the time to go through what has gone on since the last time I've seen them.  They go through all of my medications.  They do an exam and go over any and all symptoms I may be having. They thoroughly discuss any labwork that was completed and then discuss all options for changes.  I trust their opinion because they take time with me. 
0.360000	My insurance isn't great and I have to go to a very low cost doctor whom I don't have a lot of trust in, to be frank. She has often told me things that I outright knew were wrong (e.g.: continuing to tell me to take St. John's Wort after being prescribed Prozac, rinsing out a dog bite with hydrogen peroxide). It makes me wonder if the things she tells me that I DON'T know are wrong are correct.
0.880000	Good references from other people concerning his technical ability, thoroughness, genuine interest in patients.  He's also embedded in a system with lots of other support services, and uses them thoughtfully.
1.000000	Physicians have generally given me plenty of information and different options for care. They explain things when asked. I have rarely encountered physicians that are not attentive to my needs as a patient.
0.440000	Most of the time, doctors do what is easy, or less expensive. Not caring about how miserable I may be. I have met very few doctors that understand that I have lived in my body my whole life, not them.
1.000000	I've been to doctors in the past that I've questioned some of their decisions, but I'm very happy with the current doctor I see.  She is knowledgeable, well-educated and respects me as a patient.  She listens to my concerns and responds in an appropriate way.
0.760000	I have a good rapport with my personal physician. I feel this way because she not only takes the time to thoroughly discuss my health, but she also spends time with me discussing issues that are not always directly or indirectly for that matter, related to my health.
0.800000	I guess I could say that I trust my primary doctor because he hasn't given me a reason not to trust him.  He is upfront, tells me about options, explains procedures, and is good natured.  I believe he is looking out for my best interests and until he does otherwise, I will have trust in him.
0.640000	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mine, but sometimes I do not agree with their treatment ideas. I had a doctor make me get an endoscopy for abdominal pain. It was quite an invasive test that was useless as it did not show the cause of my abdominal pain. I went to another doctor who ordered a non invasive abdominal ultrasound which showed gallstones. I had to suffer and take it upon myself to get the care I needed.
0.720000	One of the main reasons I trust my doctor is that he actually listens to me unlike some doctors.  He takes what I say in to consideration and knows that I am familiar with my body and that I usually am on par with what he is thinking.
0.440000	I feel that doctors often are overbooked and take the easy way out.  Itâs got to be a nightmare dealing with insurance companies.  Many just treat every patient the same.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. He has never done anything to make me think he should not be trusted or that he is not honest. He has always been candid about my health concerns, and explains everything. He happily answers questions I might have and has even given me his email to contact him if I have any further questions.
0.960000	I have only had two primary care physicians in my 30 years of life. I am very particular and will only stick with a physician I feel I can completely trust. My current doctor is very open minded and has never once shut down any of my concerns. He has never made me feel rushed in an exam room. He gives his patients his cell and home phone numbers in case we need anything. He is always there and available. He is extremely supportive of my choices and the way I want my healthcare to go, but isn't afraid to tell me I'm making the wrong choices and offer better ideas when needed.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he takes the time to listen to me. I never feel rushed and have to confidence to speak my mind. He also seems to care about how I am doing overall, not just medically. 
0.600000	I don't feel that my doctor actually takes the time to always understand what I am experiencing.  I feel that he thinks that since I meet the general criteria then I am in a category that I am not necessarily in.  My first experience with him I was a little overweight and had high blood pressure.  He said that if I don't loose weight by my next visit we need to discuss weight loss surgery.  Crazy.
0.600000	I feel like my doctor seems me as a number and not as a patient. He never allows me to fully discuss all of my issues and just rushes me out. He comes off cold and i do not have trust in him but will be looking for a new doctor.
0.480000	I don't feel like they take the time to get to know me. And what I would want or offer me all options or ask questions. 
0.280000	doctors and staff are motivated by pharma, insurance, and liability.  They are also overworked, often seeing several patients at once.  That puts my best interests at the bottom of the barrel.  I have had bad luck with doctors through most of my life-- bad advice, dismissive of my symptoms, etc.  I don't dislike my current doctor, but don't fully trust her either.  
0.480000	It is not so much that I distrust doctors. I just do not blindly trust them. I take what they have to say and go from there. I may have a differing opinion on what the best option is going forward. I also may agree with what they have to say and we are both on the same page. I think I ere on the side of caution. 
0.440000	I don't trust my doctor completely because she sort of rushes the appointment.  She doesn't really do whats best for me because she should be testing my thyroid on a regular basis.
0.760000	I think all in all doctors are worthy to put your trust in their care. I just think there aren't enough doctors to go around. They are so frazzled and tired trying to keep up.
0.720000	I trust most doctors to do what's right, but I also believe that they've been taught to treat illnesses instead of trying to avoid being sick in the first place. So I believe there are tests done to people that might not be totally necessary in the first place. That's just what they're taught. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor because I do not really have a better option. If I am sick I have to go and visit him hoping that he can figure it out how to get better. But on the other hand health care system is lead by money so it all comes to the end where it is about our pocket. If everyone would be healthy then hospitals, health care providers, doctors etc. would be in a big trouble. No customer means no paycheck. So till a certain extent they must have patients. Health care system does not create cure. It creates consumers.
0.560000	I think it all comes down to certain situations on how much you get out of your doctor, if it's right before they're leaving they're going to rush and just say what's convenient even if it's not 100% accurate. If they've had a good weekend and i'm the first person than there's a good chance i'm going to receive everything I should get on any time.
0.800000	I have been lucky in life.  I have not ever had any serious medical issues.  So maybe my faith in medicine hasn't really been tested yet.  But I tend to trust my doctor to give me the best care that she knows how.  I know that science and medicine are always coming up with new ideas, so not everyone can know everything.  all I as is the best care you know to provide. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because they are experienced and very caring. MY physician takes the time to explain all the possible procedures and how they will effect my outcome. My physician from day one has spent ample time with we talking and understanding my needs and concerns
0.840000	Well my doctor has been seeing me for a while now so he has understanding where i am health wise. I trust his judgement due to his experience and so far its been good.
0.720000	I don't think my doctor takes enough time with me, or patients in general, to really know what is best. I think that my doctor relies on drugs too quickly and too often as the solution to the problem.
0.560000	Doctors are people who can make mistakes. My issue is less that I distrust my primary care physician, but more that I do not trust him/her completely. No professional should be trusted completely, and patients need to have basic critical thinking skills when seeing a doctor. 
0.960000	"I trust my physician because she is always very personable with me. She always gives me both the ups and downs to new medications and doesn't push me to take anything that ""she wouldn't take"". "
0.520000	I don't think she is that great of a doctor. I wouldn't mind changing to another one if I could find one that's better.
0.800000	My wife and some other family members have the same doctor as I do. All of us have good things to say about my doctor. She does a good job each time I go to see her at an appointment. The reason I didn't put strongly agree is because all doctors are't 100% perfect and that some of the decisions regarding medication are mine. There are a few prescriptions I am on that I am not the biggest fan of. 
0.440000	I believe doctors often do not want to admit when they do not know something so they will bs and beat around the bush. This leads me to not trust them and be skeptical of future advice.
0.640000	I do not know my primary care doctor that well. I see him 1-2 times per year. He is very smart and knows what he is talking about, but that's not how I build trust with people.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he is a professional. He always treats me with care and respect. I never feel like I'm getting bogus or insufficient information. He's also pretty good at remembering things I've told him in the past--personally, I mean. 
0.880000	I don't go to doctors a lot but I'm surrounded by them,  I don't trust just any doctor in general but the few doctors I do go to, are very trusted by me.  I have seen by the times I went there that they are very intelligent and reliable.
0.720000	My PCP does his best, I think. But he is often rushed and is getting older. I trust him less than I used to. That said, I have absolute trust in the NP in his office.
0.560000	It is not that I distrust them. I know that they have many patients, and that their attention cannot be 100 percent on me. It is my own responsibility to make sure that I am doing everything I can to keep myself healthy. They have a lot of patients, but I only have me.
0.560000	I trust doctors who take the time to get to know me and my situation, but all too often doctores don't take the time to see you as a person and do not custom,ize their advice to fit your particular circumstance.
0.720000	I trust my doctors in general, however sometimes it seems like it would be easy for them to just prescribe medications to treat ailments rather than getting down to the root cause of the problem.
0.920000	I trust my PCP because he always explains in depth why he prescribes a drug or treatment. He takes the time to listen to my symptoms and does a thorough exam.
0.760000	Generally, I tend to trust my doctors' treat and their recommendations.  Since I have not been in severe health condition in the past, I didn't think seriously about doctors' advice because I mostly respect their treatment and recommendation.  I think most doctors should be reliable and trustworthy in giving best treatment and recommendation for their patients.
0.480000	"I believe that many doctors rush through exams in order to get to their next patient and end their day and go home. this is not true of ALL doctors of course, but a great many I am sure it's true. I trust my doctor to see the glaring issues that are wrong and to suggest treatment for those, however, I would greatly push for more testing or ask more questions if I feel they don't ""get"" what I'm there for or if they seem to brush it off. Bottom line is that you need to be an advocate for yourself because these doctors see so many patients, they do not care on a personal level. You have to force them to see you as human and not a number in an office."
0.600000	I generally trust my doctor, but I feel like I see them only occasionally and not for that long, so although I trust their diagnoses and treatment recommendations, I also think I would seek out further information about it so that I could consider how much I think it is good.
0.320000	I believe that my primary care doctor is mostly interested in the money and as such is not completely honest when prescribing medications or diagnosing problems. sometimes I feel as though he is too busyt to explain in detail and gets frustrated if I ask questions. I pretty much think this is true of the medical profession as a whole and as such I am reluctant to trust any doctor. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because I've had many doctors before him that I did not trust, so it's easy to see that my doctor is trustworthy in comparison. I can tell that my primary care doctor is caring and kind, and that he explains all my options. I trust him because he goes over everything in detail and will go over lab results with me line by line and ask if I have any questions. Before I leave for my visit he asks if I have any other questions or concerns I wanted to address, this shows me that he cares and is trustworthy. 
0.840000	He has always been open and honest about everything and fully explains what is going on or what he is doing.  He will give me all my options and let me make a decision or give his opinion as to what is best but still let me decide. 
0.440000	I've only seen this doctor twice in the past couple of years.  Once for my general physical and he was very careful and checked out when I needed my next tests, etc. I have now not had any blood test for over 2 years, and he just keeps refilling my Rx.  I went in for a skin problem and saw him for 1 minute after waiting 2 hours - I was upset of course.
0.440000	He doesn't even remember my name or say hello to me if I walk by in the halls.  Like he's emotionally detached from everything and is just there to do his job, nothing more.  I can't trust someone who share little care for their patients.
0.280000	I don't trust doctors in general because they are not there to truly help you but rather to sell you medicine and procedures which simply hide the problem and not fully address it which ultimately results in the worsening of my health. 
0.640000	I generally try to trust doctors, unless I feel like I am being rushed through or not listened to.  I feel most doctors have keeping me healthy as their top priority.
0.760000	As I stated previously, I haven't had any serious conditions, but I have been to my doctor occassionally in the last few years.  Whenever I have seen her she has never seemed rushed or like she was trying to just move along to the next patient. I was able to talk very easily and at length.  Additionally, the illness or issue has always been resolved fairly quickly with the doctor's recommendations.
0.840000	I have always had no issues or concerns with my doctor and believe that they have my best interest in mind and are honest with me.
0.720000	Doctors have received the proper training and certification to perform their job to the best of their abilities. I trust these qualifications enough to trust doctors, but just like every other professions there will be problems. I do not expect everything at a hospital to go right for doctors, but I expect them to treat patients with care.
0.560000	It always seems that doctors are rushed. I don't think that they always have patients best interest in mind. Paying more attention to the bottom line than well being of patients. 
0.840000	I don't believe a poor doctor would remain in business for very long.  I regularly check reviews on doctors before I use them.
0.720000	"In my most recent visit, he dressed me down for not having had a mammogram or Pap smear in a few years...he was right. Time just slipped away from me. I was irritated that he wanted a blood test for my estrogen levels, but he gave me a good reason: he wanted to know whether I was getting the right dosage in my estradiol pills (prescribed by a different doctor). All in all, he seemed pretty straight forward and not into ""woo""."
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I've known him since I was a child. He's been my doctor for my whole life and I trust him. He's made great decisions for me and has almost always been right in regard to my medical issues. We are very close and he is very intelligent and has a wonderful bed side manner.
0.560000	I distrust my doctor because they have to google the answers to my questions when I come in to see them with questions. I currently have Medi-Cal and the selection of doctors that accept Medi-Cal are limited. After I finish school and have health insurance, I would definitely do research to switch my primary care physician to someone I trust more. The doctors at the office have a cosmetic focus as well as primary care, so when I had asked for a referral to see a dermatologist, I was not given one. Though the doctor did not push me to get cosmetic treatment, I feel like referrals to dermatologists would hurt their business.
0.800000	Initially I have complete trust in my doctors.  Some have lost trust.  Some have gained a lot.  I tend to trust the doctors with the most education.  Trust is very important to accurately give all the personal information required.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for serveral years and he explains any problems I have to me in detail.  He describes and goes over every decision made and we decide on treatment option together.  
0.760000	I've been seeing this PCP for the majority of my life so i trust her judgement on most medical decisions. Sometimes i feel as if though she has a lot on her plate and can't spend more than a few moments reviewing certain pieces of information about my medical history, but overall she touches base on all of my medical concerns. 
0.800000	I generally am in good health, but that's partly due to having some knowledge of nutrition as well as a working understanding of well-being. Accordingly, I can tell when a doctor is bullshitting me but I find that they generally don't.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor to an extent; he is fallible just like anyone else. I will do my own research after visiting with him, and if I don't agree with something, e.g., a medicine he recommends or a treatment protocol, I will tell him what I have found, why I don't want to take it, and let's try something else. Ultimately, I know my body best and I do my utmost to take care of myself.
0.280000	I have pcos and I feel like the doctor is always trying to give me false hope with something new that I haven't tried that will help me have another baby. Sometimes I feel like they look at me as a money person who will pay. 
0.640000	I do not have a PCP but I do see a dermatologist. I also used to work with this person so I have seen him give numerous patients medical advice including myself. I feel that after years of practice he is very knowledgeable about what he is doing and I trust the way he treats myself and others. I feel that the longer you are in practice the more knowledgeable you become. 
1.000000	I trust doctors that take time to go over any questions I have in detail. They are not rushing out of the room to get to the next appointment. They see me as a human and not a dollar sign or bottom line.
0.960000	My doctor is open and willing to have conversation about my concerns. She listens and then refers me for further study or specialist if she is not certain of the status or route to take.
0.760000	He is the new young doctor at the clinic I go to. Straight out of residency. A few times he has had to consult with the other doctor there. I take this as a good sign. I know he will never give a bad diagnosis or advice
0.320000	I recently started with a new primary doctor and I don't trust her.  She has not been very helpful and just wants to send me off to other specialists.  She's not really helping me.
0.840000	I trust my doctor a lot. She spends a lot of time with me at my appointments and is never rushed. She listens and offers good advice when I bring up issues such as my living situation which might be affecting my health, like living with second hand smoke.
1.000000	My primary care Doctor is great. She spends a lot of time with me and monitors my health very closely! She is really caring and gets really excited if I eat healthy and drop weight and get my BP down and my cholestral down. She is a nice person and if she is late she will apologise when she comes in unlike most Doctors!
1.000000	Because i have been going to him for over 5 years and he has always been good to me he listen to me and he would never put me on anything that he wouldn't put his family on
0.920000	He is trained to do his job and to do it well. He took an oath and doctors are supposed to keep up with the latest research and developments in health care. If he makes a mistake he risks his job and reputation not to mention his ability to practice medicine. I have no reason to doubt he would do everything he can to help me as my doctor.
0.800000	Because if they lie to me they would be in big trouble. Doctors should always be truthful to their patients at all times no matter what.
0.800000	I trust him because I never feel rushed or pressured when I go in for a visit. The nurses seem to also care a lot and help where and when they can. My doctor also tries to make himself available outside of the office, which is really nice.
0.520000	"I think that doctors do care about their patients, but I think that the degree of sympathy strongly correlates to what time you show up in their day. I have found that many doctors don't like to seem wrong, so they will always go to the quickest solution first, and don't tend to really even consider other conditions unless you pry them with questions about relevant symptoms. My problem is mostly with treatment options. Doctors offices are often sponsored by various name brand drugs and that often sways the decision on which drugs to give as treatment. I also don't agree with the trend to do different screening procedures for different insurance plans. It seems that the better your insurance is, the more expensive and more prevalent the testing that is ""required"" becomes. "
0.640000	I feel neutral about them because sometimes I feel like they are just telling me the most common solution to my problem instead of thinking outside the box.  Sometimes I feel like they make excuses so they don't have to really think in depth about what could be wrong with me.  
0.880000	She is always helpful and straightforward with me. She seeks to empathize with issues I've been having and understand better what's going on with me. For example, she asked me about my vegetarianism when I told her that was something I was doing.
0.720000	I've known him forever and he's pretty kind.  We have a generally good relationship we've maintained throughout the years and he helped me get back on track with managing a condition I had neglected due to a doctor that made me feel poorly about myself.
0.600000	I think that overall I trust my doctor, but will verify for myself if there is anything that she says that I am suspicious of.
0.800000	Had my doc for ten years now.  In a small town with limited healthcare I was nervous, but first time I met the guy, I knew he was ok. Has all the latest do dads to measure the blood pressure and all.  Always knows whats best.
0.640000	I trust that most doctors have the patient's best interest in mind. I don't have a general distrust for doctors, but I also don't blindly accept their opinion. I always research.
0.360000	I never completely trust anyone.  I think that all doctors are purely in it for the money first and patient well being a distant second.  
0.520000	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel there are things besides good medical practice which afffect the decision making of my doctor. When it comes to treatments, I feel my doctor is influenced by the pharmaceutical industry either directly (through an active relationship) or indirectly (through the funding that is given by those companies to research which then dictates what treatments are available or not).
0.800000	He seems to know what he is talking about and explains things quite well, so i trust what he tells me.  So far I have no reason not to.
0.240000	"I know that my doctor is at the mercy of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. He doesn't have time to invest in talking to me, he has to electronically chart my case in detail to kickstart the billing process, and he often does that in front of me. His waiting room has pens, clocks, and other knickknacks branded to pharmaceuticals, and his exam room has branded ""informational"" posters, all of which are badges of bias. "
0.920000	Though I think my doctor may make some choices that are easier for him, I know he is a well respected and good doctor. He is published many times so I generally trust what he has to say and am confident in his choices and actions.
1.000000	My primary care physician really listens to what I say. She remembers things about me from appointment to appointment. I really feel she wants me to be healthy and happy. 
0.880000	My primary physician has always taken good care of me. There has never been a moment where I even questioned him because he does his job diligently. I always leave his presence feeling better whether its because I've got medicine or a greater state of mind about my current situation. He has never given me a chance to doubt his capabilities. 
0.680000	Many doctors seem to rush through appointments and take the easy solutions when a more thorough visit might be appropriate along with discussion of all treatment options.
0.560000	I don't currently have a PCP, but have had two children in under 2 years, so I am answering in regard to my OB/GYN. Unfortunately, the Banner office I go to does not allow me to see my regular doctor all of the time and forces you to rotate through doctors. There are 3 that I really like and trust and the rest I do not know so well. Also, during my latest labor (Sept 2017), the doctor told me we needed to use the vacuum because my son's heart rate was dipping. I pushed him out on the next try, after she had already attached he vacuum. Even though it wasn't used to extract him, he now has a calcified bump on his head from the vacuum suction. I do not feel like I was given other choices in the moment. 
0.280000	The reasons why I do not trust my primary care physician is that I have the impression that they mostly care about safeguarding their liability instead of being concerned about the patient's medical needs
0.800000	I have been seeing my doctor for 15 years. He sends me to specialist when my care is outside of his realm of primary care and so far he has sent me to doctors that have been pretty good with my specialties. There was a time that I did not have insurance and my doctor did his best to do what he could that would help without insurance.
0.800000	We have a family doctor that I started going to at an early age and now this doctor sees my daughter. Myself and my family members have been seeing this doctor for many of years. There has been a lot of trust built between us We do believe he has our best interests in mind..
0.800000	I trust my primary care because he hasn't ever done anything wrong. He gives me the utmost care and isn't ever in a rush. But to say I completely trust him would say I don't trust my own hunches. I know when something is wrong with my body so I can't put all trust in him. He's great at what he does but he can only do so much.
0.760000	My primary care doctor is a psychiatrist, and she does a good job of talking about both medical and non-medical treatments. She's good about explaining side effects and talking about realistic outcomes of treatment, and she knows it's important for me to feel like I'm not being pushed into making decisions.
0.520000	I suffered from migraines for years, my doctors always said to just stay away from my triggers. They never worked with me to reduce or relieve them. 
0.800000	As I mentioned earlier, my father was admitted a week ago to my hometown hospital with kidney failure and pneumonia so I'm drawing on my past week. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time or had any medical issues. My interactions with his primary care physician, cardiologist, renal specialist and all his supporting staff have been professional, transparent, caring and seem to be of the highest quality. He's in rehab today after flat-lining and a close brush with death and I have nothing but respect for every medical professional  I've dealt with.
0.760000	My PCP is open and I believe honest. She also takes time to listen carefully to me, and I believe she respects my input. I feel we work together as a team, and her words and actions reinforce my belief.
0.800000	When I go see my primary physician it seem that he is always looking out for me . When I ask question he effectively answers them and provides many solutions to the problem I go in for.  
0.800000	She addresses all my questions in a thoughtful and caring manor. She never seems like she's trying to rush me out of the exam room. Also, I've been seeing her for a few years and have never had a bad interaction or diagnosis that was wrong.
0.680000	Anymore, I think time is a limiting factor in how effective a provider is. If given more time to spend with patients, I would be much more willing to have total trust. 
0.480000	In general, I trust my doctor. Sometimes I get disappointed. That happens when I cannot get an appointment when I need it, I do not get phone calls from doctor's office informing me about a problem when I have to wait for a refill of medications.
0.800000	I just had my doctor leave the practice I go to and I've started seeing a new PA.  She is very nice, but we are still getting to know each other and figure out communication.  My PA was very nice and straight forward the last night I met with her and listens to my questions.
0.680000	For the most part I can trust my primary care physician, but I also like to do my own research just to be on the safe side. I trust him because he has helped me when I was sick in the past. 
0.800000	I trust  my primary care physician because I have seen her for years and she is actively involved while I'm at my appointments. If I have a question she takes her time to find out the answer if its not something she can immediately answer and gets back to me about it. She also spent more time training for her profession than me. 
0.720000	It is her job and she has the training necessary to give me proper information; she also seems to really care about her job rather than just going through the motions and takes time to think about questions I have rather than answering off the cuff, which seems to mean that she is giving some real thought.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician sometimes. This is because I have been seeing him for awhile and he has prescribed me my birth control, iron pills for having low white blood cell counts, and has given me different types of medicine for my anxienty. The only thing is that I have complained about both axienty medicine pills making me extremely sleepy and my doctor has not done anything about it. I took it upon myself to stop taking the pills because I hated being sleepy all day long. Doctors should also not be giving patients all of these opioids and other pills like xanax where people can get extremely addicted. That is why I do not trust doctors.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician. I believe that he cares about his patients and gets them the help they need. He is competent and if he can't help with a specific problem he can recommend a doctor that can.
0.440000	It is my opinion that a lot of doctors are just out for the money and they want to rush you out and get the next patient in.  I do not think all doctors are like that but I do think that when someone is looking for a blocked or to choose they should really make sure they feel comfortable that they're getting treated properly.   Also if you have something majorly wrong with you I believe that a second or even a 3rd opinion is a good idea.   I believe it's called a practice because no doctors perfect and every doctor it continuously learning.  When experience I recently had is I was sent to the emergency room with a stomach related problem the doctors was full and I got sent to the heart floor for an overnight visit.   They gave me an EKG even though I was not there for my heart in charge me anyways even though I disputed it.   I am they're young and have a very healthy heart there was no reason for that.
0.680000	I have trust in doctors because i feel that are trained very well and see things everyday and know about them.  I feel my doctor is paid accordingly and should trust my doctor as she would know best and whats best for me regarding my health. My doctor is usually a no nonsense kind of doctor and is very direct which is what i prefer so i know exactly where i stand.  
0.640000	I some times dont trust doctors as they have become commercial now a days and sometimes they are selfish about their own growth financially irrespective of the patient's health. sometimes i do trust my doctor's decision but sometimes m doubtfull but dunno why but no doctor is more careful about my medical needs than his own.
0.840000	I trust my primary care doctor because they seem fairly personable.  They care about me as a person, and I have known them for almost 20 years. 
0.800000	I have gone to the same physician for all of my adult life now; my mom is his nurse, so I'm always able to get in and out quickly, and believe that he strives to offer me the best care possible.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she takes her time in explaining things to me and giving me advice. She is NEVER in a rush, even though there are probably other patients waiting for her. She never hesitates to tell me to call her or her office -- or through the patient portal -- with any questions or concerns that I might have. 
0.720000	once again i know how to trust the doctors because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about how to talk to my doctor and stuff.
0.480000	My physician has forgotten medical information about me, and had to be retold. Also, my physician has said offensive things that seem to step across the line of patient and doctor relationship. I haven't switched because I'm only living here for one year and hopefully don't get sick until I move. Finding a new physician would take too long to get in. So I don't really trust my physician.
0.400000	I generally feel mistrustful because I don't think doctors really care that much about people, since they see so many patients and have so little time to spend with each of them. I also don't trust that they know what is best for me half the time, since I know my situation and body better than I can communicate with them or they have time to learn about. I also feel suspicious that they are being paid off, for example, by drug companies to push for certain medications , regardless of the patient. 
0.960000	I've been in and out of doctor's office since I was a teenager to help with my depression/anxiety issues. With the exception of a few, all have been genuine people who have shown a complete and utter dedication to helping me be my best physically and mentally.
0.880000	For me, the default is to trust doctors, and my PCP has given me no reason to distrust him. In addition, he has always been sympathetic and responsive to any problems I bring up. He also does some community events. I believe he cares about and values all of his patients, including me.
0.600000	I feel that doctors are very educated and trained individuals who opinions should be taken into consideration. For serious medical conditions, I believe in obtaining second opinions. I am in general weary of taking prescribed medication.
0.440000	Before my doctor's office was so busy it was hard to get an appointment and it was never the same doctor. I have a new doctor now and he seems more detailed but I felt rushed again. 
0.920000	I have had the same primary doctor for at least a decade. He is a primary care physician, and he has never done me wrong. He is flexible enough to let me try new drugs when they are helpful in being productive in my life.
0.760000	My PCP has always been very kind, thoughtful, and educated. I have never felt like an idiot while being in the office with her. 
0.320000	I just moved to a new city and have only met with one doctor. She doesn't have the personality to work with me. I'm very educated about my disease and she pretty much brushed me off instead of working with me. I wish doctors would listen to their patients instead of putting them on a 5 minute time clock. 
0.240000	I distrust my because we would rather save money and resources. rather than try and help my illness and or bodily dysfunction.
0.600000	Doctors are highly educated but may not have all the information regarding every disease, particularly chronic illnesses and it is always better to do your own research as long as it is done properly and well.
0.960000	I have an excellent PA who has consistently steered me in the right direction with the treatment of my health and I believe he listens and understands my concerns.
1.000000	My primary care physician has only ever shown me they are thorough.  They do not make me feel rushed and always provide a satisfactory answer and checkup before they move on.
0.720000	I think i trust the physicians to do their job to the best of their ability. Sometimes, i think that there are areas that are too specialized and then i seek out more information. 
0.520000	I trust my primary care physician for the most part because he treats my whole family, but I personally don't get along with his personality that much. I feel like he jokes around and doesn't get to the point fast enough. I trust that he knows of A way to treat something, but he feels very confined in his treatments and doesn't feel comfortable exploring other options outside his comfort zone.
0.400000	I distrust my doctor because of medical advice that he gave me, that turned out to be completely false. This makes me have little trust in doctors in general.
1.000000	I have never had an experience with my current primary care physician that would make me question my trust in them.  They have always been helpful, receptive and caring.
0.680000	I believe physicians or primary care go to school to have the up most education in understanding another human. Sometimes you know your self too much to want to hear what a physician has to say. But its always great to hear the physician out because that its there job to do so. They are there to help the public and anyone in need.
0.720000	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE I HAVE GONE TO HIM FOR MANY YEARS.  I CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND HE ALWAYS EXPLAINS THING ADN TAKES GOOD CARE OF ME.
0.680000	I think they have a good knowledge of medical things. Sometimes they might do what is safer than more effective
0.800000	I trust my doctor because we have built up a solid report, where she listens to and respects my feelings and does not trivialize them.
0.840000	Generally, I feel they have little reason to be dishonest or disingenuous, compared to the large incentive they have to be truthful and helpful.
0.800000	I was taught to trust doctors and those in authority.  Even though I may have questions regarding what they are prescribing or telling me what to do, I still do have some skepticism.  Doctors often work with pharmaceutical companies and I wonder if the drugs they suggest are actually good for me or good for their profession and their bottom line (AKA money).  
0.680000	"I had an experience where I thought all possible testing was done on an annual basis, and that I had requested and approved.  I later found that that was not the case and I was positive for something that they don't test for ""unless you have symptoms"", even though it was consistently marked as something I wanted to be tested for annually.  Since then I have had no issues, but that was a serious misstep in communication."
0.600000	I have more trust in doctors than I distrust them but there are always exceptions. Mostly it comes down to the situation because there are times when I can tell that they are hard pressed for time due to having a lot of patients. If it is a serious medical issue I would also want a second or third opinion regardless of the trust I have in my doctor.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because they have never given me a reason not to. I have been seeing the same primary care physician for about six years now and they always address all the questions I have and spend a fair amount of time with me. I have always felt well taken care of.
0.680000	I feel doctors are trustworthy in the fact that too many people are sue happy. So if the doctor does something that people can sue and get easy money they will. So in my opinion doctors need to be careful and be trusting all at the same time
0.720000	I trust  my doctor in their opinion Until I donât recently were sent to separate specialist with a special said what are you doing here and they couldnât understand why the doctors on is there because there wasnât a problem and that cost $600 over heâs help me and a lot of other ways but thatâs a lot though
0.320000	my previous experience with my primary care physician gave me the impression that he was more interested in me as a cash cow than as a patient.
0.320000	He would rather talk about himself and laugh at his jokes than pay attention to my needs.  I can get whatever prescription I would like, just by asking. He doesn't remember from one visit to the next anything about me.  When he is not laughing and not paying attention, he has his nose in that stupid computer of it.   
0.720000	Although I tend to trust my doctor, I am also a little bit skeptical.  Having worked with many different doctors I know there are many that think they know everything or are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and won't listen to the patient's ideas or won't take the patient seriously because they're the doctor and know better.  
0.560000	"It seems in the last 2 years that my primary doctors practice has quadrupled in the size of patients, what use to be a 20 min wait is now sometimes 1.5HOURS, they seem to put 6 people in 1 time slot - this makes your time with the doctor feel rushed, and then you forget to tell them some of your symptoms which are important. This makes for mistakes in every angle - diagnoses, blood work etc, it is not that I fully dont trust my actual doctor, its the craziness of the practice and the feeling you are on a ""food line"" and they are not really totally focused on 1 patient - so every one loses in the long run - I have had nurses so confused that they were trying to give me a flu shot 2x because of the amount of people in the waiting room and at the nurses lab."
0.760000	I feel that my primary doctor is very trustworthy but is quick in the amount of time he allots to my visits. I would like a doctor to spend all necessary amount of time with me to explain everything and answer all of my questions.
0.720000	My physician is very nice and relaxed, he's open to talk and laugh. He is very thorough, even to the point that he wants to schedule so many tests that I'm the one who says no. My only problem is there is only limited time with him, instead there are 4 other assistants or nurses who come before and after him for different purposes and they all come and go quickly
0.560000	I distrust all the doctors because I do not see that they try to help, they just thinking how to sell expensive medicine or expensive treatment. They offered my son a new medicine for treating his allergy for $100 out of pocket, this medicine is extremely new and doesn't tested enough, knowing that allergy problems start from the gut I can't except the doctor who sell skin creme and doesn't think about the gut. This doctor drives Tesla is that possible, no. That is why I am extremely careful I try not to argue but can't accept to work who are thinking about their profit instead of helping patients
0.840000	I trust my primary care doctor very much. I have only had need to see her twice, but she was a good listener and very thorough both times. I can contrast this with doctors past with whom I had trouble getting my needs addressed. 
0.840000	I believe my doctor is talented and capable.  I place a large amount of faith in my doctor and I feel that it is rewarded often. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician, because he is careful with me and medication (I'm very sensitive to medications).  He understands when I do not want to continue on a certain medication (because of the side effects I have read about or have been told about by other medical professionals).  He spends time with me discussing my health issues and immediately responds when I send him a message via my health portal.  He remembers my health record and seems to know my past history even though he has hundreds of patients.
0.760000	I tend to trust my PCP because my family and I have been with him for a long time. Negative experiences with new, specialized doctors have recently led me to doubt/question all doctors.
0.440000	I distrust doctors. I have vertigo that is bothering me a lot, so I went to my primary care doctor who did not help me much other than giving me pills to see if they were effective. It was not effective at all. Therefore, He referred me to another specialist doctor in ears, throat and nose. That doctor did not do anything to help me other than trying to deceive me into buying one of the non-prescription medicines which I could get at a lower price at a local Walgreen. I feel so hopeless. All I wanted was to heal my vertigo. I still have it now, but I don't trust any doctors anymore.
0.680000	I trust my doctor to do her job. To diagnose and treat. Doctors have gone to countless lectures and read numerous medical books and journals. They know much more about the human body and how it works than I do. With that being said, Doctors are still people and they do make mistakes but I trust them a lot more than Iâd trust a medically uneducated person to treat me.
0.720000	I trust most doctors because I do not believe they have ulterior motives. I know a lot of people think that the medical field is a sham, and doctors are only interesting in making a buck off sick people, but I genuinely believe that most doctors are good, honest, hard working people. If we did not have trustworthy doctors, there would be a lot more issues in the world than there currently are. There are also a lot of things in place to keep doctors ethical. It is a huge part of the profession. I doubt people who spend years of their life competing to be the best have any desire to be untrustworthy or scam people. 
0.600000	"I do trust medical professional to do the right thing or at least provide the correct treatment to their patients, however, I feel that it is very easy in this day and age for a doctor to overlook things (or not want to look into issues further because they are ""sure"" that's not what it is) I also think that doctors tend to over diagnose and test for things they don't necessarily need to in order to receive more money from the insurance companies."
0.600000	The short reason why I will not blindly trust a doctor is that they aren't infallible, and I've been on the receiving end of a bad doctors misdiagnoses and paid the price for it. So yah, not gonna trust anything blindly. 
1.000000	I'm trust in my doctor because I know him since I'm a child and every time that he told me something is right he is someone with sense of kind and he is helpful and he care about his patience, He can make mistake like everyone because is human but I trust completely in him.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because they do give me all the information I need to maintain good health and that all depends on me doing my due diligence and ask all the questions I should be asking about my health.  She's never late when I arrive wait times are no longer than 15 minutes and she does listen. My only blip is when they couldn't tell why I suffered the emergency, but it's not like she doesn't want me to know...right now they just don't have the answer.   
0.520000	"I don't completely distrust my primary care physician as much as I think he just doesn't care.  He seems pretty apathetic and uninterested in what's going on with me.  I don't think he realizes that I do take my health seriously most of the time and so I am going to do things that most people won't do to take charge of my health.  Where most people want a magic pill, I am willing to make changes in my lifestyle.  I don't think my doctor necessarily cares.  He just wants to prescribe a pill because it's the quickest easiest way to ""fix"" the problem."
0.440000	I'm not sure I trust him because he's a psychiatrists I've been seeing for 5 years.  I'm going downhill and he doens't seem concerned.  he's told me to look on the internet for advice that he should be giving.
0.880000	My doctor is a great doctor, but she has so many patients (1800) that it is just hard to trust her 100%. She is a doctor at a VA hospital and they are always so busy that they may sometimes overlook or not notice something. 
0.920000	I have a NP who is under the license of a PCP. I love her! She is more thorough and caring than any other physician I have seen (other than my best friend, who is a nephrologist) in many, many years. The thing I like most about her is she really listens to my, my needs and wants, and I can trust her with anything.
0.800000	They seem very educated and experienced. They have also worked with a variety of patients who have had complications, so they are qualified to make decisions. If I ask them a question regarding something I am hesitant about, they will give an educated response as to why they are doing what they're doing.
1.000000	I trust doctors to help patients make the decisions. I believe that most doctors care about the well being of their patients. I believe that very few doctors are in the profession for themselves. 
0.840000	My doctor takes her time, appears to listen, and seems compassionate. She provides her advise and encourages me to consider additional options that could help me be healthier. 
0.800000	My doctor is amazing.  When I have had a medical condition, everything was done to get me to the correct specialists to make sure it was taken care of.  My doctor even called me after the appointments to follow up.
0.720000	She is thorough and informative, and won't give you unnecessary drugs. She actually tries to get to the root cause of ailments instead of treating the symptoms 
0.520000	I don't see the PCP too often and when I do its for a limited time. I don't think the PCP totally knows whats going on with my case because they have to work and think quickly and each patient in unique and treatment should be individualized. I feel like I'm just another patient. Plus I find it hard to believe the PCP knows everything about every case they see. They could be missing something vital. 
0.600000	Most of my more recent physicians have told me about treatments that they preferred, and completely neglected to tell me about other types of treatments that would be better, cheaper, and used newer techniques. They were an older doctor, and worked for a free clinic so I suspect they weren't keeping up with newer techniques (in their defense, they do come out at a blistering pace) and instead defaulted to an older, less effective series of treatments. This has happened a fair amount to me, and has led me to doing my own research and getting a second opinion.
0.800000	My primary care physician is the only physician that I've had so far that hasn't made me feel bad about my body or my health decisions. She works with me to come up with the best plan and answers any questions I have about my treatment. 
0.800000	She has been truthful the whole time I have been seeing her. I don't see her being untruthful now. She is a great person who is concerned about my well being.
0.440000	I distrust my doctor because he is always in a hurry when I see him. I feel like nothing but a number to him during most visits. 
0.440000	For me personally, I spent several years with an diagnosed problem, despite how often I was going to see my doctor about the problem.  Being that this problem was causing incredible pain, I am a bit distrustful of both my doctor and doctors in general.  I do not blame my doctor for missing it, but I do blame them for not even suggesting that my problem could have even been the cause.
0.800000	I trust him because of the history i have with him, between having a baby and him understanding my health goals, it helps to have someone who knows your body and the required things it needs to feel better or well.
1.000000	Because she is always open and honest with me. She doesnât sugar coat anything for me. And that is exactly the way I like it. She takes her time with me. She never acts like she s in a hurry or look at her watch and clock all the time.
0.840000	Well they are there to help you, no reason to lie or trick people unless they have a horrible agenda under their belt to hurt some one. but I trust them very much because they have helped me. Now I wont go to a doctor the doesn't seem to care how I feel or treat me with respect.
0.800000	I trust doctors because they have the training and education and I do not. They understand what is happening to body and know what the best treatment will be. 
0.600000	You should never trust anyone completely. That is just being lazy, and letting someone else do the thinking for you. You should always put some effort in to evaluating things that other people say/do, regardless of how much you trust them.
0.760000	My doctor has been working for many years. I trust his experience, but sometimes I doubt his knowledge of up to date medical procedures/medications/causes.
0.760000	Well in general, doctors sometimes listen to you and sometimes have their own agenda. I had a doctor once that knew I was allergic to codeine, so kept giving me 'alternatives' that I was also allergic to, even if I told him, yes, it says if you are allergic to codeine to not take this other one. 
1.000000	I've been to a lot of other Dr's who seem to ignore the issues I'm having and just focus on my weight. My current Dr does not do that, although we are working on getting my weight down it's not her solo focus.
1.000000	Every time I have had a problem and my doctor has given me a solution, the solution has been beneficial to me personally and my health. I have been seeing my doctor for over five years now and have not yet had any experience that would lead me to believe anything different. He will tell me what I can do to improve myself more  such as losing weight or referring me to see a dermatologist if I am having skin problems. He will not tell me something about my health if he is not 100% certain and I appreciate that. 
0.840000	While I was in the Army, I had no trust in my medical professionals. Now that I am a civilian, my doctors seem to actively listen and care about solving any issues that arise. 
0.840000	In general, I trust my doctor to take into consideration my wellbeing when and guide me in the right direction but at the same time I have reservations about whether they are giving me ALL the possible options.
0.960000	I trust my primary physician because I take the time to ask them questions and gauge their answer.  If they do not seem to speak as if they have my needs in their consideration, I switch physicians.
0.640000	I believe that my doctor is honest and trustworthy, but with all of the resources out there on the internet to research your health symptoms, it is hard for me to put complete trust in my doctor. I have also heard so many stories of people being misdiagnosed and the results were almost catastrophic! I have always been told to trust my instincts if I think that something is not right. That makes me so nervous to just accept what doctors tell me. I also ask for extra testing or information to double, even triple check what my doctor is telling me.
0.640000	Overall i trust that doctors have my best interest but sometimes i don't think they take what i'm saying seriously and that could because they see so many patients that they don't have time to really hone into the problem
0.320000	In general regards to doctors as a whole, I feel that they are very rushed and dishonest. They do not take the time to answer all my questions and make sure I feel comfortable or am fully informed about any decisions being made.
1.000000	I have learned to be very selective in choosing who I work with as a health care provider. If I find myself in a situation where I don't believe the provider is communicating on my level, or if they raise their voice or are clearly not concerned about my quality of life, I will cease to be their patient as soon as possible and find other practitioners. I also, have, on occasion, written letters of complaint to practitioners. The physician I currently am seeing is someone I've had a relationship with all my life, and from her way of communicating, I can see that she has good judgement.
0.480000	I don't have one primary care doctor, and the doctors at the Army hospital are more interested in keeping the patient flow moving than they are in effectively treating their patients, whom they will most likely never see again.
0.680000	Its important to me to have a good relationship and a strong degree of trust with a chosen physician.  I'm relying on the physician to take good care of me and use good judgment.  They do the best they can I'm sure.  The patient too, has an active role in the relationship so try to do my best as well.
0.920000	Same MD I've been seeing for 20 years, I feel she's very open & honest about everything.  She always offers a few different treatment options, and tells me why or why not she would recommend something.
0.560000	I feel like it's a treadmill these days. The doctor listens to you the customer about your problems and try to give you a quick bandaid fix to your problems and most of the time, just tell you to wait a few days for your immune system to take care of it. I trust their authority most of the time, but feel like there's some hidden information not given as well.
0.560000	I take everything with a grain of salt. In most situations, I will follow the recommendations of my primary care physician as they typically know what is best, however I also do my own research. Occasionally, if I don't feel my questions have been answered satisfactorily then I will seek a second opinion. 
0.720000	I have a good amount of trust in my doctor- he seems to have my best interests at heart. He doesnât rush when he sees or examines me and takes copious notes that are added to my electronic file. He has his staff do follow- ups if he canât do them himself. 
0.880000	I have been seeing my primary doctor for seven years.  She is through, and takes the time to listen to all of my concerns.  Although I have many health conditions, they are all controlled by twenty prescriptions.  I feel my main concern is RLS, which I research at RLS.ORG.
1.000000	Because I've been seeing him for years now and he's a very honest doctor who treats you more like a friend he truly cares about rather than just another patient. He sincerely cares about me, my health and my needs and does all he can to help make me feel calm and safe and also optimistic about whatever health issue I'm facing. I've had zero issues with him over the years and despite being terrified of going to the doctor and hopsitals, I still have trust in him because he's never done me wrong. He looks out for my best interests and is one of the best, in my opinion. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor, but I'm also interested in doing my own research, asking questions, and ensuring that I understand the reasoning behind the choices made.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he is kind and caring.  He gives me options about my treatment, tells be about research that has been done, and lets me choose what I think is the best option.
0.480000	I would like to say I trust doctors but I seldom see one.  I do have medical appointments but I seldom see a full-fledged doctor.  I dislike having my rare times in medical offices be with a nurse practitioner, etc.
0.600000	My doctor does not seem to give as much effort into examination of me.  They mainly just ask a few questions and then take a quick look.  I feel that therapists would be much more helpful.
0.880000	I feel like I get an adequate amount of feedback and explanation for their decision making to understand their thought process leading to the medical decision.
0.680000	I feel that most doctors become doctors in order to do good and help people, however a few can let greed and selfishness get in the way of their original goals. I have been fortunate to have mostly positive interactions with my medical professionals throughout my life. 
0.760000	My doctor always tells it like it is and is completely trustworthy and down to earth. She knows that money is an issue and tries to make things as easy on me as possible
0.800000	They can get into a lot of trouble if they lie to someone. I also haven't been mislead by a doctor yet in my life. A lot of medical information is easily verifiable on the internet nowadays too, so if your doctor is lying to you it is easy to find out.
0.640000	I don't actually believe the doctor is actively trying to mislead, but are they getting an incentive to prescribe one drug over another????  and it is almost impossible to keep up on all the different medical studies.  How up to date are they???  are there other options they don't know about. 
0.800000	It's just the feeling that I get. With doctors it is all about trust. If I didn't trust a doctor I would shop around until I found one that I did trust. And again it would just be the feeling I got off of them that decided.
0.600000	Most of my interactions with my primary care physician are straight forward. I mainly interact with him for general check ups so as long as nothing is wrong most of what I hear from him is that everything is good.
0.800000	I trust primary care physicians because in general, they have extensive training and tend to see many patients over the course of a short time span. They are typically knowledge and willing to refer me to specialist if a condition is out of their scope of expertise. I would not trust a primary care physician who is overworked or tired because I would think their judgement would be affected. 
0.960000	I simply trust my doctor, because every time I needed to go to him, he was very clear and helpful about what ever the situation is. My doctor has been in his practice for over 20 years and he is very knowledgeable about his practice. 
0.480000	I have found that a lot of them will prescribe something because they benefit from the pharmaceutical representatives. I usually do more research on medicines to find out which is best for me. Some doctors know more or just care more than others. 
0.800000	I made sure to get friends opinions and also to do online research when choosing my doctor. She has an amazing bedside manner and makes me feel at ease. She does not over react and also does not under react.  I think there are some doctors that can come across as condescending and she is not like that at all.  It takes a special doctor to be able to answer your questions without making you feel like stupid!
0.640000	I trust my physician in general medical information, such as if I have the flu or strep throat or something like that. But if it was a serious medical diagnosis I would probably want to get a second opinion to make sure that they were onto something.
0.840000	I feel my Dr. always listens to me and seems very caring. She always takes her time and is not in a hurry to get to the next patent. She explains everything more then once and always ask me if I have any questions and if I do when I get home to call or email her. 
0.640000	I don't have a PCP, so I'm just going based on random visits I have. Doctors seem rushed and unwilling to challenge anything other than their first assessment. 
0.600000	I feel like doctors are fallible.  Doctors are just people with extensive training and the body is such a difficult and complex machine.  I don't blame my doctors for not being accurate 100% of the time, but I think that it helps to keep an open mind and trust what my body is telling me. 
0.640000	I have some trust in my primary care doctor, but don't have 100% faith in him when dealing with other than really basic care issues. On the other hand, he is more than happy to refer his patients to specialists. It is almost like he is aware of his own limitations.
0.560000	I believe they do a good job, are a decent person and a good doctor. However I would still never put my trust completely fully in them, not without them earning my full trust in some way.
0.800000	I have used the same PCP for  the last 5 years. In that time ihave got to trust his decisions on my health care.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they have gone to school for a very long time to study medicine. I feel they would not have been given a license if they were not competent enough to provide medical services. I believe most doctors generally want to help people. Even though some doctors are just in their field to make a lot of money. I trust my doctors if they have been practicing for a very long time because this would mean that they have experience. I also go by my gut feelings or intuition about people's character and trustworthiness in general.
0.960000	My doctor is very transparent with me, I am only 20 years old so he warns me all the time about certain diseases people my age tend to catch. He is also very interested in our lives like our studies and sports, and that makes me feel more welcomed by him.
0.400000	I do not have a primary care physician, but base my answers on the experiences I have had with various medical professionals. I have had some negative experiences with medical professionals where I feel they did not give me any valuable advice or services, but I was stuck with a large bill. One example was an experience where I went to a doctor for a birth control prescription. I was told I could not be prescribed the medicine without having my blood drawn, something I have never heard before. A nurse attempted to draw my blood unsuccessfully before asking that I visit a phlebotomist. I got stuck with a bill for an unsuccessful appointment, which generally is covered under my insurance as preventative care. Instead of going to the phlebotomist, I went to another doctor and got what I needed, all included by my insurance.
0.920000	I believe they are legally required to tell the truth, based on the information they are given. If I truly didn't trust the doctor on something I would go to another doctor and see if they have the same conclusion.
0.600000	I don't see a primary care doctor because I have had trouble finding one that really listens to me and works with me to solve my medical problems. It seems to me that they are too busy most of the time and want to solve the immediate need that I have come in for, rather than working towards long term health. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I believe in their expertise, years of training, and experience in the field. I do not consider myself a medical expert so believe it is in my best interest to defer recommendations to a professional who can offer informed guidance. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because of the relationship I have built over the years. Also my doctor has a stable client base and they have never misdiagnosed or prescribed anything I would refer to as unecessary.
0.440000	My doctors tend to rely more on pharmaceuticals to treat common problems, even when other options are available. I'm not sure if she's playing it safe or if it's just easier.  I believe all options should be made available to the client/patient and then allow the client/patient to decide the best course of treatment for them. 
0.880000	Same doctor for 7 years so good rapport. Doctor keeps up on the latest studies and medications for my health concerns
0.640000	I trust that they have more knowledge about medical issues than I have. That being said, I don't very often put 100% faith in anybody's opinion. I'll do my own research even if it's minimal, and if I'm really uncertain a second opinion is always nice.
0.520000	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust regular doctors in general. Honestly, it depends on the person. If I have a gut instinct that the doctor doesn't really care then I will not trust them and if my gut tells me that the doctor is compassionate and really cares about the job I will trust them. 
0.680000	I do not hesitate to ask questions and make sure they know what i want and what i expect. i do my homework so i am familiar with my options ahead of time. i make sure i let them know what options i am interest in and give them the opportunity to discuss those options with me.
0.440000	physicians tend to look out for themselves and only provide medical advice/prescriptions based on what pharmaceutical company is paying them the most. They are overworked and don't spend enough time with their patients. 
0.920000	My doctor is very knowledgeable and helpful. She explains everything that i need to know about my lab work and my exams. I feel that I can talk to her and she listens.
0.720000	I have a long-standing relationship with her and she has been right about diagnosis and treatment the vast majority of the time. During times where I've had complications, she's made herself available to me and has been flexible.
0.800000	I have found them to be educated, compassionate, trluly concerned, and have my best interests at heart. They take the time to answer my questions and allay my concerns.
0.800000	She spends an ample amount of time with me during my visits and makes sure to answer all of my questions. She also goes over every part of my visit and blood work in detail. She also follows up with any questions over the phone. 
0.720000	I just switched my primary care doc after over 20 years so I really don't know her all that well.  It isn't that I don't trust her; she's just new to me.  Being a nurse, I do have doctors that I work with that I trust and will ask their opinion on something from time to time.
0.760000	I mean, overall I have trust.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't look for a second opinion on something life changing.  I always felt that most all Dr's know more then I do about these things.  I don't like it when they seem more interested in pushing a particular pill my way to mask rather then to look for ways to fix any certain condition.
0.480000	he is under a lot of pressure to see a lot of patients. he is always in a hurry and the medical record he refers to doesn't always seem complete for me, like what was covered in the last appointment. 
0.560000	"I sometimes feel doctors prescribe way too much medication - pushing the latest drug of choice, which may or may not be a good choice for me.  I prefer to research drugs before using them and would prefer a doctor that would respect when I say ""No that isn't suitable for me - find something else"".  but too many doctors prefer the ""take this pill"" solution."
0.800000	I trust him because in the years that I have gone to him he doesn't seem to push anything on me as far as medication and most times gives me a practical way to work with illnesses I might have.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor.  She has never given me something I don't understand and has always explained things carefully and thoroughly.  I understand enough about my diet and lifestyle to know if she gives me a medication that I probably need it.
0.800000	I have had my doctor for a while now and have been to him many times.  He has always been kind, gentle, intelligent, and informative.  I think that he really cares about his patients and me specifically so I trust what he has to say.
0.520000	I dont feel like I trust my primary care physician because she seems to force me to take shots that I dont really need and forces unnecessary tests onto me just to make a few couple bucks. But she seems knowledgeable and thats the only reason i am sticking with her for now.
0.600000	I HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A DISTRUST IN DOCTORS.  HAVING CARED FOR AGING PARENTS AND A DAUGHTER WITH HEALTH ISSUES I FOUND MANY TIMES DOCTORS WERE NOT THOROUGH ENOUGH AND AT TIMES I FELT WERE GUESSING AT BEST.  DOCTORS ARE NOW TECHNICIANS AND NO LONGER HEALERS.
1.000000	I trust my PCP because he is thoughtful and caring. He always asks about my health and if I have questions. He remembers my name and information we have discussed during prior appointments. He is thorough with examinations. He takes his time.
0.800000	I have never been given a reason to not trust my doctor and he always seems to take precautions even when he believes everything is ok.  This makes me feel better because he is not just going off of book knowledge and things he's seen in other cases.
0.800000	 do not currently have a PC. in general i trust doctors because they are more knowledgeable than i am. this does not mean i do not see the value in second opinions, however, i recognize these are trained professionals who have a better understanding of any health issue i might have.
0.720000	I think my primary care physician is really good at his job and I trust his recommendation most of the time.
1.000000	I trust my doctor completely because he has saved my life in the past and helped me to better myself.
0.360000	I am in control of my health and I like to do research on what the doctor is saying rather than blindly trusting them. 
0.800000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Over the years she has been correct many times, when it comes to my health. She has given me the best healthcare service. She has tried to improve my health time after time.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician cause they always lay it down straight forward in front of me about my conditions and the treatment options I have.
0.440000	Although my GP is most likely intends to do her correctly, with the high number of patients under her care I can't trust that she able to fulfill her responsibilities. With the private health care system dominating in a society where so many people are below the poverty line, it becomes impossible to see a GP more than once a year. If you develop any medical issue between the appointments the only option for so many Americans is to go to the emergency room.   
0.600000	I feel they are under tremendous pressure to move quickly from patient to patient as well as keep costs low and use certain prescription vendors.
0.600000	I have a rare disease called Achalasia. I was so sick I lost over 170 lbs in less than a year, doctors kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me for a year. Doctors kept insisting I had bulimia and it was all in my head, this was not the case at all. If that was the case I would have been binge eating then forcing myself to vomit, instead I would take a few bites of something and regurgitate it afterwards. After seeing over 4 specialists I finally found a doctor who listened to me and understood what was going on and it wasn't in my head. The majority of doctors I saw didn't care about my symptoms and just wanted me out of their offices. This experience made it difficult for me to trust doctors in general. 
0.200000	I don't have a primary care. In the past all they have done is make my problem worse, not better. American medicine for the most part is just another way to make money.
0.440000	I feel that my primary care doctor often does not have nor take the time to listen to me thoroughly or allow me to ask in-depth questions.  Therefore, I cannot trust that the decisions that he makes for me is thoroughly informed. 
0.760000	For the most part I trust his knowledge.  I think the problem lies in our approaches to medical conditions. I am more interested in natural drug free options.  He may not always agree but he will allow me to make my own decisions.  
0.520000	I somewhat trust my primary care physician because I do not believe he shares with me all the possible solutions to my ailments. Many of the times he prescribes drugs for something that can be healed with more natural substances. I would like to know the full range of my options, from natural to prescribed medications when making a medical decision.
0.560000	My last primary care was a DO not an MD, and would not treat menopause as a medical condition.  I had to request a referral to an OB/GYN to treat my menopause symptoms.
0.760000	My doctor has consistently demonstrated a high level of knowledge and empathy to me when i talk with them about any health conditions. I dont feel like they judge me or take prejudice with me 
0.800000	I am lucky to live in an area where I have access to qualified medical care. My medical conditions are complex; I need to be able to trust my doctors. If I have any doubt, I move on. Otherwise, I am just wasting my time and theirs.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they're very helpful. They always answer any questions I may have, no matter how silly they might seem
0.760000	"Doctors are generally good, but they only work with what you give them.  They make mistakes as well.  They ""practice"" medicine.  I know my body best, and many times have successfully diagnosed my own problems.  Doctors go on evidence and when they don't find any, they can sometimes dismiss you.  But I feel deep down, we as patients know when something is not right within us.  "
1.000000	We have built a relationship over the years. He knows my conditions and understands my thoughts and concerns about them. He wants me to be happy and healthy 
0.520000	My physician is condescending. Usually when I have questions they're met with a 'duh' attitude or as if it's something I don't need to know. I struggle with making regular visits because I end up feeling angry and marginalized. 
0.800000	I go to the doctor when I am not feeling well and when they give me recommendations it is usually something that helps.
0.640000	I trust the medical expertise of the doctor. I do not, however, trust that they are doing the right thing all the time. My doctor's office, like others, is clearly there for insurance money, making us get lots of tests.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to examine and talk to me.  My physician cares to know me as a person and takes a lot of time to ask me questions and gives me time to ask questions to make sure I understand everything.  
0.560000	Once you reach 60 and all the doctors are 30, you lose a lot of trust.  Then many doctors are treating statistically, instead of treating personally.  I take what I can get.  It could be a lot better.
0.640000	My primary physician has been a physician in my family for a long time. I completely trust that the reason he has been was because my family trusts him. 
0.760000	I have one medical condition that is rare and doctors have no effective treatment. They generally pretend to have some awareness of the condition and offer me treatment I know if not effective.  Once in a while I will get a doctor who is honest and their lack of expertise with my disease.
0.800000	I trust most doctors simply on the fact that I know nothing about it and they are train and educated to know about it. Also, some doctors just seem more genuine in the bedside manner than others.
0.800000	I trust my physician because I have checked his credentials before I have signed up with him. Also I have learned to trust him even more because my brother who is a doctor too in another country agrees to everything that my primary doctor says.
0.520000	I don't trust the American healthcare system in general, not necessarily the doctor. Nowadays, patients are just numbers to doctors. The medical care system is deeply flawed and needs reform. People aren't being treated properly for their illnesses because of astronomically high medical costs. Everything is about profit, so that's why I don't trust any doctors.
0.760000	I do not have a primary care physician that I see regularly so it is hard to say. I based my answers on the times that I have seen doctors in the past. In general I think that doctors are trustworthy and do have the best interests of their patients at heart.
0.440000	I have been misdiagnosed with mental illnesses twice. He is quick to prescribe medication and get me out of the office and on my way. One of the medications I took had negative side effects and he was unconcerned. It seemed he just recommended it for the commission cash. That medication has since been recalled. Both the doctor and his medical assistant rush through questions during check-ups. I feel like I'm inconveniencing everyone by being there.
0.640000	I am a little wary of doctors and their personal interests, and how this may conflict with my interests, but I generally feel confident in my personal doctor. He has always been straightforward with me. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor to give me the best advice that they are aware of. I do not think of doctors as gods or in fallible, because of which I do not trust them without question. I also do my own research and seek second opinions when I feel I should. I do know that my doctors want to give the best care they can provide, that just might not be the actual best care availible
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for such a long time now that I trust them. They have never done me wrong and always help me out when I have a problem. 
0.600000	I feel like most Dr's are good and want to serve their patients in the best manner possible. However, there are some that are self serving and will recommend care for what is convienent or will generate the most monetary reward.
0.800000	I facebook stalked my current doctor. I was in search of a black female doctor who was not overly religious to be my primary physician. I truly trust her and know that she has my best interests in mind because she is like me. I don't get the same feeling of controlled condescension that other doctors have and none of the fanaticism some black women are wont to have. It 's just pleasant, and I feel like big pharma cant buy her either. 
0.800000	The took an oath that I respect.  They would have no reason to not have my best interests in mind.  I do have an obligation to myself to double check their recommendations.
0.600000	I feel like my doctor takes the time to talk to me and truly understand what I need. If he didnt, I would switch doctors
0.360000	I have had some recent negative experiences with my doctor perscribing certain medications that have extreme negative side effects and my assumption as to why this medication was prescribed to me was because of the comission the doctor receives from the pharmaceutical company.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I know of their certifications and background. I have known them for a long time as well with no issues. Every time they helped me their advice has worked well.
0.600000	I mostly trust but I also know that doctors do not know everything and they make mistakes too. I also have heard many stories of people having doctors who push their own agendas or make decisions based on what is easiest and safest for them and I worry about that happening to me. 
0.440000	I just think that sometimes doctors do what is easier and convenient and time-effective rather than giving me the time and attention I may need.
0.960000	I trust my doctor, because she is very thourough, and very careful. She is ver concervative in prescribing any and all medications. Sometimes I wish she wasn't so concervative, but I'm grateful she is. Most Drs. just throw medication at you, she does not. She looks for other alternatives first, if that doesn't work, they she'll try meds, but very concervatively.
0.920000	My doctor is honest and takes what I say into consideration instead of having God complex like a lot of doctors seem too.
0.800000	I trust him the most because since I started going to his office my life has changed for the better. I feel great about myself and I think that is all thanks to him.
0.880000	I've been seeing my primary care physicians for over 5 years now.  He has never failed me in letting me know what my problems are.  I completely trust him when it comes to my health.
0.680000	The nurse practitioners have started to slowly replace primary physicians. I have had negative experiences being touched inappropriately by a physicians. I distrust their motives.
0.560000	Just started going somewhere new and haven't really been that impressed.  They seem to rush through and don't explain things in as much detail as i would prefer. 
0.800000	She seems to have my best care in mind. Also she has taken care of all my questions with care.  Andshe consults with the other professionals in her network. So she has earned my trust and I hope to continue in her care.
0.760000	I have issues sometimes with the doctor's staff doing things to make my treatment more difficult. They sometimes do things against my doctor's orders.
0.800000	I trust my doctor for the most part because he has never given me any reason not to. Everytime i do go to my doctor, he usually is very helpful in figuring out whats wrong and solving it. He also never tries to get me to take any medications  that will have bad side effects, and is really compromising in all aspects. 
0.600000	I mostly trust doctors, but complete trust has to be built up over time.  And doctors are people too and make mistakes.  I believe they try to do their best, but sometimes they are working with limited information - I don't always remember to tell them everything.
0.440000	She acts as if she cares more about her world than mine. Sometimes she seems closed which discourages me in wanting to contact her about my issues 
0.840000	Doctors train for a huge part of their life. They are incredibly knowledgeable and determined to provide the best care for their patients. I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
0.760000	I have developed a great deal of trust in him over the many years I have been seeing him. My father recommended my doctor and because my father is a physician , that made me trust him right away. 
0.960000	I have known my primary care physician for awhile and he is a family friend. I believe that he does everything he can to make sure I am getting the best treatment possible.  Not only for me, but for my whole family since he is all of their doctors.  He seems to take his time and is always available for questions.
0.880000	I've thankfully had good experiences with doctors. I don't need to see doctors often, but when I do I have received care that I had been satisfied with. I feel that the doctors I have seen care about me, they care about making sure I understand my issues and they explain to me the importance of my options and the results of any decisions I make. I have not felt at all that doctors don't care for me or that I am wasting their time.
0.800000	I have never felt any reason to not trust my doctor. I feel as if they try and do their best to figure out what my issues are. Until then, I will trust them.
0.840000	I completely trust my primary care physician. She is a kind, considerate and thorough doctor who shows genuine concern for her patients.
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because he has helped me find treatment for things when I have gone to me and given me advise on how to treat things in a helpful way.
0.800000	my primary doctor has been working with me for a few years and he is one of the best doctors i've ever had.  he is soft spoken, tells the truth but in a polite way, is an excellent listener, and has a pleasant attitude.  i have no reason not to distrust him; he hasn't lead me in the wrong direction yet.
0.520000	I feel that I have complained about the same symptoms for several years and only recently has the dr started to listen to my valid complaints. I understand that people have a magnitude of problems, but getting answers is very important
0.600000	I trust my doctor because they have more knowledge in that field of study and in the pains i may be having but i don't trust them to make the best recommendation for me when deciding between home remedy and hooking me on meds for profit; and benefiting from my insurance company. 
0.680000	I often feel like the doctors are overworked and they have to rush between patients, so they only spend a few minutes with you. This isn't really enough time to be thorough and careful despite how good their intentions might be. I don't have a problem with communicating to the nurses, but I sometimes wonder if all of the information is actually being conveyed to the doctor or not.
0.600000	I've met many rude doctors in my short life. It seems like there are may people that become doctors for the wrong reasons. When I find a competent and compassionate doctor it almost seems like finding a rare gem. I think most of them are competent of course, but few have what it takes to interact with patients appropriately.
0.720000	I completely trust my physician. The main reason why I completely trust my physician is because I have been going to the same physician for ten years now. I feel like my physician knows exactly how to treat my symptoms. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physicians to do what they believe is best and affordable for me given the knowledge they have. That said, one can not be an expert in every specialty and sub-specialty so I do expect to be referred to a specialist if necessary.
1.000000	I have certain things in common with my primary care physician. He routinely vacations in an area I am familiar with. My doctor speaks English, and there are no cultural barriers between us. He has a good sense of humor and is, generally speaking, a very nice man. I like him as a person, and I trust his judgment. 
1.000000	I have brain tumors. That diagnosis came totally out of the blue and I was devastated. I ended up with the best doctor, and he saved my life. And he also made me understand that things would be okay. He moved away to teach not long ago, and I've saved his last voicemail to me just because hearing him always makes me feel better about life.
0.400000	i often have to seek a second opinion because i don't think my doctor really understands my problem. she is good for easy things, like a flu shot or antibiotics prescription, but i would not trust her to correctly diagnose and treat a more complicated issue.  
0.600000	I trust them as much a I distrust them. I  am not a paranoid person but I would like to understand what medical procedures are being done on me and what the effects will be.
0.480000	The physician i see most often is my pain clinic nurse practitioner. I see two different guys and they contradict each other at least once every two months. It is hard for me to trust what either of them say because neither seems to be interested in healing my problem, only covering up or masking the problem. We have reached a wall and the only other option that could be recommended would be surgery but one physician feels I am too young and not in enough pain. Nothing either of them have done has worked to help my pain so it is hard for me to feel confident in any of their suggestions.
0.720000	the doctor profession is a divine profession, I have great respect towards them, they know our body situation better so I trust the doctors verymuch
0.760000	"I see no reason why my pcp would not be honest with me.  I go to a practice where I am seen by residents and interns overseen by attending physicians.  There are plenty of ""checks and balances"" in place to ensure I am getting quality care."
0.560000	I feel that the business side of things makes it really hard for doctor and care give to give the best service as possible. I think they are push to see you longer then they need to and add on service that you really don't need. I think that they are good people but I think that management get to involved in health care.
1.000000	I trust my PCP because I have been going to see her for a long time and I know she values me as an individual.
0.800000	My doctor is very personable, friendly, and honest.   She does thorough tests yearly, gives me all the details and takes a much time as needed.
0.680000	My primary care physician has led me astray before, and a substitute doctor almost killed me. I had issues with my gall bladder and my doctor did not catch the signs of that happening, even though I was making appointments for a knee issue. Also, my knee issue was misdiagnosed as well. She did do a good job telling me all the treatments available for my knee issue, and she did diagnose the arthritis in my foot accurately.
0.720000	I haven't had that much medically wrong with me through my life. I had my tonsils and adnoids taken out, we thought I had a hernia when I was in junior high and one bout of skin cancer a few years ago but other than that, it's pretty much been colds, flus and bee stings. I've never had a problem with a doctor. I've never had a doctor lie to me, or at least, I've never found out about it. I generally trust people and that holds true for doctors as well. 
0.400000	At this current time in my life I do not have a primary care doctor so I would be discussing doctors in general as a whole. I feel the training they received from medical schools is geared towards treating symptoms and prescribing medications and not curing the issue. This would be due to Pharmaceutical industry having such a firm holm on lobbying the medical education system. Doctors need funding and will do what is needed or asked in order to get said funding. It is a business and that means the end user/patient is not always going to be the focus of concern.
0.640000	She is personable and competent, but like most doctors, she prefers treatment over prevention. She is not always interested in the root cause of something.
1.000000	I think my doctor really cares about his patients, as all should. I've never once even gotten a slight implication that my doctor wasn't doing what was best for me.
0.960000	My primary care physician makes decisions where we both have input in and both discuss what is best for me; he doesn't make a decision for me, we both work together. 
1.000000	"My doctor has spent time during my visits to listen to everything I say. He listens to me like a therapist. He will even call me from his cell phone after business hours to discuss test results as he gets them. He's always been very thorough in explaining medical conditions and terms and treatments. He always ""fixes"" me quickly."
0.760000	I have been with my doctor for many years, he has done a great job taking care of me. I have no reason to mistrust him or suspect some hidden motives.
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician for a few reasons. For one he is an excellent listener. I often over think or over worry and he puts up with it. He offers a variety of medical options when issues arise and he is always knowledgeable on these options. This makes me trust the he is making informed choices for my health.
0.440000	I trust most doctors I go to I normally go off of their attitudes, I dont like a doctor that doesnt show compassion or caring, thats how I rate a doctor.
0.680000	I trust my doctor.He has always come through for me.He has never steeredme wrong. He has always helped me with my health and known the right things to do.
0.560000	I trust and do not trust my doctor. I believe that they will do their best to help me. Although, I also think that they might add in unneeded tests just so that they can get more money.
0.840000	They have been through extensive training in the subject area and certainly at the very least know more than I do, and have no reason to want to deceive me
0.400000	I have had the same issues for years the the Doctors never can find anything wrong.  It is extremely frustrating!
0.600000	I get a general vibe off my instincts on how I feel I should feel about it. There are some doctors that I trust and some I do not on that alone. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I trust my doctor because he has a degree and went through a lot of tests to ensure he knows what he is doing and is good at it. He see's a bunch of other patients who also think highly of him which is what in return I trust and believe the same about him. He has a lot of education and does a lot of good things in his profession.
0.640000	I want to trust my doctor, or any doctor. I sometimes have a hard time doing so though because all-in-all, it is just a profession and if these doctors fixed all sick people and issues happened less and less, doctors jobs would become more and more scarce so some things are not treated properly or correctly so that it can keep people in the healthcare system to make money and keep doctor's jobs.
0.240000	Doctors in general: They are narcissistic, arrogant snakes who care more about their country club membership payments than patients. I repeatedly have received misdiagnoses and inadequate when it comes to doctors such that I now view them as a means to an end--the end being the laboratory test results and that's about it. Dr. Google has served me far better than any doctor ever has.
0.800000	When i go to the doctor they listen to everything I have to say.  They answer all my questions.  They will also ask any follow up questions that they need answers too.  They don't rush through the appointment.  they take all the time that is needed by me and by them to come up with a solution to whatever the problem is.
0.480000	My doctor is intelligent and easy to open up to for the most part.  But sometimes I feel rushed.  Sometimes I feel she is a bit condescending or quick to jump to conclusions.  I generally feel she is not as thorough as I would like.  I supplement the visit with a lot of internet research.  I mainly go to her for basic checkups.  It's very hard to find a doctor who you really like, who listens to you, who doesn't rush you, who you trust, who you feel comfortable talking openly with, who is non judgemental, who takes your insurance and continues to take your insurance, who gives you good answers to your medical problems, who has a competent and caring staff.  In the end I think most people settle for someone who meets some of those characteristics.  Or maybe they just stay with a doctor they are unhappy with.  Sometimes you can't always find what you want.  But I do think the medical professionals and the insurance industry should do a lot better.
0.760000	i trust my doctor because he treats well and gives all the information i need. whether its good or bad. there is an app where all the lab reports are uploaded directly and he has asked me to log in to it so that i dont feel anything is hidden from me
0.760000	He/She has a full record of all my medical history at there fingertips.  They can order new tests and/or labs easily which can often be done in the same facility.  I have had one doctor before moving for over ten years which enabled him to get to know me a bit personally which I think helped the overall care.  This facilitated discussion on lifestyle and care out side the clinic. Often, they new colleagues in the same medical plan that would be a good fit for me in other areas of care such as back doctors or physical therapy.
0.480000	Well, because unfortunately doctoring is a profession, and legal practice if you will. Therefore, there is a certain amount of accountability and responsibility that they must exercise, therefore I may come second to that.
0.880000	She takes time to concentrate on my problems and my needs. She always offers me the best advices and guidelines
1.000000	My doctor has always been very well educated on any problems that i've had. He is very intuitive and understanding and will always give me an honest answer regardless of the situation. His dedication to his patients has been simply amazing.
0.800000	For me, it is because I was his office nurse for 28 years, so I know him very well.  He is a good doctor.  I did not always agree with everything he said, but as a patient or as an employee, we could still work it out.
0.520000	I always feel that I am rushed when I go to the dr. The usually ask a couple of questions and make there decisions that way instead of examining or running test.
0.920000	"I am a ""Type 2 Diabetic"". I know that my doctor must get frustrated when my A1C count is high. He does not give up on me for not trying my best to control it. He still gives me advice on how to eat, exercise, and not give up. "
0.560000	I trust that my doctor can provide basic care and advice but I do not believe they keep up-to-date on new treatments.  I'm also not confident in their knowledge of things outside their specific scope of practice.  As with all professions, some doctors are very good and knowledge an a majority land somewhere in the middle of competence.
0.720000	Usually my appointments are so quick I feel like they just want to get me in and out of the office as quickly as possible and are annoyed if I ask too many questions
0.720000	I go to a medical professional for their knowledge and expertise. If I don't feel comfortable with the information or advice, I feel confident in my own ability to seek a second opinion or read up on treatment options.
0.560000	As to doctors in general, I don't trust them completely because they will often do what is best for them rather than what is best for the patient. For instance, they may not prescribe a patient with chronic pain the right medication because they don't want to prescribe certain drugs.
0.800000	I feel comfortable with her.  I believe she has the same philosophy as me as to healing holistically vs. medically. 
0.760000	I trust them most of the time but I tend to not rely too much on their answers when it comes to what medicines to prescribe. I was told by another physician that many doctors have contracts with certain pharmaceutical companies, and because of this they are persuaded to recommend that company's medications, even though they know it won't fix their pain or conditions. Since they have a contract, they are forced to push the company they have a contract with's products over others. 
0.760000	So the surgery went incredibly well with only one nurse having poor bedside manner. The issue was the follow-up procedures. Radiation was all set up and ready to go before a sudden visit to the oncologist was scheduled. And we were informed that we were a month behind schedule. After that, suddenly radiation had to be pushed back over two months so four sessions of chemo could be forced through. We don't go to the first surgeon/general practitioner anymore. Apparently that's common with most surgeons: once they're done with you, you yourself don't need help anymore, even if you clearly do.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician implicitly.  If I did not trust her, I would find another doctor.  My doctor is caring and always takes the time to discuss all of my questions about my health.  She is not an alarmist.  She always remains calm and is not upsetting regardless of the health issues that are needed to be dealt with.   
0.560000	I have neutral trust of my doctor. While I do believe he primarily acts with integrity, he will spend 20 minutes lecturing me on healthcare issues that I'm not there to address, leaving the real needs unattended. Namely, he spends the entire explaining to me that I shouldn't drink at all, ever. In return, I lie and say I don't drink. 
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I know a lot of other people who see her too.  Others in the medical field have told me how good she is too. 
0.560000	the doctor seem to rushed to be totally trusted. He sometimes seems to have made a decision very early in the process and ignores evidence as I present it. he is also under pressure from insurers to provide the low cost options. there I have been times when I have mentioned more modern thinking or treatments and he was unreceptive.
0.800000	My doctor is fairly new to me.  I have only seen her a couple of times.  So far, I feel that she is trustworthy and has explained why the need for certain tests and paths of treatment.  She is educated, warm and very friendly
0.240000	"I've been through 3 primaries in the past 4 months, trying to get diagnosed and treated for hypothyroidism. None has been a great experience; the first one was very hard to reach, the second ignored my question about additional tests (I left a message with the receptionist and never got a return call), and the third, while explaining one part about how insurance works that the other two should have done (they all knew I'd been out of the ""system"" for more than 20 years), also ignored a question I left with a receptionist. I'm not sure whether I will stay with her. At this point I feel like there is no such thing as a good PCP."
0.680000	Again, I think that the main reason is my inability to 'self-diagnose' and communicate my concerns with them. There is also something of a mistrust of the system within which they work as there are so many constraints upon doctors due to insurance coding and coverage. It seems to interfere with their ability to offer care.
1.000000	"She has always been correct with her diagnosis.  Most people would rate her low, due to the fact that she takes a lot of time with each patient, so her wait times are in the hours, at times.  However, she is spending quality time, with each patient.  Making sure she doesn't just, ""put a Band-Aid"" as a solution but she tries to find out what is causing the issue.  For example, my husband went in with a bloody nose, she didn't just give him medicine, she spent time with him and did tests to figure out why his nose kept bleeding."
0.240000	My current Primary Care Physician is not even a physician.  She is only a nurse practitioner.  Every time Iâve gone to see her she has literally said âI just donât know what to tell you.â  âIâm not really sure what is going onâ.  After she did some research online, she came to the same conclusion that I already had by searching online.
0.640000	I distrust most doctors because I believe they are mostly concerned about money.  Most of them don't care how your health really is.
0.800000	I have been seeing my pcp for the last 20 years.  he is kind, thoughtful, and smart.  He sees his patients as people, and has a full understanding of their needs.  He is an amazing doctor who has actual conversations with his patients.
0.760000	They take the time to listen to me and explain what they are doing and thinking. Sometimes they are rushed, but overall, I think they are doing well.  
0.680000	my doctor is very friendly with me and i relate to him as a person of similar age, race, and gender. we seem to get along almost as friends
0.640000	I often feel that doctors have their own agenda when it comes to diagnosing patients. After all the medical field is for profit. To that effect, I am cautious about completely trusting doctors. 
0.800000	My doctor has over thirty years of experience practicing medicine. This gives me a lot of confidence in his ability to care for me. He is very caring and through when treating any medical condition that I may have. I trust him greatly.
0.600000	I belong to a family care practice. I only go once a year for monitoring of my condition. Each time I go there is a new doctor right out of medical school assigned to me. The old doctor has moved on. It is hard to generate trust if the old face has gone somewhere else. 
0.800000	I trust most doctors because they are highly educated and have much more knowledge and experience than I do on the subject.  I do not trust some of those I go to because I am in the military and some are just HMs who have not necessarily been to college let alone medical school and could be lacking in the right information.
0.960000	I trust her because she is a very honest person. I have her cell number and she is always abvailable.
1.000000	I have a lot of trust in my doctors. Case and point was last year when I wanted to change my birth control. I was on the pill and wanted to have the implant in my arm. My doctor came in before and went over all the other types of birth control and all the benefits and side effects to all of them. Once we got through that and I still wanted the implant she proceeded. While she was putting the implant in I asked her why she asked all those questions even though I scheduled the implant. She said she felt people didn't look at all the information that is out there and sometimes people don't know all the different options they have. She wanted me to know and understand all my options before going forward so I made the best decision for myself. 
0.640000	Sometimes I feel they are only in it for the money. I feel they might order something that I do not need done or some other added expense for no reason. Usually this is not the case and they are usually out for my best interest but I feel they sneak a few things in there. I can usually trust my provider to get me the help that I need and that they are being honest with me and careful to treat me right. 
0.400000	I have had way too many bad doctors in the past. I literally had a doctor look at my mom when I was 5 and tell her it wasn't if I got cancer due to my family history, it was when (while I was sitting there). After that, I started having anxiety about going to doctors and my health. I was severely overweight and another doctor told me to run and eat less. I wasn't physically capable of running. My knees were damaged. I have never been able to trust a doctor to look out for my health. 
0.520000	I appreciate everything that physicians do for their patients, although I sometimes feel as though certain doctors are motivated to perform a particular action because of personal financial gain. That, or sometimes certain doctors do not show a great sense of genuine interest towards their patients.
0.640000	In general I trust my doctor, that being said I know that s/he has a heavy case load and i may not get all the attention i need. Also I know that insurance, HMO's and pharma influences decision making/medical advice i receive
1.000000	I have found my primary care physician to be a very good listener who asks pointed and relevant follow up questions. He also takes into account my experiences with various medicines and treatments when prescribing tests and/or new medications. 
0.560000	I don't like spending money to see a doctor when I am not sick. I avoid hospitals at all costs because of the associated costs. I won't see a doctor unless I'm really sick/in immense pain.
0.520000	I have not been with her long, but certain things have fallen through the cracks, like orders for follow-up tests. She's also not show much curiosity in helping me identify problems.
0.800000	I feel like if they have been through so much schooling, I should trust them as long as they keep up with new medical findings.
0.520000	My doctor and I disagree about pain management.  I would rather live with some pain and not be on pharmaceuticals, and he thinks it makes more sense to take pharmaceuticals to reduce (but not eliminate pain) despite negative side effects.  I think many doctors don't understand what it really means to manage a chronic pain problem.  Taking pills everyday is not everyone's first choice.
0.760000	I do trust my primary care physician basically because she has never given me a reason not to trust her.  I think she is kind and caring, and she has never misled me in the past.  She has been helpful any time I have gone to see her. 
0.640000	I do trust my primary care physician but I also don't feel like I get very personalized service. I feel as though I get a generalized service saying that I have basically the same issue as other people. 
0.800000	I like to give physicians the benefit of the doubt.  I have never been steered wrong yet.  I bet there are a few crooked ones out there but I have not encountered them.  I like to think people are more good than bad.
0.520000	I feel like most doctors just write prescriptions for whatever condition you may have and things like diet, exercise and more holistic options are not given to the patient. I would trust my doctor more if it seemed like they knew more about things other than drugs. 
1.000000	My doctor has always been very upfront and honest with me about my physical condition and what treatments I need to take even if they might not be what I want.  He always asks about my well being as about my family and will even recommend me to seek other consolation if it is beyond his expertise. I consider him a friend as well as a doctor.
0.440000	The way the laws are setup in this country I feel doctors have to tiptoe around certain issues. For example, If I am in severe pain I feel they would try as many remedies as possible before offering me pain medication due to the stigma the FDA puts on doctors who prescribe them. I feel like a criminal just asking for help with severe pain. If this is how they treat me with that one issue, what other issues are they making worse to protect their own license?
0.800000	I feel that my doctor is typically very attentive and does a thorough job. However, there are times where it feels like they might be rushing a bit. If I ever had something serious going on, I would definitely seek a second opinion so I do not blindly trust my doctor. 
0.360000	Alot of doctors care about making more money not about peoples actual needs. As in they make money off of giving prescriptions. You see so many people taking medicine. People dieing faster off taking medications prescribed by the doctor.
0.720000	They do have more schooling then I do and they continue to learn about different diseases and treatments. The one's I have seen pretty much put everything straight out there for you, they don't dance around the subjects and the sometimes admit they don't know what's wrong instead of just trying to label you and move you along. 
0.920000	I'm not a big doctor person. If I can solve it, fix it and feel better on my own then I'm going to. I like my primary care physician though because he understands my nerves and does his best to calm me down. He's been practicing for over 30 years so I feel confident that he has expansive knowledge. His office is modern and high tech, so I feel he keeps up with the times and is up to date with the latest procedures, drugs and treatments. He's always available on call and has no issues coming to the hospital to check on his patients all hours of the night. He's a family man and very trusting. I'm 100% happy and secure with my care in his hands.
0.640000	I have had a past where there have been some missed diagnosis. Because of this I do not always trust they they are taking the time to get the job done well and make sure they are doing the right thing when it comes to my health. 
0.240000	I do not trust doctors or really any kind of medical professional.  In fact, most of the time they don't even seem that professional at their jobs.  From my personal experience, it seems like doctors are only concerned with getting each patient in and out as quickly as possibly so that they can see more patients which of course lead to the doctors making more money.
0.960000	I have never had a problem with any medical advice he has given me.He has always listened to what I have to say and answers any questions I have.
0.760000	I trust my doctors because they went to medical school and I did not. So I believe them over myself.
0.560000	He always seems busy and I have had him misdiagnose something to where I had to return for a follow up and  different treatment due to him not spending the time initially.  I am currently searching for a new DR. 
0.760000	My primary care physician has changed often lately, so this is more about physicians in general.  For the most part, I trust their decisions:  they are trained professionals with a lot of experience in their jobs, and many are also active research scientists.  However, they do have some pressure put on them by drug sales representatives to recommend one product over another, and I think that there is a possibility of their judgment being distorted by drug and other medical product marketing techniques.
0.600000	I sometimes don't trust my doctor because of her negative reviews that are public on Google. However she is usually kind to me and tries to suggest what her opinions are rather than making it sound like that's absolutely the problem. She tends to prescribe me something to see if it helps and tells me to come back at a later date if the problem still persists. 
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because he also took care of my mother while she battled a terminal illness. We became close with him during that time and he did a lot for my mom. His care went above and beyond and that has made me trust him very much.
1.000000	My doctor has always proved to be a trustworthy person.  He's been very helpful to me.  The one time something was very wrong with me, he attended to my needs in a thoughtful and respectful way.
1.000000	I like my doctor and I can relate to him. He's a very funny guy, uses humor to relax his patients and to communicate.  It works!  He gets to the heart of the matter quickly.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician in that I believe that he will have my best interests in mind while not trying to rush me out of the door to see the next patient.
0.800000	I feel that my doctor does not have any reason to lie about something. I also know a few things myself and can tell by my doctor's body language. I am able to research the doctor's advice myself and compare it.
0.640000	I trust my Primary care physician for the most part, however, if he were to put me on a drug of some sort, I'm not sure he would be open to exploring all drugs used to treat a condition, or if he would choose the drug that he is comfortable with, or the drug of the sales rep that brought in lunch that day.  Overall, though, I do think he has my best interests at heart and wouldn't do anything to harm me.
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because he also has experience in alternative medicine. He takes in consideration that you are a whole person(body,mind,and spirit). He is honest about what your options are when he tells you the symptoms. .  
0.920000	I trust that my doctors are following the oath they made to do no harm. Additionally, I believe in science and believe that the doctors who have years more training than I do are far more capable than I am in this regard. However, I do think that it's important to tell them when you are experiencing side effects etc. so you can get a treatment that works for you. 
0.560000	The doctor that I have now pushes the medication option.  My previous doctor did the same.  I know they are doing the basics for me.  But I'm not that good a patient and I don't always follow their orders.
0.480000	I do not feel like my doctor is committed to getting me the best treatment. I like my doctor but I don't think that she views me as much else than an insurance claim.
0.640000	I trust my primary care doctor because they know there stuff. They went to school for a long time to know all the stuff. If they mess up they are gonna hear it from me.
0.800000	I feel like she takes times with me and really tries to understand what is going on with me. She asks me a lot of questions. She never rushes me. She runs a lot of tests if necessary. If she can't find answers she refers me to someone else. 
0.800000	In the past, I have not trusted my physicians. I felt they did not take the time to follow through with care.  My current doctor is thorough and seems to care to exhaust all possible ways to figure out to make me feel better and also seems to notice how a patient feels at the time of the visit
0.800000	I feel comfortable talking to my doctor(s), and if I have questions or concerns I don't have a problem asking. Also, if there are side effects I ask about those, or potentially alternative treatments. I have always felt that my doctor was able to explain things in a straightforward way that I understood. 
0.800000	I would rather select slightly agree but that's not an option. I've only been seeng this doctor for over a year. About 4 visits because the doctors sometimes rotate or finish their residency. I have to be my own advocate and never completely trust someone with your life in their hands without doing a little of your own research first.
0.640000	I do not have a primary physician, but I did have a cardiologist in which I seen somewhat often. For the most part I trusted him with the tests he authorized for me to do to find out what my condition was before coming to a conclusion because he went to rule everything else out before I received my diagnosis. I generally trust him, however I know that doctors do not work for the welfare of the people, but the welfare of deepening their pockets. The old doctor vow was to help people and to recommend dietary changes to promote health and well-being. Now it's about their contracts with Big Pharma and prescribing poisonous and toxic medications to create a lifelong patient and to create more money for themselves. In general, I believe my doctor's intention were in the right place, but I'm fully aware of the scam and can see through it all, so I generally do not trust them.    
0.440000	I feel like doctors always rush through appointments. I feel like a lot of times they act like I'm making it up.
0.520000	I often feel like They do not full understand that some treatment options although a little safer might cause more of a daily issue for the patient. My physician also shames me on things that I can not control rather than offer help
0.480000	I honestly don't have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I say that mainly because I haven't had a lot of interaction with him. In addition to that my interactions that I've had with him have not been really positive. I've felt rushed in those interactions and I don't get a sense of him really caring about well being of his patients.
0.560000	I trust my doctor because he fully listens to me. I never have a problem with my doctor listening to my worries or health concerns.
0.920000	 My primary care doctor had shown diligence in researching ways to help me personally. She knows my conditions and is careful to address all of my concerns. I trust her because she's earned that trust over time. 
0.440000	I distrust my primary care physician because one time when me and my sister both went for a check-up, he prescribed both of us potassium pills. I was living on campus for college at the time and had a completely different diet than my sister back at home. It was strange that all of a sudden, we both had low potassium. I ended up not taking mine because mine were huge pills that were a capsule, and I have a hard time swallowing pills. I just ate a couple bananas for a few days. He never prescribed them to us again.
1.000000	He is always warm and welcoming, very professional but he smiles enough to not make me nervous. The top reason I'm happy with him though, is because he actually treats me when I am ill, before I had him I ended up with shingles, and my current doctor (back then) told me that I'd have to tough it out. I switched to him immediately and he got me the medication I needed, he even had his office call me to see how I was feeling. 
0.680000	I think that your doctor should be one of the most important people in your life. If you do not trust your doctor or if you do not have that bond with your doctor, then I think that you need to find one with which you can form that bond with. I think trust is the number one thing between doctor and patient. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they always take the time that they need in order to help me, even if they are backed up.   They never rush me.  They make sure that all of my questions are answered.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is thorough, kind and takes ample time to explain everything that I need to know. 
1.000000	I like and trust my PC physcian because we actually discuss my issues, treatments and options, I can bring up ideas she has not brought up and we can discuss them, she is open,  I can make my decision based on my needs and she is supportive.
0.400000	I feel that my doctor, who is nearing the end of her career (upper 60's) and thinking about retirement in the next year or two is no longer placing my needs first.  I think she's having some sort of compassion fatigue and it doing a lot of things that are easier for her rather than giving me the proper care I am paying for and deserve.  I've gone to this doctor for over 20 years and it's difficult to see this happen however, I think the end of this doctor patient relationship is near either due to her impending retirement or me finding a replacement prior.
0.720000	For the most part, I think doctors are trustworthy. However, they are very busy and see a lot of patients, so they could make mistakes, just like everyone else.
0.720000	I feel like I can trust my primary care physician because I do not sense that he would provide bad advice.  I do sometimes have concerns because while his intentions are good he might not be aware of every condition or treatment option.  Sometimes I feel like seeing a specialist is the best alternative.
0.800000	I generally trust my primary care physician because outside of the fact that he's gone to school for a long time to be a medical professional and knows a heck of a lot more than me, he also seems like a good person, who actually cares about his patients. The only reason I don't have complete trust of him, is he's still human, and humans make mistakes. Even Doctors.That being said, even though I trust him, and the diagnoses he may make, or the medication he may put me on. I'm still going to do my own research on the topics at home.
0.800000	There are a few people in my life that I have to give complete trust to and my doctor is one of those people. He just comes across to me as being knowledgeable and sincere and I have the real impression that he is doing the best he can with the situation that presents itself. 
0.920000	After numerous doctors that could not diagnose my conditions, I began seeing my current internist 5 years ago. After our first meeting she called me numerous times at home, sometimes in the evening to discuss past medical she found in my records. She always made time for me and what she could not do for me, she referred me to specialists where she monitors my care with each. My life and health are better as a result.
0.600000	I have had many bad doctors. I use a mouth guard during the day for stress, and doctors have treated me like a mental patient. Many doctors have refused to treat my infections because they have treated me before. My immune system is bad. I have had doctors call the police on me and lie, saying I hear voices and want to die. I never told anyone that. A majority of them have been bad. 
0.600000	In general I do think that doctors act in the patient's interest and would at least put a good amount of stock in what they tell me.  But at the same time I have my reservations about total trust.  Especially the more serious the medical situation is, the more likely I would want other opinions.  But for routine things, I figure the doctor knows how to handle the situation.
0.920000	My primary care doctor has been in the medical profession for many years and is very well-respected in our local community.  He is direct and honest, and open to ideas about my and my family's treatment options. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician as they have done a really good job of diagnosing me and getting me the care I need so far. They have helped direct me to people that were able to help me with things that they were not trained to do (specialists) and in a very short amount of time. They have been able to help me with my scoliosis and have always been very positive. 
0.960000	I love my doctor. Any concerns I've ever had, he has listened to me carefully and has given advice when he can as appropriate. He is genuinely concerned about my well being. He likes to laugh and makes jokes when I see him. He seems happy when I come in for my check ups. He has never steered me in the wrong direction. He looks me in the eyes when we are speaking. He can gauge if I'm having not a great day just by the responses I give him. He's a great doctor and I completely trust him!
0.960000	I have been using the same doctor for over 20 years and have experienced a range of issues in which he has guided me well and with great empathy and no judgment. I have had no reason to question his judgment as he has been very wise and when he has insufficient knowledge, has directed me to people who have uniformly been knowledgable. We know each other well and have a great history.
0.920000	I try to have any issues I want to discuss written down and keep to a max of three things, if possible.  He always makes sure I am up to date with any shots I am suppose to have.  He tells me things for my own good health care.
0.520000	i know that doctors are experts, but they are often wrong about things. sometimes they dont listen to what the patient is really telling them.
0.560000	In general I almost never just trust one opinion from one physician. Specially if they are older as there is a chance that they are not up to date with the information (speaking from personal experience). I prefer always getting a second opinion and do my own research to learn as much as possible.
0.800000	I trust them as I have had them since I was about 7 years old and know them very very well. They are more like family at this point, for me. .I am grateful for this as they are a good person and very helpful to me. 
0.320000	I do not always have trust in my doctor because they always try to prescribe me medications for every problem that I have. I think that if they took the time to listen to me and understand my symptoms then I would achieve more of my therapeutic goals rather than having to try new medications every few weeks. 
1.000000	My doctor takes a lot of time and effort to explain my conditions to me. He gives guidance for modifying my diet in connection with my medication. He also gives directions to appropriate resource persons. He also provides scientific literature regarding my condition.
0.760000	He has a lot of medical knowledge, and he cares a lot about his patients.  Most recently I went into see him to get a small internal bump in my inner thigh examined.  After he gave me a physical examination, he determined that it was not cancerous and posed little risk as he thought it was a cyst.  He gave me multiple options:  do nothing, an ultrasound, or surgical removal.  The fact that he gave me multiple treatment options shows me that he cares about my needs, and I am grateful that he puts a lot of the care decisions in the patients' hands while taking to explain the pros/cons of different treatment options.
1.000000	I've been going to the same GP for over 11 years now, so he knows all of my medical history and suggests what I should do to better improve my health. Usually he knows right away and can diagnose what is wrong with me when we talk and i get treated in a quick office visit.
0.720000	My doctor is a good and caring doctor, and I do feel he has my best interests at heart. However, I can tell he is busy and overscheduled.
0.680000	I trust them because I have to, they are the medical professionals and as long as I give them all the information they need they should be able to tell me what's wrong. I distrust because they are in business to make money as well. Medical world is big business and driven by insurance company's and their reimbursements 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because we have built a solid relationship over the years and there is mutual respect involved. He will tell me the truth whether its easy to hear or not, and he will listen to hear what I need to do better. 
0.720000	For the most part doctors seem to want to help but they don't all have the time to spend with you to really figure out what is wrong. They usually go with the easiest course of action, which I understand is commonly the correct one. But, I cant tell you how many times people have had to go back multiple times just because the treatment they were given was for something they didn't have.
1.000000	I generally don't have any complex conditions and usually only receive preventative screenings. However, when I was pregnant and seeing a doctor on a regular basis, I do believe she had the depth of experience regarding my condition and trusted that she would provide great care for me. I followed her advice and believe my pregnancy had no issues because of her care.
0.760000	I have visited a lot of Primary Care Physicians and finally have one I trust. He is extremely knowledgeable and great at answering any question no matter how small. She gives me multiple treatment and medication options and lets me decide what path I would like to take.
0.840000	If I go to a mechanic, i assume he knows more about cars than me.  If i go to a physician I expect the same.  I am in no place to tell the doctor how I should be treated medically.
0.840000	Doctors seeing lower income people don't get reimbursed well. Medi-Cal reimbusement rates are dismal and doctors aren't getting paid to see these patients. This means less doctors come to the area and we don't have a wide enough incentive to bring in high quality doctors or even keep them well paid or keep their buildings looking nice. Their surroundings seem lower tier and they often have too many patients since there aren't enough doctors. The doctors I've seen required travel. If a doctor gets recommended by someone else, I'm more trusting of the doctor. While there are some red flags to some people, I've never had an issue with an doctor at a clinic or a big hospital. They've always been able to guide me to a solution.
0.600000	I feel like they rush through my concerns and questions.  Explanations can be in excess or too little. I havenât found a Dr. I really like in awhile.
0.560000	I don't trust some doctors because they are on a higher pay grade and tend to have an eminence of superiority.  Don't get me wrong, some doctors are great, they seem to want to help.  To others I may feel like another cattle being strung along and they don't care if I end up in a dazzling meadow or at a slaughterhouse as long as they get their payment. In my situation (chronic rhinitis) I often have to asking prodding questions to really get any help on my issue.  Everything they have recommended hasn't helped at all, they say the cyst in my sinus doesn't matter, my jaw being realigned with palatal expander/braces doesn't matter, both these things seem like something worth investigating more, but they don't.  Sure I think they probably know better, but I don't count 100% on it.
0.640000	There might be lots of factors why a primary care physician make certain decisions. There could be influence from the practice to meet a certain quota when invoicing. Drug companies often have 'agreements' with practices so their products are preferred in the treatment of certain conditions. Sometimes practitioners are under time constraints so may opt to try a treatment for something non-life threatening and recheck later to assess response
0.640000	I generally trust my current doctor, and I think she's a lot more trustworthy than the ones I've seen before, and she always takes extra time to explain things to me and walk me through my health plan. However, I've only seen her a few times over the past couple of years, and I don't completely trust her yet. I guess I just have an ingrained distrust of doctors when it comes to prescribing medications due to previous negative experiences with them disregarding the side effects I was having and pushing medications on me that were not essential (such as birth control pills and certain sleeping pills).
0.600000	I have no issues with my current primary care physician. However, in the past, I had a PCP that was not very attentive during my yearly physical examinations. This resulted in my performance anxiety condition to go undiagnosed throughout my childhood until finding a new PCP later in life. 
0.800000	He is a family doctor. He been In the family for twenty years. He is always right with his diagnosis and treats my family according he feels like a family member .
0.720000	I generally trust my doctor.  I know he is looking out for my best interest.  I typically try to avoid the need for any medications to take regularly, and I do believe there are problems with certain medications that are pushed on patients.   
0.520000	I usually go to a clinic, so I never know which doctor or NP I will see. I like some of them, they go over everything with me. Some of them it seems like I only see for a minute, and then they leave the room before I can ask any questions.
0.800000	I generally trust them when there is no incentive to skew the truth. Even in that case they aren't lying they just aren't giving the best solution. 
0.720000	I have no reason not to trust these people. I would also expect someone to trust me in my profession just the same.
0.480000	I do not have a primary care doctor. I rarely see a doctor. In my experience doctors always have bad news so I really don't have much trust in them. When my husband was sick there were a few doctors that were honest and thoughtful but the majority of them seemed disinterested and made the wrong decisions because they did not take the time to get updated on his condition.
0.680000	I have a great general physician, but I typically like to research my conditions and then review options with my doctor before making a decision. If I disagree, I seek a second opinion. 
0.800000	I have complete trust in my doctor. He's never done anything to upset me. He listens to me and is very patient. I have had to switch my children's doctor one time though. I did not agree with her many times and she hardly seemed to check out my kids, I did not trust her at all. 
0.560000	My doctor seems pretty neutral. The last time I went in, I had a question regarding this rough itchy spot on my skin. He didn't look at it and asked me if I've tried any over the counter steroid creams on it.
0.760000	My doctor has been a doc for over 25 years and has always given the best options available for what my ailment has been. I trust her whole heartedly 
0.720000	A doctor is only one person, and sometimes people make mistakes. It's also impossible for one person to have all the relevant information about an issue. My doctor is competent and I like her, but I always do my own research to verify what she's saying. I like to get multiple opinions, so even if my issues aren't serious enough to seek out a second opinion in person, I'll at least do my research.
0.640000	I trust him because he has given me good direction with my health. He is a little blunt so at times he has hurt my feelings. However, he is a good doctor and has given me good medical care for years. I just thinj he needs to work on his bedside manners. He has been my family doctor for years. I trust his judgement on medicines and whats best for my overall health. 
0.560000	I trust that my doctor would provide me with the best care that they thought was possible if there was a real serious concern about my health. I also feel that my doctor does not always listen to every symptom and she is only trying to get through her day. I think my doctor prescribes medication to easily and doesn't always look to see if the benefits out-weight the side effects.
0.840000	I have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I have been with my primary care physician for almost my entire life, so we have had plenty of time to develop a good rapport and a good relationship. I trust her with my concerns and with explaining things to me so I can understand them
0.840000	My doctor spends a good amount of time in the room with me, 15 to 20 minutes or more, talking with me about any issue that I am having. She listens to what I have to say and does what ever tests are needed with out hesitation. She also felt a lump in my breast that turned out to be breast cancer.
0.680000	My PCP has never steered me wrong. She doesn't take chances. She sends me for testing when she thinks there is something that does not look normal. She is very honest and doesn't sugar-coat anything for me. I appreciate her honesty very much.
0.640000	My doctor spends more time with me during check-ups than any doctor ever has. She continues to ask questions, give me tips and pieces of information I wouldn't normally expect, and will even bring up questions regarding other possible issues I have to ensure there is nothing being missed. She truly listens to everything I say and never seems like she's rushing to get to the next patient. I feel she really does care about my health.
0.440000	I have a rare illness that my Physician had never heard of, so his choices in my care have not always been the right choices. I do see a specialist that I trust a bit more, but overall I am very discouraged with most of my healthcare providers due to their lack of knowledge or willingness to educate themselves on my conditions. 
0.640000	I have a nurse practitioner and trust her and doctors in general. However, I think it's important to educate ourselves on our condition and possible treatments. Doctors and care providers may overlook some possibilities. We have to keep in mind that they are seeing many patients and we have our own health, and maybe our family's, to look after.  
0.720000	I've been going to my doctor for a few years, she has a good way of explaining things and listening to what I have to say. She answers questions thoroughly. I also checked her on the list of doctors who accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies and she doesn't accept those gifts.
0.560000	In general, the medical profession is run by corporations and pharmacy companies who are as interested in a profit as they are anything else.  Individual doctors and other medical personal may be more interested in a patient's care, but the institutions themselves are a different matter.  A government intervention is doing nothing to make it any better.
0.720000	I don't trust medical doctors very much. The reason is because I feel that there is constantly contradictory medical advice and I think that many of the practicing doctors were taught information that is now old and they are stuck in their ways. I would much rather have a young doctor than an old one because old doctors are mostly ignorant to advances in science and how to treat illness before it comes on.
0.720000	For the most part I trust him.  I don't think by any means he would want ill for me but occasionally when nothing seems urgent it feels like his patient overload becomes more important then my concerns.  Also sometimes I wish he would give more thought into different treatment when I may not be comfortable with what he was suggesting. Seems like first idea and his idea is the only idea.
0.520000	unfortunately I have to say that most physicians I have seen firsthand didnât give me the most trusting feeling, although I can't say I wasn't cared for but I feel a lack on the care system. As mentioned before, most prescriptions are given based on symptoms and 'guesses' and not on facts, or exams. I do give attention and value to what my primarily physician says but I never see situations as a one way street so I do my research. And sincerely get disappointed if I look for help and medical guidance and am told that nothing is wrong without any testing done. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear versus what I may want to hear. Hearing those true facts allow me to make sure I am aware of the decisions that I choose to make. I believe it is important to gain the trust in the doctor, so they know what your background story may be. Most times it is best if they share their own story to make myself or the patient feel more comfortable. this allows me to open up more to them and tell them whats writing frequently. 
0.800000	My doctor does not have any hesitation in telling me how it is with my health.  If I balk at doing something he is suggesting he will be very blunt on why it has to be done.  He has never steered me wrong, I trust what he says.
0.800000	I've little choice in the matter really. My trust would have to be in the institutions that educated the idividual(s).
0.720000	My doctor is a little impersonal so I dont distrust him but I dont trust him fully either, sometimes he very attentive and other times he is apathetic and doesnt give a care about me so its hard to decipher which day he is which.
0.800000	Generally the doctors I've had give the impression of compassion and empathy, and at the very least, they seem knowledgeable and confident.
0.840000	I have been going to my doctor for a very long time now. When ever I have a pain or any other problem with my health I head over to his office. With my major back pain issues he has always been stright forward with me. Always telling me the truth straight to my face even when I might not like it. He has always been correct about the cause of the pains or illnesses. His procedures and getting better plans have had a one hundred percent rate of effectiveness and I have always gotten better when I follow his instructions. I trust him because he gets things done correctly.
0.280000	In the past four years I have been given a misdiagnosis three times because doctors failed to ask the appropriate questions or perform a simple bloodtest.  I spent months in excruciating pain while doctors scratched their heads and did nothing but prescribe medications that did not help and in fact made me feel even worse while my fingers were literally dying.  I could get a shower without literally screaming and curling up in a fetal position afterward.  There is no painkiller that can help that level of pain.  I am quite certain that if they had bothered to check my thyroid levels that I would not have endured a level of misery that makes one question what quality of life is worth living.  I have no trust in the competence of doctors because most are apathetic due in large part to the healthcare system itself.
1.000000	My primary is part of a medical group that is responsive and communicative. I find throughout my health needs they explain all tests, procedures and issues. If I have questions I can call any time. Plus they have an excellent online presence for appointments, access to records, payments etc. 
0.480000	I do not fully trust my primary care physician because they have such a busy and hectic job.  How could they possibly always be able to perform well under their stressful work conditions?  They see patients for such a short time and it's hard to think they could always be right about what condition a person has, and what drug will make them better.
0.840000	My primary care physician seems very thorough. I think he pays attention and he knows his stuff - he seems to know what he's talking about.
0.560000	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I always like to question my doctor though. Itâs part of my nature.
0.560000	I have several friends in the medical profession and the horror stories they have told me, as well as the life or death situations some of my less healthy friends have had to suffer because of poor care at a hospital, has tainted my view of the profession. Medical Error. Overwork, Carelessness, Corporate Pressure, Ignorance. It's all a big problem. 
0.640000	If I don't understand something, I ask my doctor to explain it to me.   Afterwards, I usually follow up and research the issue more.   Rarely is my doctor incorrect in their explanations. In addition, they are able to provide referrals to good doctors (those respected in the community). My doctor also surrounds himself with competent staff.
0.880000	I come from a small community and there have been several times that myself or a family member has been in for one thing or another and it would not be uncommon for our Dr. to call the home phone or cell on his time off to see how we were doing and if something was not right he would meet you at hospital or even your home, all on his own time.
0.560000	My doctor seems to be on a timer. I don't feel he wants to spend any extra time because he has so many patients or whatever. The last time I saw him in November 2017, he more or less lectured me that I need to lose weight. My A1C was 7 so he appeared upset. I had a short visit and I'm scheduled to see him again in March of 2018. I may cancel the appointment.
0.800000	My primary care physician seems genuine and thoughtful. She listens to all  my questions and never seems to be in a rush. She seems thorough in her examination and is kind.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very smart, well qualified, and she knows what shes doing. The office that I go to is also very well known, and its been around for years so I trust them. They are all very professional, clean, and enthusiastic in their practice their.
0.880000	My doctor took the time to answer all my questions. My doctor followed up with me and sat down with me one on one for as long as it took for every concern. She is very kind and did not make me feel like I was burdening her. She called me and made sure I was okay after a procedure and made sure I did not have any other questions she could help answer. all in all she made me feel very comfortable. Even the nurses were very prompt in returning calls and making me feel like I was the only patient they had. I hope everyone has the same experiences I did during that difficult time. 
0.200000	I donât think some physicians are open enough to modern medicine or understand the muscles and skeletal systems in the body or how we can hold so much internally. Some are more open minded then others.
0.800000	I have known my primary care physician for a long time and he has always been honest with me. I have never had an incident where my doctor lead me wrong or caused something negative
0.800000	Physicians are in their career for a reason and a lot of trust is involved when they are helping patients out. There is a relationship that builds
0.800000	After a few problems with doctors ignoring my concerns (I spent years with a vitamin deficiency b/c the doc would order bloodwork and insisted it was all in my head) I found an extremely thorough doctor that listens to me. 
0.800000	She takes her time with me. She listens to what I say and even to my suggestions for treatment  If she does not know something she gets more info for me. She is totally honest with me.
0.840000	My doctor has been very helpful by working in conjunction with me to address any health issues that I have had. She listens to my concerns and understands that I am an involved patient. Because she listens to my input, I trust her to work with me toward responsible health goals.
1.000000	They are passionate about what they do and took an oath to uphold a certain code to protect people in every way that they can.
0.720000	I trust doctors but only as far as I can throw them. There is still a line of distraction in them, and that they do not exist inside of you. You still need to be informed and ask questions 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing this doctor for twenty-plus years. He always takes the time to explain things and ask questions to understand what is going on with me. I always get the proper treatment for whatever ails me.
0.800000	I trust the doctor I have now because he listens to me and is willing to do a large number of tests if necessary to find out what is going on. He doesn't regard my symptoms as something unimportant. If he can't figure out what's going on he refers me to a specialist in that area. In the past my doctors would act as though they didn't need to listen to me because they already knew what was happening. They wouldn't order tests, so it took me much longer to be properly diagnosed. 
0.880000	the most doctors are very skilled and human, so in this way, all of them are very trustworthy and helpful to their patients, and i have complete and total trust on what they say
0.760000	I trust her because she trusts me. I feel that I can talk to her honestly, and I expect her to be blunt in return. Most recently, she was worried about my cholesterol level but I was reluctant to go on new meds. She agreed that I could try to bring it down with lifestyle changes, so she gave me some diet tips instead of a prescription. With changes in diet and exercise, I brought it down 53 points. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because they are very professional, experienced, and knowledgeable. They have never done anything detrimental to my health.  
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a very competent and experienced medically trained physician who is familiar with various illnesses and treatment options who seems to care for his patients..
0.600000	I think doctors get rushed by office managers. I also think insurance reimbursements to doctors are diminishing so the doctors are having to see more people in the same amount of time and this results in subpar focus and attention. I also think doctors get into a 'groove' and tend to prescribe the same things and give the same diagnoses without giving extra thought to if there is more going on than it seems at first. 
0.960000	I have been with my primary care doctor for more than 8 years. I have also had 2 major medical situations and he has guided me through out the processes. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor mainly because he has very good listening skills and is attentive to my needs and concerns. He is most easy to talk to and never attempts to talk over my head. Even though he is a young physician, I feel most comfortable with him. I do not usually get stressed out when I go to my physician. I can't say that I really look forward to getting and sick and needing my physician's care, but at the same time, I do not dread having to schedule a visit with him.
0.760000	"I do not have a primary care physician, however, I did have to go to a doctor recently (possible kidney stones). He was a good doctor who, although busy, took the time to listen to my concerns and symptoms while keeping a ""playful/positive"" attitude. He treated me as though I was perfectly competent in my descriptions/concerns and, while listening to me describe my symptoms, stated what possible things could be causing my symptoms, and finally what he thought it was most likely to be. He was genuinely concerned about my comfort (I was in extreme pain...but I was a champ) and wanted to make sure the pain levels would be decreased before I left the office. He sent me to another doctor for a CT scan and, after I explained I don't have health insurance, made sure that he found the best payment options/route for what I needed done as opposed to just charging me one set rate. I trusted his opinion and appreciated his compassion and humor. In general, this has been my experience with most doctors...busy, but compassionate."
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because they have a degree in medicine, and has seen many others like me with similar issues in the past.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician is because I've been with him a very long time. He is very thorough and honest with me every time I go to see him.Therefore I trust him completely.
0.920000	I have had my Doctor as my Primary Care for over 10 years and he is very open an honest with me and  very straight forward, he doesn't pretend just tells me straight and that what I like.
1.000000	"I work for a world-renowned health system with some of the best doctors in the US. I always look to see where they attended school, I have access to their ""heath scores"", and if I have to I'll ask my boss, who is the CEO.  They were able to diagnose that I had an autoimmune disease that usually takes 12 years to diagnose."
0.880000	I rarely go to the doctor because I am in excellent health. when I do have to go, I feel that the doctors that have been assigned to me always take good care of me and don't let me leave not knowing what is going on with my health or if there are any health concerns. this in turn gives me the optimistic and trustworthiness of my doctors that I can go into a health care facility and not have any regrets. I don't feel that the doctors at any time are looking more for convenience for them, than my actual health.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he tells me the whole truth about my health.  there's no sugar coating anything and he gives me all of the best available options for helping to continue to be in great shape.  All of the advice he's given me has worked, so I will continue to trust in his advice and recommendations.    
0.400000	It's rare I visit with a doctor that seems genuinely concerned or one that assumes his first diagnosis isn't correct. All seem to be THE expert. Some seem tired of the repetitiveness of their practice. And most seem to prescribe a specific, expensive drug, when there are other options available.
0.320000	I can never get a straight answer out of him. Every time that i go to the doctor feeling bad he tells me i have a virus or just tells me that he isnt sure what i have, but he will still prescribe steroids or antibiotics. Sometimes i worry that i may have a serious problem that wont get fixed because he doesnt put the proper care into figuring out what is wrong with me.
0.840000	My Primary care doctor has always been there for me when I have questions. I can communicate with her via email and she will see me if I really need to come in with almost no advance notice.  She explains things well and cares if I  am OK.
0.560000	Some time it feels they dont  believe you what you telling. Or they seems like they so busy  and have not much time for you and spending much time with computer not with the patient. 
0.800000	I didn't have a primary doctor for quite a while because I didn't think I really needed one.  I had to get a referral to see a neurologist, so I saw one recently for that.  She was so nice and made me feel very comfortable.  She compared some digestive issues that I'm having to problems that her daughter is having and gave me good advice on solving the problem. She seemed very down to earth and trustworthy.
0.560000	When it comes to doctors in general I will trust their ability to identify a problem. What I do not trust is the ability to prescribe a solution to a problem.  Most doctors solution to most problems is by prescribing a drug even when a problem can be resolved with simple diet and exercise. This is the main reason why I will not trust what the doctor prescribes  but will trust his diagnosis.
0.720000	Are usually trust my doctors about 80% you can truly trust them 100% because some doctors do make mistakes and thatâs why itâs always a good to always ask a lot of questions and if you have any doubts get a second
1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician, they genuinely care about my well being. If I have an issue, regardless if it seems minor to me, my doctor always insists for me to make an appointment. My doctor possesses the proper credentials and has board certification.  
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician primarily because he has always taken the time to listen to me when I have had health concerns and discussed treatment options and recommendations with me. He discovered that I had a heart condition when I was 40 that I had all my life, and he sent me to a cardiologist,who was impressed that the doctor say it on my EKG. He has been careful about prescribing drugs unnecessarily, but prescribes medicine as he feels necessary. He even takes time to answer health questions I have when I am with another family member for an appointment. 
0.840000	I trust that my doctor is looking out for my best interest as I could give him a bad review otherwise.
0.840000	Before I choose a physician or hospital that I would go to ER visit I always check the reviews and I always do my research and up to now I've had great confidence with all the positions are hospitals that I have chosen
0.360000	My primary care physician has many many other patients and very little time, is constrained from making definitive statements, and is affected by the pharmaceutical companies they receive benefits from, their insurance, my insurance, and their own social personal and religious biases.

0.760000	I trust her because she listens to me and genuinely wants to know how i a doing. She suggests things for me to try that fit with my lifestyle instead of pushing pills on me. I appreciate that she isn't rushing to go out the door and listens to what I have to say. She is thorough and has a lot of knowledge in the things i need answers about. Plus one of my illnesses she also has so I get that extra insight.
0.880000	I generally trust my doctor as they have gone to medical school and see many things that make it so they learn a great deal. At the same time I do like to look into things myself.

0.720000	I am generally trusting of doctors but I do like to do some research on my own as well -- forewarned is forearmed.
0.760000	I dont really have much of an option to not trust my doctor. If i didn't trust my doctor, then i need to find one that i can. Besides that, i feel that they are the expert in their field just as i am an expert in my field. They should know what they are talking about and if they dont, they should either tell me they dont, or find someone that does.
0.720000	I haven't seen my primary care doctor all that often and usually when I do it's for pretty straight for things such as a broken arm or a physical. In other words, it's hard for me to quantify my trust in my doctor because I've never been put in a situation where trust can be questioned.
0.280000	"I do not trust my doctors because I have asked them simple questions sometimes and they give me the most basic answer so they don't have to waste their time answering me properly. Example, I asked what type of blood I am and the response I got was: ""Oh, now the type of blood is no longer as easy as a letter. It's complicated. It's a number of letters and numbers. Don't worry about that."" Also, my doctor put me on the wrong treatment once and it lasted for months. "

0.760000	I trust my doctor because we communicate effectively with each other. If we don't communicate what is going on or on all the different treatments available than I would not have as much trust as I do today.
0.640000	They just leave me alone for hours then they get mad when you ask questions . They get angry and rush you out.
0.520000	Not all doctors Are authentic in their reasons for going into a helping profession and are money focused

He insists that any problems I experience are related to my lifestyle.  He keeps  me on a low fat diet, limited alcohol, and a regular sleep schedule.  The only medication he gives me is for my eczema and sleeping pills that I should only take occasionally.  I'm instructed to return to him if I need to take the sleeping pills more than occasionally.  He gave me a nighttime routine that should help me get to sleep.  Long conversations and reviewing my blood pressure history, he discovered that my blood pressure is up only when I don't get enough sleep; so rather than blood pressure medication he wants me to get enough sleep.  
0.840000	Because he is experienced at his profession and also he knows what he is doing and also he knows how to treat his patients 
0.840000	Some things i can trust about physicians but mostly not everything is to be believed. Doctors give u things to suppress ilnesses but not get rid of it. Its all about keeping us sick. So no I dont trust doctors. I trust in the Lord Jesus Christ only! God of Abraham, Isaac and Joseph.

0.720000	I trust my doctor because I feel comfortable. I can ask questions and have an open dialogue with him about any medical issue, concern, etc
1.000000	I have complete trust in my doctor. This is mainly because I have a long history with this doctor. I also go by my gut feeling that he puts the patient first and not himself. He shows his passion in his job and does not mope around the clinic. To me, that means it's not all about the compensation. Anytime I had an ailment, he knew right away what prescriptions and directions to give me, and they all worked. I also trust my doctor because he gives off a calm and reassuring vibe. If I had to choose among doctors, he would always be my pick.

0.560000	Although I may respect and trust my doctor's opinion, I also have into account the limited amount of time he has with me, and the fact that I am an individual and not everything will work the same for everyone. While he has the ability to be medically informed, I know my own body and sometimes doctor fail to listen to their patients. I make independent inquiries and do my own research about medications prescribed and won't hesitate to stop taking a medication that is giving me undesirable effects/reactions.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because they have never gave me any false information about my medical issues and health information 
0.800000	The reasons why I trust and distrust them a little because health care for profit can get in the way
0.560000	doctors are human and make mistakes. they are capable of misdiagnosing conditions, prescribing the wrong medicaions. they use staff that overbook patients so that you don't see a doctor. they over prescribe medications ,they push samples that you don't want to try because big pharma gives them perks for doing this practice whether the medication is right for you or not.

When I meet with her, I feel comfortable discussing anything that may concern me and I feel confident that she will provide me with the best answer and advice that would benefit me.
0.800000	I always trust my doctor she has never turned me in the wrong direction always explains things and has got my health under control

0.880000	myself and my doctor have developed a great relationship and I trust him. until he gave me information to believe otherwise i will continue to trust him.
1.000000	I trust my primary care doctor because I am best friends with them and if they lie to me they will get in trouble.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he gives me options. He also tells me I don't have to do anything I don't want. So with that being said I really trust my doctor. Alot of doctors just tells you what needs to be done so they can collect the pay and mobe right on to the next patient.  My doctor takes his time and make sure I'm comfortable with the decision that I come up with or he tell me how much time I have to decide on decision. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he does not hesitate to tell me when I am doing something wrong and the risk of doing that and he will also tell me what I am doing right and praise me.
0.800000	I have a doctor that actually cares about people. The entire practice cares about doing what's best for the patient and not what's going to be the most profitable or the easiest option.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they are well studied in the medical field for treating me and providing prescriptions.They have a lot at risk if they don't provide the right information.
0.640000	I am more apt to trust a doctor willing to listen and entertain my ideas as well. I don't want a doctor willing to take the first shortcut because that is what suits them.
0.840000	I have been going to my doctor for the last 20 years and I completely trust her, she is reliable and trustworthy 
0.840000	I trust my doctor. I can talk to her about any and everything. My doctor always takes as much time as needed with her clients.

0.760000	I feel they can be trusted most of the time, if not I can at least get an insightful opinion on something. Besides not being helpful could cost them their job. 
0.360000	Who Sunil Endo shul think to do you  think homophobic to do check bunko stay stuff tho do dunno dunno syrup yup dunno affecting full full full full
0.560000	I understand that doctors go to school and years of experience but sometimes they can still be wrong. So I do not put my trust in doctors but I put my trust in God.
0.680000	I don't she would tell you just anything for money. Alot of Dr's have had problems for just giving any information. She was highly recommended , so I think she gives good information. She explains everything . Her assistant is very thorough too. They are up to-date on new medications and procedures. She hasn't given a reason for distrust.
0.600000	I don't trust anyone I don't know. Now if they were family and I knew them well then yeah. But anyone I don't know

0.440000	honestly I believe that most doctors are only in it for the money and only in it for their own interests
0.680000	I trust her because she has more knowledge than I do on medical situations. I have slight distrust because sometimes I feel she rushes with patients and just gives the easiest solution instead of taking each individuals health differences into consideration 
0.240000	It seems that doctors rarely truly listen. They think they know everything and they should never be second guessed even though the field of medicine is still growing and learning and the physician didn't seem like they listened in the first place (but they know). Usually whenever I have a question they never answer it satisfactorily and without taking any tests and/or additional tests (for questions about my health that would require additional tests that no physician would know otherwise).
0.720000	The explaianation and reason why I trust my primary care physician is do to her character and understanding. I feel she is an honest physician who truly wants to help.
0.800000	i do trust my doctor i have to hope he is giveing me  all right answers .you never whant to fell he's not
0.840000	I have been going to him for a while now. I Google him & looked at reviews on him. All reviews were excellent on him. 
0.680000	well i should trust the person that went to study to become a doctor and they should know what they are doing honestly or they are in the wrong field
0.720000	So far I haven't had any problems with my care physician.  But I don't someone's word without getting a second opinion. 
0.840000	I trust the right kind of doctors because they know whats best of me healthwise and the right kind of medicine
1.000000	My care has been extensive, satisfactory, informative and tailored to my and my health conditions thus far.  My doctors make sure I have all I need my medicine, information, care, treatment, tests, annual care.
0.400000	I have had a personal, plus three familial situations in which--two if the times, two different family members almost died because if a lack if thoroughness and misdiagnoses. I myself was mid handled during a very high risk pregnancy. Each of these times, I mystery of, was forced to tell the doctors what I felt should be considered it done. I must add, that all three if these instances did not take place at my preferred hospital, UVA, where I wish all three of us would have been treated.
0.680000	I feel that yes my doctor may be giving me the best knowledge about my health to the best of her ability, but she is not God who is the ultimate physician. So therefore I can't trust her word.
1.000000	He is takes time to explain my care plan and why certain test are necessary  he he is attentive a compassionate 
0.880000	I always trust my doctor unless I have a gut feeling that's something is really wrong with me then I will go get a second doctor to look at me
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she is trustworthy. I've never been giving a reason not to trust her. I don't like going to the doctor that often tho but I trust her

0.400000	I have been hospitalized recently and no one was telling me anything except I had to stay in the hospital.  I had four specialist and none could tell me why.
0.760000	I trust my dr. But I just feel that sometimes you need a second opinion which i find nothing wrong with that.
0.920000	The doctors I've gone to are usually right. They've never given any reason for me to not trust them, and they've always been honest with me, even if I didn't want to hear it.
0.760000	my primary care physician  is honest can do the things that i asked for them to do also trustworthy with me.

0.640000	I don't know if physicians as a group necessarily know or care about giving their patients the best care.
0.520000	Doctors cut corners. I know because I am one, and I have done so. So I wouldn't be surprised if my physician made mistakes because of that. 
0.480000	Some doctor's are in it for the money and some doctors really do care. I believe insurance has a lot to do with it to.  I feel doctors, don't like dealing with uncovered patients.  I believe if we had universal insurance, Doctor's would be more understanding, if there wasn't a price tag attached to every person.  If every Doctor could look at every person, the same, and treat each person accordingly healthcare would be in a better light. I think the health care field needs to have guidelines securely in place pertaining to ethic's and morals.  I think it would make a great differences.

The first OB/GYN was trying to force me to have a c-section for no reason, the second didn't support unmedicated birth and my chiropractor implored me to change to a midwife because she specializes in pregnancy and found that her patients had more success with midwives for unmedicated birth. I also had a doula and the birth was still tense due to the overbearing OBs in the practice, who almost forced me to have a c-section as well. Thankfully my doula was there to fight for me to get the birth I wanted.

0.440000	My primary care physician is good and better than most.  I believe that, in general doctors have become salesmen.  They are very quick to prescribe medication and refer patients to doctors to patients who refer patients to them.  I do not feel that anyone should completely that in these days of greed and avarice, no one should blindly entrust his/her healthcare to another human being.
0.200000	I have complete distrust for doctors in general. Some things are not thoroughly explained to where I can understand what options I have in regards to making the right decision for my health. My former OBGYN sped through his answers every time I asked him a question. It's like a didn't have time to think or make a decision. I was trying to decide what my best option is for birth control and at the end of the day I ended up not making a decision. I was so upset with my whole visit with the doctor in general that I have to choose another OBGYN. I was actually referred to the former OB.

0.680000	I primarily trust my primary care physician because I have made a relationship with my doctor.

0.840000	I have been going to my primary care doctor a long time and usually what she recommends turns out to be very helpful.
0.840000	My doctor has been very good these past three years in helping with my health issues. I received referrals to help with two issues. My doctor prescribed medicine for my needs. My doctor also stressed the urgency of taking my medicine.
0.480000	In American society, doctors are too easily swayed but money. I don't trust them to provide me with the care I need if I don't have insurance or the amount of money that want. It seems so odd that we have to buy our health, like the common man is owned but the powers that be. 
0.560000	I think many physicians are conditioned to think and behave a certain way, whether that stems from training or peer influence and sometimes cannot be ooen to seing beyond that field of view which can be a detriment to patient care as well as the representation of the medical field as a whole.

0.880000	"My doctor has been a ""lifesaver"" on several occasions for. Without him/her I don't know if I would have survived without my doctor and some divine intervention. My doctor has always answered my questions to my satisfaction and fully explained my issues. When my doctor thought that I needed a second opinion there was a quick referral."
0.440000	I don't believe a lot of drs continue to study about new medicines and treatments that are available.  It is difficult to have faith in someone when that is the case.  Not only that, how do you really know you dr is a good one?
0.720000	well sometime they have best heart for me and sometime I  feel like they don't when I feel he or she is giving the wrong information
0.200000	They really don't take the time to talk with me nor make me feel like my needs and concerns are being heard.

0.600000	I trust and do not trust primary care physicians. I trust them because they are the experts at what they do and then I don't trust them because I know they will say anything to charge and get more money out of you.
0.520000	A lot of MDs think that they are Gods. Holier than thou..not interested in the patients cares or needs..just their agenda..i dont trust all of them

0.680000	I trust them with the family and friends and family and friends and family to the hospital and I will be there for a while to get it from the other day when 
0.640000	Sometimes doctors are under time constraints and don't have the time to thoroughly explain things to their patients
0.800000	My doctor listens to my concerns and answers my questions thoroughly. My doctor also provides health information as needed.
0.760000	I have honestly only seen my doctor a few times and it was after I had my child and what I like is that she is personable and takes her time making sure I'mâ well taken care of

Personally, though, I hate going to doctors and actively avoid them, because I am an extremely private person and don't want to share personal and sensitive information about myself, or to be physically examined. For this reason, and because I am generally well-educated myself, I strongly prefer to avoid doctors and make personal health decisions on my own whenever possible."

0.560000	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples. 
0.800000	They are not perfect and can make mistakes. A second and third opinion is best. My goal is not to say anything about the other doctors and see if each says the same thing.
0.480000	Dr Barbie seems competent for the most part but sometimes she ignores information that I give her because it's inconvenient. Once I persist she usually comes through but why do I have to justify legitimate concerns?  If I had any doctors that weren't as arrogant, I'd change, but I haven't. At least, she prescribes what I need instead of forcing me to stair step through options that don't work
0.640000	The only reason why I have some distrust in my physician is because she is quick to prescribe medications sometimes and isn't the best at explaining all the side effects and that makes me not trust her to the highest extent. She is pretty good overall thats the only issue I have with her.

Her office was to small and she constantly had drug reps there. I know that she was very busy but I think she needs to learn how to schedule her patients and not have them sitting for hours just to see her.

1.000000	Because I routinely ask probing questions about their opinions, medications, and treatment options. I rarely make up my mind about a Physician until I seen then on multiple occasions. Occasionally, I research their background and consult other physicians about their reputations.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician. Although I might not always agree with his or her diagnosis, I have their trust and mine theirs. I would not go to a physician who I wouldn't trust. I need to feel comfortable talking about anything with my doctor.

She is a great listener and allows me to make suggestions.  She also takes the time to explain things and doesn't treat me a just another patient.  She asks the right questions and gives great advice.  
0.680000	For the most part, he seems to care. He seems to be very smart and thorough. He has made good judgement when it comes to my health care. He seems to be knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. He has a calming effect on me. I like his personality. 
0.560000	I take what any doctor says with a grain of salt.  I do not see them as gods or absolute authorities.  I do respect their knowledge, however I blend it with my own knowledge as well.  I'm the only one who has lived in my body all my life, therefore I am the authority of my body.
0.840000	They show that they care I never have trust issues they explain everything to me that I need to know and answer all questions
0.600000	Doctors do not all have the same opinion. Best to always have a second opinion, or third. At least I would do this.

0.640000	Doctors or primary care physicians often rush their patients. A visit is too quick to get to the bottom of one's needs. 
0.600000	because it is in his own best interest to what would best for me. This what he has trained for and has taken an oath to do what is best for his clients. so I believe he would do what is best for men.
0.800000	My doctor is upbeat and personable.  She is younger than my previous doctor who was wonderful.  I trust her because she looks out for my best interests and does not insist I take drugs that I deem unsafe.  She is very knowlageable and competent.
0.560000	I don't necessarily trust doctors. Some are very trustworthy, others are not trustworthy at all. Doctors are often more caught up in imposing their ideas on their patients and don't actually listen to their patients. Too often they tell women that losing weight will fix all their problems or that they can't have a hysterectomy, even when it is medically called for, because they might want to have children later. Too many of them have relationships with drug companies that make it hard for them to be fair-minded about which treatments are best. Some of them haven't kept up with the latest in medical science news. 
0.720000	I just that my primary Care physician is well educated on the subjects at hand i mean he doesn't have a degree for nothing right
0.720000	mostly trust but no one is perfect and dont hold them to 100.  If they do get something wrong or if they cant do what I expect then I can flex to what they are thinking or doing at the time
1.000000	I have been going to my doctor for over twenty years. He's the best doctor I have ever had. He will always tell me the truth about my health conditions and what kind of treatment is needed for them. He will then let me decide which one I want. He never suggests a treatment that I do not need. The two times I have gone through cancer, he was extremely helpful and caring. At appointments, he always takes his time with me and other patients. In other words, he does not rush through them as some doctors do.
0.640000	I have rarely had any issues with my medical treatments that are recommended by my doctors.  They seem to know what is best for me based on my medical history.
0.680000	Because Doctors do care about my health and for my whole body to feel much better.Sometimes Doctors don't care or didn't do a good job when it comes to asking so many questions and Got me upset, about something.that's awkward.Doctor's are there to find out what's going on with my health and to learn about me getting the help I need.

0.840000	I trust her.. cause Ive had other doctors.. and shes now a female which und erstands my needs alittle better... and always gives me her open and honest opinion.. 
0.600000	Sometimes doctors do not take the time to really look at the whole picture and just prescribe what is common for a condition
0.760000	You should always trust your doctor to give you the best care you can receive. Doctors are not there to purposely harm you, they care about you and want the best for you. Not every doctor will have the right answer but you should still trust them 
0.320000	i read my medical documents, and they are two-faced, call my condition fake, reason that I lost my disability.

0.720000	I have a reasonable amount of trust in my primary care physician, but I am not afraid to ask for and make sure I get a second or sometimes even a third opinion if I dont agree with what my pcp is saying.
0.760000	My Dr. is caring and compassionate. He will try to help people to the best of his ability. He takes time to listen and talk to his patients even when really busy.

1.000000	I had a really bad bout of panic/anxiety attacks over a year ago and that's when I reached out to my nurse practitioner. He has helped me through this whole process and still to this day. He is always there when I need to contact him and I have had to try a few different medications until I found the one I am on now (Paxil). He has helped me to understand everything I am feeling and has helped me make a complete 180 in my life. I am forever thankful for my nurse practitioner. He pulled me out of a very hard time, and it was something at the time, that I knew nothing about. So that was also scary to deal with at the time. 
0.800000	I trust my doctor because in the past she has encouraged me to seek a second opinion, she has done what she could to avoid surgical procedures (even though eventually it had to be done), and she always gives the most minimally invasive options.
0.480000	The doctor I've been seeing is mean and ignort. Can't ask him questions and get scared to say anything at all around him. Even his nurses look like they Dont want to ask anything
0.640000	I think doctors for the most part are very knowledgeable and truly care about their patients, but I think that the way our healthcare is run, doctors don't have enough time to fully develop the best plan of action.
1.000000	he knows what he is talking about tats atatdr is all that i can think of at this time isaid that it is
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he understands my needs and listens to what I am telling him.

0.440000	He has his head in his laptop more than he looks at me, he doesn't talk or explain things anymore, I am changing doctors soon.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician so it is impossible for me to answer the above questions. For that reason I had to answer neutral.

0.840000	I chose my doctor, for good recommendations, good studies in a university that I trust and good results
0.800000	My doctor does not seem rushed when she is with me. She is calm, takes her time, and explains everything.  If I have questions, she answers them fully. She never makes me feel stupid for asking any questions, and never makes me feel like she needs to get on to the next patient. I feel like I have her full attention. 
0.800000	My doctor has years of training and real live experiences.  He know more about my medical issues than I do
0.560000	I have a lack of trust with my GP.   She recommends one thing while my gynecologist, neurologist, and allergist recommend other avenues 
0.840000	she is the best out there, i know because we live in a small town and everyone knows everyone so everybody knows my doctor she is thoughtful explanatory and super nice
0.800000	i trust him but im smart enough to research things outside of the office to make sure he is correct in what hes telling
0.800000	Because she has been kind and compassionate with me for many years.  She is easy to talk with and confide in.
0.400000	My doctor misdiagnosed me for two years. When I found out what was wrong with me he refused to listen. I hired an attorney and had him send a letter so I could get a referral to a neurologist. They agreed with my self diagnosis. Same thing happened with my GYN and my chronic problems. They could do a google search and help me but their fucking egos or laziness stops them.
0.960000	My PCP has invested time in understanding my medical history and general health.  She is thorough and careful in explanations, such that I believe I have sufficient information to make necessary decisions.  She takes a whole-system approach to health, and will check in with my preferences for, e.g., pharmaceutical vs. alternative treatment for an illness or injury.
0.840000	I have know my primary care physician for 15 years and have never had an issue with how she or her staff have treated me. She is also my wife's primary care dotor.
0.600000	I trust my doctor for the most part, but sometimes feel he takes the easy way by throwing medication at me even if it has a warning attach to it. 
0.680000	They sometimes just give pills to cure a situation without getting to the root of the cause.  They don't have time to discuss a plan that would work for me instead of pills.
0.560000	I think most doctor's have the best intentions but are rushed or pressured by external forces (billing, administration, etc) to make decisions that aren't always right.
0.760000	They are sincere and experienced, but would like to make a lot of money with my visits, which I do understand but most of the time the outcome is generated office visits.
0.560000	I sometimes trust and distrust doctor. I have had a bad experience when My mom passed away due to A doctor sugar coating things for my mom many years ago. He did not give her guidance or answer any questions about her illness, thus I have many trust issues with any doctor. Including dentist or a nurse. 
0.800000	Because he tells me truthfully the best course to take and it is always right and leads me in the right direction.
0.760000	HE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT  ME, IS ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND NOT IN A RUSH TO GET IT OVER WITH. NOT AFAID TO TELL ME I SHOULD LOST WEIGHT AND STOP EATING CERTAIN THINGS

0.720000	Some I trust some I don't. All depends. There's honest to God willingness to help while others just want to milk the coverage plans
0.760000	My first visit was her questioning me about my health in general and if I had all the necessary test up todate?
0.600000	I trust them to know a lot more than I do but if it sounds wrong to me I will definitely seek a second or third opinion. I will do research online also just to see if others have the same issues.
1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician since I have been a long time patient of hers and she has kept me healthy all that time even though I have several problems that could make me unhealthy if not treated right.
0.600000	doctors don't take time to know their patients i don't believe that have enough information about me to give me best advice or medicine
0.600000	I used to not trust my other Doctor, but them I got rid of him and now I have a new doctor. I trust my new doctor a lot more than my old one. I don't put my trust in anyone too much, but I trust this new doctor a little bit more.
0.600000	Doctors tend to just want to prescribe drugs whether or not you actually need them. It's how they're taught to do their job. 
0.880000	Our PC is extraordinarily thorough. If I cad to criticize anything, it would be that all of his concerns share the same high priority.
1.000000	My doctor is the bomb he listens to my and my needs. I trust him with my care. He is firm but kind and ice been seeing him for seven years.
0.640000	They know me better than I know myself and have always given me good advice and care. If I didn't trust them then I would probably switch to a different doctor. Trust is definitely important

0.960000	I have been with this doctor for almost my whole life and they also treat other friends i know and i just trust them alot
0.720000	Most doctors are trustworthy, their time is so valuable that they tend to cut to the chase and give only a few minutes and rarely find out how you really are doing.
0.680000	Sometimes doctors are preoccupied with administrative priorities rather than health care. It appears that the government has changed the meaning of health care
0.880000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. I trust him implicitly to attend to my health and well being.
0.560000	I don't trust my primary care doctor mostly because I feel like I'm being rushed through my appointments. Also because they tend to diagnose you with something and give you medication even when they are not completely sure if what is really wrong with you.
0.760000	My doctor is very blunt and tells it how it is. He tells me all the options and then tells me what he recommends.
0.600000	I do in some ways trust my doctor or sometimes if they have a lot of patients then I am not as trusting
0.680000	I am currently between doctors, but in general, I haven't experienced any issues where a doctor seemed to dismiss my concerns or rush me.
0.600000	 When they make a diagnosis without hearing symptoms from me, and I feel rushed out with minimal dialogue. 
0.600000	"I trust most doctors in general as long as they can explain why they recommend the things they do. I need more than a ""you need to do this"" explanation."
0.600000	I think I can trust my doctors to do the right think.  There are too many checks and balances. My doctor works as part of a team of care providers.
0.760000	I trust my doctor, because she is the only one I have seen to diagnose me correctly and treat me accordingly. She has improved my day-to-day life, while the others have only done what they find convenient. 
0.800000	She considers information provided and what she sees. She is a known, competent authority and a worthwhile resource. That reputation has been earned over the years.
0.760000	I trust him because he always takes the time to do the correct test. He listens to my concerns and questions then explains everything calmly to me. 
0.840000	If you ask a question and they don't give you a answer and just walk away makes me distrust the doctor and if they give you a answer makes me trust them.
0.560000	i have used the same physician for 20+ years. in the last few years, he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor who i felt was completely incompetent , he has hired a pa that is not  listening to me, is affiliated with a hospital where i spent 3 days in pure hell (incompetence running rampant.), renewed a prescription and then a month later called the pharmacy and cancelled it( it was blood pressure medicine..i can't believe these things are going on in his office without his knowledge..
0.400000	Doctor never listens to concerns and basically acts superior does not explain anything and rarely rechecks if I still have the symptoms
0.800000	The doctor appears to be well informed and caring in regards to the patients that are scene. There are times when they appear to be rushed though.
0.840000	Primary care physicians in general should be trusted by their patients. They are very good at what they do.
0.720000	For the most part, she isn't like most doctors. There have been a few times where we didn't agree on certain treatments, but in the end, we birth found something that was helpful to the both of us 
1.000000	She is blunt, yet caring. Very thorough and answers all questions to make sure I have a good understanding

1.000000	First of all, he is a Kaiser doctor and we have 40 years of not good but great experience there. After 10 years how could we not love him!
0.600000	I have to have a cat scan in a few months for my back, and I had already gotten an X-Ray, my doctor says I should have a Cat scan, but I'm very small. I think a cat scan will be too powerful for my back and very harmful to my body, but my doctor didn't think differently. I hope when doctors make these decisions they think realistically with their patients. 
0.320000	They are always in a hurry to be done and move in to the next patient I am not seenas the individual I am 
0.240000	I distrust my pcp because he once delayed giving me test results for months when they were available and I contacted him over and over for them.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician a lot. She is always kind and helpful and she goes above and beyond to answer my questions and to help me understand everything. 
0.680000	I think there are always other alternative treatments beyond medication. However, the focus of treatment seems to be a prescribed medication rather than treating a condition with natural options.
0.880000	I have ab excellent relationship with my Doctor and feel she has the background and skills necessary to manage my health and health issues.
0.880000	She tells me exactly how she feels and makes sure that I receive all the tests I need to take.  She is available to me 7/24.

0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to listen, solicits input, and carefully explains everything to me.
0.720000	It is hard to trust him when he is rushed and not really answering my questions. I feel that he sees a lot of malingering and assumes that my issues are not as harmful as other people's. I tend to downplay my concerns. I don't want to be a bother to him.
0.600000	I feel they are too busy inputing data in the computer to be able to hear my issues.  My meds were inputted wrong and I am having a devil of a time to solve that issue. I tell that what I need and then it does not get done.  And I have to call and hound them for weeks to get my issues resolved. It is horrible that you can not trust the office staff to do what needs to be done.  I am able to voice my opinion but some people do not understand that they need to disagree and have a voice in their treatment plans.
0.840000	I have been seeing my doctor for over 20 years, and he knows me very well. He is calm and careful and is able to make better recommendations because he knows about my family, my lifestyle, my history, etc. He stays current with medical literature and developments in healthcare.
0.680000	My doctor talks extensively with me about any feelings I may have regarding my health or treatment. I feel I can say anything to him or her (I have two physicians) about what I'm feeling or worried about, therefore, I feel I can trust them in my care & treatment.
0.640000	I believe mu doctor is too set in her own opinions, and reluctant to support my wishes which are based on my experience with previous doctors.
0.720000	I mostly trust my physician, however, I am concerned that he is not thorough enough.  I feel as though I have to request standard tests that should be routine for my age.
1.000000	She is honest and is down to earth. She has my well being has her first priority and she is very thorough
0.680000	i think my doctor is caring and thoughtful of everything he does and he is truthful about what he says 
1.000000	My doctor is a honest person. She would never lie to me.  I trust her completely. I know her. She is a very good doctor.
0.960000	He has gone above and beyond for me. He has made referrals to several places, ordered tests, and tried to get to the bottom of my health issues
0.520000	"Sometimes I feel as if my PCP doesn't take my concerns serious and just brushes them to the side. My doctor sometimes has this ""I'm the professional and your not"" kind of attitude, as if she is trying to make me feel dumb. She is also not very comforting."
0.760000	My doctor is usually very thorough. He listens intently to everything that I try to communicate to him.He shows genuine concerne for my well being.
0.920000	My doctor is a smart man and asks me questions about how I feel and then makes the diagnosis.  If I say that doing spiritual things help then he trusts my instincts. If I tell him that a medicine doesn't work then we change it.
0.600000	my PCP is new to me.  still getting to know him, only seen him 3 times.  my initial reaction is that he is NOT very proactive and that concerns me.
0.560000	i do not trust anyone now days. to many things go wrong and to much sueing going on these days. doctors seem like they just want your money more than your well being
0.800000	I have had good experiences so far, he is thorough and very good at explaining all aspect of the treatments he dispenses and is an excellent listener 
0.600000	I think I can trust my doctor enough to know what is wrong with me but i would get a second opinion if I had something big wrong or thought the answer was not up to par.
0.920000	I have had the same doctor for at least 10 years.  He has always been completely honest with me and spends a lot of time with me. He will get to the bottom of any discomfort I may have and makes me feel well taken care of.
1.000000	My doctor has years of specialized training and is up to date on all the latest medicine and their side effects.  I feel free to tell my doctor that I would prefer another option, if available.
0.720000	I basically trust my doctor because he does have a treatment that works. Sometimes I wish they would listen to their patients a little more.
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor but I also know that sometimes doctors have other interests in mind. Example, if a new drug has come out and insurance will give the doctor a bonus for each patient who prescribes to said medicine for a certain medical condition, the doctor may persuade you try it if it pertains to your treatment even if it's not the best course of action for you 
1.000000	Feel totally free to talk about anything and to ask questions of my doctor.  Think she understands me and she is always willing to go the extra mile for my benefit.
0.600000	i suppose i trust them. i wanted to rule out some stuff, try some more their sophisticated tech there,..... 
0.920000	My doctor wants to know about my activities and life so she can better address my medical problems not just the lab work
0.640000	I worked at a hospital for along while doctors worry more about getting as many patients seen and worry less a out providing good healthcare this has gotten worse. Since Obama care started

0.840000	I feel my doctors have always been honest with me. They have always all options for a treatment and the informaion foe me to make a good decision

0.960000	My present doctor is the best I have ever had.  He is a Polish Jew and is very caring and compassionate.
0.600000	"My primary care physician is ""new"" (at least to me) and a bit young and naÃ¯ve. She knows practically nothing about diabetes, yet tries to micro-manage me and my condition, never understanding why her methods of treatment aren't working well. Thought my Endocrinologist and I had finally gotten my primary care doctor ""out of the picture,"" then she reared her ugly head again. Now I'm again faced with having to satisfy BOTH of them!"
0.840000	she been my doctor for so many years and all the sickness i had she got me through all of them. she alway tell me what is wrong and what i need to take and do to get better
0.840000	I do not thoroughly trust my primary physician I trust my cardiologist the most especially since I had a heart attack last month and a double bypass,I don't feel like my primary physician was doing all he should have prior to my having a heart attack  
0.440000	I really have no reason to distrust my PCP.  So far, she has not proposed anything which I felt to be wrong.  Further, I'll ask questions should I feel uncertain.
0.760000	It's not that I don't trust him I just think he has limited information.  No one can be on top of all of the new treatments but I think he does the best he can.  He is happy to refer me to specialists or others that might have a better grasp of a health issue.  For that reason alone, I have learned to trust his guidance.
1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician she is very thorough and explains everything to me so I understand it
0.880000	I trust my doctor she is always listening and gets to the bottom of it or she keeps trying! The office is also friendly and supportive.
0.760000	My primary care physician studied for years at medical schools and colleges in order to learn their practice and become a medical professional. They took an oath to help people and never cause harm and so this causes me to trust them and believe they have my best intentions at heart. 
0.800000	My Doctor explains everything to me, sometimes I do not grasps everything but if it is put in his notes I can look it up. If I need to see him he will see me but I will have to wait to be squeezed between appointments of other people. 
0.680000	In most instances I do trust my primary care physician but sometimes would rather have another opinion about more complex problems
0.960000	I am typically a type of person who does not like medication being the first option for everything. My doctor understands that and will give me other options that don't include medication.
0.600000	Don't currently have a physician, but have usually trusted them when I have. They've taken the time to answer any questions, and make me feel comfortable
0.520000	always very trustworthy, been going to the same doctor for 10 years now, always very good to me and treats me right, i don't feel like they are doing anything that would make me distrust them
0.840000	i believe that health care is mainly a way of making money. Maybe there are some providers that are honest and caring but the majority are in it for the money
0.640000	I just acquired a new PCP and he seems to be very thourough but by the book with no deviations. He doesn't have any faith in holistic or healthfood supplements
0.800000	I have been going to my internist for over three years now and have trusted her from the very beginning.  She's never given me a reason to think otherwise, but as I am a somewhat skeptical person, I can't honestly give her 5s in these ratings.
0.720000	I trust him to a point - he is so busy seeing a lot of patients at any given time I sometimes wonder if he really understands all my problems/ailments. 
0.640000	My physician is always in a hurry and sometimes doesn't take the time to listen or to explain things to me. I have considered finding another physician for this reason.
1.000000	I trust them to the fullest extent they are very well trained have went to college and always looking out for the best with their patients I would never have a reason to not trust my doctor they are recommended by other people I know and deal with alot people 
0.840000	I trust both of my doctors, MD and psych. They have a great track record with me and my treatments. I don't know what else to say.
0.960000	My primary care physician has been our family's doctore for 25 years. He is a caring man who explains thing in depth to my wife & I.
0.800000	The doctor seems quite professional and knowledgeable. And seems to be genuinely interested in hearing what I have to say.
0.760000	He is a good doctor. He tries to make comfortable.  Good staff, nice offices. I can usually get in and out without crazy long waits.

0.840000	I have worked with for many years and found his advice to be very good and has helped be get over various health issues in a reasonable time by following it.
0.760000	He has been my family doctor for many years. He has seen us through many health crisises. He is very  good at referring us when he feels we need specialists.
0.760000	Your primary care provider will monitor your health closely by taking your medical diagnostic tests, and coordinating your care with any specialists you may need
0.720000	I dont really have a primary doctor at this time. So I generally believe that doctors are trustworthy, to what degree, however, is debatable.
0.840000	I find that my doctor is straight with her/his clients and does their job well at keeping you as healthy as possible
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because they always tell me the right things and steer me in the right  direction, they never tell me anything wrong.
0.760000	they are usually honest up front about what is going on with me. ask if I have any questions on anything. a few times the doctor did not read when I listed I can't do clartin allergy pills or nasal spray
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because they tend to know better than I do what is better for me when it comes to my health
0.720000	I feel like I have a bond with my doctor and i feel as if he has my best interest at heart. I trust his decisions when it comes to my health.
1.000000	I have no reason to distrust him.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with my doctor so far.  He listens to what I say and vice versa. 
0.600000	They are kind and know what they are doing.  She never seems to rush and always has time for my questions
0.600000	All doctors, like all eople, are different. In my lifetime I had to change my doctors due to unprofessional aproach.
0.520000	i trust them but im skeptical bevause they are sometimes rough and rude and they make themselves out to be not trusted
0.600000	I guess I would say I trust him. I feel I dont have any other choice. I dont think my dr would want to misinform me
0.400000	Physicians no longer care about their patients. It's about whatever metric the health system that owns their practice. They typically overbook. They don't care about keeping patients waiting. If you have an additional question that is raised during their cursory assessment, they ask you to make another, separate appointment in order to address those concerns. Nurses are fat and act annoyed that the patients are interrupting their donut break. Another nurse was eating ribs at the desk and barked at me when I had a question. Doctors want to give a quick fix and usually write a prescription instead of looking at the patient holistically and taking the time to do a comprehensive assessment. 
0.600000	I think sometimes doctors just want to make appointments and prescribe medication in order to make money.
0.680000	Based on years of service my doctor is reliable, friendly, patient, caring and will tell me the truth about my medical needs!
0.840000	She is nice and talks about things openly and never talks rudely about anything or anyone. She is always willing to help with medical needs.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she's honest and I feel that she care about me and my family. Ive been going to her for several years
0.720000	Doctors today have a lot on their plate. As a result, they are squeezed into a role which makes them sometimes unapproachable. That means they have to rush through appointments to get as many in as possible. As a result, they are not able to spend the time they need with each patient, assess their needs, and prescribe the right treatment. If a doctor takes the time to assess and communicate with me concerning my medical needs and condition, then I trust him or her. I figure that they know more about medicine than I do, and they are willing to take the time to find out what I really need, medically.
0.760000	after searching, found one who seems to understand what I need/feel about care from a physician, and after lengthy discussions with him, we have reached a level of understanding and mutual respect for each of out decisions.
0.600000	I trusted my doctor til she turned me over to a nurse practioner in her practice.  I am not confident with the abilities of the nurse practioner although I do like her as a person.  She seems very kind and sweet.
0.800000	My doctor is knowledgeable and experienced in treating my condition. He discusses with me what the options are for treating my condition. He answers any questions that I have concerning my condition and my treatment options.
0.960000	I have a tremendous primary care physician who actually takes great pains to make sure I receive excellent medical care. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor to explain completely, to tell me what I need to know.  He does not trust alternative treatments very much.  I check with another health professional (whom I trust) about those options.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to me and asks questions. He looks at my chart and asks me follow up questions regarding ongoing medical issues. My previous physicians were already writing prescriptions before I finished talking to them and did not bother to look at my file before meeting with me.
0.560000	I don't have a primary physician, I see whoever is there. And while they all seem nice, I do not feel like they fully listen to what I tell them. I don't think they are as thorough as should be. 
0.960000	I have been seeing my doctor for over 7 years now and had seen her very frequently in the last year. All the treatments she prescribed worked for me and she listened what I had concerns.
0.840000	He is very reassuring and steered me in better directions than previous doctors.  He's up front and honest about every option.
0.520000	there have been too many occasions when the side effects of doctor's remedies have caused more and worse problems than the original purpose for seeking medical advice
0.360000	They do not discuss the real reasons for my visits.  They do not listen to my symptoms or how it affects my daily like.  I don't think a 15 min appointment is enough time to asses any condition.
0.840000	I trust my primary physician because he listens to what I say, and plays an active part in my health care.
0.680000	I always have full trust and my doctor they have my best interest in mind. So there's no reason I shouldn't trust that
0.800000	They are trained professionals.  Why would I not trust them?  It's their job to tell me good and bad news.
0.560000	I don't think they know me well enough to possibly know what is best for me personally. I trust that they're giving me recommendations or information that they think is generally best, though.
0.760000	I generally trust my PCP. I have been seeing him for many years and his advice is generally good. He does, however, sometimes gives me advice on things outside of his specialty. I take that advice with a grain of salt.
0.520000	You can't be sure who to trust in the medical field, one person is different than the other, but most are all out for the money, not for much else.
0.640000	Does not take time with me. He is in and out of the room and unabale to ask him questions. He is one doctor and does not have a partner. Lack of communcation between the patient.
1.000000	I have a lot in common with my Dr. She knows my limitations and spends the time I need with her to see that I understand what and why she is doing what she does.
0.760000	 i dont have a primary doc I go to a practice that you will see a different doctor every time or a pa nurse practioner  .  at the time I changed doctors I DID NOT LOOK FOR A doctor at the time so I just go to this practice
0.840000	My doctor goes out of her way to get answers for me. When my diagnosis is unsure she does research. I have had a ver positive experience so far. 
1.000000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician, if I didn't I would switch my doctor, I have trust in all the medical providers I use and that includes my opthamalogist,  my gastroenterologist, my orthopedist, my dentist, my urologist and any other health care providers I need and my family needs.
0.600000	ive been seeing my dr since i was 11, 20 years now. she knows me in and out (no pun intended) and i know she has my best interests at heart. she also listens to my opinions and respects when i disagree.
0.840000	my doctor is very good  she is very thorough  and asks me a lot of questions  i like her very much  she always takes a good amount of time with me 
0.240000	My doctor is always looking at a computer and asking my thoughts on in. he has brought up his personal problems and comparing his problems to mine 
0.600000	I am in the process of switching physicians so this is not a question I can answer right now. I had been with my doctor for years, but seem to have lost all faith and trust in him
0.800000	I believe that my Dr knows em over the years and we have developed a relationship which is trustworthy and honest. We share info when needed without any concerns how the info is received. 
0.960000	I was sick 10 years ago and my doctor was awesome! He explained everything and put me in the right hands of another doctor in the hospital
0.800000	For the most part I trust doctors.  The challenging limitation to my answers is that the VA has cycled through many contract physicians who - individually are intellegent and compassionate - are not around long enough to have a consisted convesation/relationship.
1.000000	My doctor is very thorough and intelligent.  He has always communicated directly to me and his decisions about my treatment have been right on target.
0.360000	I have never been to trustworthy when it comes to people of the medical staff just do to many story I hear from my friends and family about what has happened to them.
0.600000	I trust most doctors. No reasons to not trust doctors. I don't know how else to explain it Nothing else to write 
0.440000	I dont trust my doctor because he asked me what medicines i think i should be perscribed.He takes very little time in getting to know what the problem is.He is always in a hurry to be done with the appointment and does not explain things very well
0.800000	I think that most primary care physicians have the knowledge to do what is best for their patients.  They care about their patients well being and take this very seriously.
0.720000	My doctor seems to take a conservative approach towards treatment. He is not too quick to recommend medication and advises a healthy overall lifestyle. 
0.920000	we have a young, enthusiastic doctor who comes from a family of doctors; he listens to me. Since I do a lot of research on medical issues, I feel he is giving me correct information.
0.440000	I would have to say the reason is they do not call you if blood work or urine comes back as bad unless you go back in a week or so later.  Why can they not just call and give one results over the phone especially when you live far away from a doctors office to begin with.
0.560000	I feel that she is capable and up-to-date but sometimes doesn't listen to details that might make a difference in my care
0.520000	I just feel like they're more worried about how what they can do might impact their career than really paying attention to what's going on
1.000000	Personable and sharing, shows interest in and concern for all of his patients. That he listens to my questions and opinions is obvious to me from his answers and reactions.
0.640000	WELL THERE MY PRIMARY CAR DOC SO THEY SHOULD KNOW WHATS BEST FOR ME. THEY BEEN A PRIMARY DOC FOR YEARS AN KNOW BETTER THAN I DO
0.920000	he takes the time and effort to explain all health issues. He never seems to be in a big hurry to move onto the next patient
0.640000	I have a primary care physician. He is trained well and a well learned. He serves me on a good faith. I am satisfied upon him.
0.400000	Doctors are not trained to find out what is really going on with a patient instead they are paid off by big Pharma to prescribe
0.680000	I trust my physician a whole lot. I trust that he/she will give me the perfect advice all or most of time at least and wouldn't stir me the wrong way.
0.600000	I've had quite a few bad experiences with doctors, so I don't have much confidence in them. Plus lack of health insurance prevents me from having a primary care physician
0.760000	I generally trust my physician because of past experience. I also tend to recognize the reason for their assessments.
0.720000	He has always been straight forward.  When something serious has arisen, he has no problem forwarding me on to a specialist for care.  He is quick to respond when I need an appointment.  Sometimes, he is a bit distracted, but then again aren't we all.  Now, you say in the medical world that is not to be, but when he has been this way, it has not been regarding anything really serious and just seemed in a hurry.
0.480000	Due to issues with my health insurance and past experiences by parents have had. My mother has a rare from of kidney disease, and it took 12 years, 8 doctors, 20 procedures, and 5 surgeries to finally correct the problem and my health insurance didn't want to do their job and pay the doctors due to how many doctors my mom had to visit and had to get help from.
1.000000	I have had my PP for a few decades now and he is always on top of any of my concerns. He knows me and has all of my medical background info. 
0.760000	She listens to me and she is always available to answer question or to find the answers for me that she may not know.  
0.520000	this doctor is new to me, he seems like he is in a hurry all the time. so, its too soon to tell at this point.
0.960000	My PCP has given me care for over 25 yrs so I literally trust her with my life ang9the life of my child.
0.760000	She is a good doc but doesnt always like to do what i feel is right treatment for me. Example. I would like the shot for shingles but she says i am not old enough. I also want the pheunemenacocal shot she wont give it. I am almost 51 and want prtected before i get sick
0.600000	I trust my care physician they know what's best in my eyes I trust them they know what best when it comes to Heath 
1.000000	MY PHYSICIAN KNOWS ME BY NAME.  HE IS AN INTEGRATED PHYSICIAN AND LOOKS AT NUTRITION AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL MEDICINE.  HE LOOKS AT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM NOT JUST A REGULATING MEDICATION. 
0.680000	He listens to me and if there are issues that he has concerns about that require a specialist he never hesitates to send me to one. However, as I believe with most primary care docs he is somewhat rushed.
0.640000	I have a hard in easy life in I try to do the right thing all the time but life can have a way of bring you down in doubt yourself in put you in a negative mood but I try to over come it 
0.840000	My primary care person listens to what I have to say and we work to find the best solution to any problem I might have.

0.760000	"I have a long standing relationship with my primary care doctor.   He ""gets"" me and knows how much to push if extra treatment is involved."
0.840000	my primary care physician seems like a believable type of person that could provide me with the accurate info that I need to know about my health
0.600000	I have never had a problem with a doctor.  This survey is not for me because I don't have any of these problems.

0.960000	I thinks he cares about his patients and he knows what's he doing. He has helped me many times and I trust him
0.680000	I distrust my doctor sometimes because I think she is more concerned with saving the VA hospital money by delaying my treatment . I trust her because at times she goes to bat for me sometimes .
0.640000	I have military healthcare through my husband. Both my primary care doctor and my neurologist were recently rotated out to new duty stations. Both of them were really good, and saw me through my initial GBS-CIDP diagnosis and the first cycle of recovery and recurrence. I'm now on cycle #2 and both my current doctors are new to this duty station. They may prove to be just as good as my last doctors...but I just haven't seen them often enough to make that determination yet.

0.840000	"For my primary care physician I reserve time to meet with the doctor to discuss my health care plan to see if we can have a honest and open relationship in managing my health. I would not continue to see a physician that did not have time to discuss my health, ensure all my questions and concerns are addressed, and ever said to me ""you wouldn't understand or just do as I say"". Health care is a team effort between the patient, family members, and care Providers."

0.640000	My primary care physician has practiced medicine in my hometown for about thirty-five years and is well respected. More over, he has been treating members of my family for most of that time. I trust him fairly implicitly.

0.680000	I trust my doctor for the most part, however I don't think doctors know everything and they should really listen to their patients views and opinions when it comes to their health and what their body is telling them.

0.800000	Although I do generally trust my doctor there are times when I feel I am seen as a patient and other times when I feel I am seen like one more hurdle the doctor has to get through before his work day is done. Sometimes it seems it is a quick examination and a treatment and throw me out the door. 
0.880000	he has a lot of years experience and has had his own practice for many years,and gives full explanations of medical conditions
0.680000	There is never enough time and he is always running late. I wish he would be on time and listen to my issues.

0.280000	medical offices are constrained by regulations and requirements to post insurance companies, medicare 
0.760000	 trust my doctor because he is very knowledgable about most if not all medical information that is relevent to my medical and emotional wellbeing. if i have any questions, he explains what i need to know to make an informed decision.
0.640000	I trust my caregivers because they would not decieve me. They are supposed to do no harm and care about their patients
1.000000	I trust my primary care Doctor to take the best care of me. Primary Care Doctors take as an oath to provide the best care. Primary Care Doctors want a good reputation. Primary Care Doctors have great mal practice insurance.
0.560000	Because they get paid when you fill out a prescription they wrote.  The more prescriptions they write and you fill, the more they make.
0.680000	I believe we are all humans and humans make mistakes. So, although I trust my doctor they are not perfect.

0.600000	I don't go to the doctor often and have no medical condition. I don't have a doctor I see regularly for anything so I don't really have anything to base an answer off of.
0.600000	I do not have a primary physician, however I rely on my sister, who is a physician, for all things medical. I don't always follow her advice, but I do listen and ask the appropriate questions before making my own decisions. However, I know many, many doctors and don't trust a great deal of them to have the patient's best interest at heart. Sometimes they are lazy. Sometimes they are condescending. Sometimes the amount of money they'll receive from the patient's insurance/pockets matters the most.
0.520000	Sometimes I feel like my primary care physician only wants to hurry up and move onto the next patient.
0.800000	"I do believe in being informed, myself, but at the end of the day, for some things, one has to trust an ""expert"" - I feel that picking a doctor is hard. But once you have picked a doctor you feel you can trust, then you should trust them."
0.600000	He seems like  a  good  person  hope  I can  keep  this one longer then a year  I hope  all goes  well  with  this  doctor  
0.440000	because they just  care about how much money they can get from I have had to make the decision for like chorlesterol meds
1.000000	If I didn't have trust in my physician I'd find one I do trust.  This is somewhat of an absurd question.  My physician ALWAYS explains things, is upfront, takes necessary time and explains everything 
0.520000	i know how doctors get kick backs for prescribing certain medications and although I do like my doctor, I still don't trust that they always have my best interests in mind. 
0.600000	I trust most doctors but I have had a few that seemed like I was just another number and just tell you something to get you in and out quickly

0.680000	I have not seen my PCP very often as I switched about 1 1/2 years ago and mainly have the need to see specialists.  When I have seen my PCP I feel he cared and did what he felt best and was honest with me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. I have never had a problem. They have always been nice and made me feel comfortable. 
0.600000	I trust the knowledge that doctors have to identify a problem and provide solutions, but I distrust the use/prescription of medications when they aren't necessary to solve the issue.
0.960000	My doctor is very conscientious.  He asks me a lot of questions to get to why I feel the way I do.  He is very empathetic.  
0.920000	He takes the time to listen to me.  I am comfortable talking to him and he answers any questions in a senseable way. He also suggests more economical a alternative options instead of just drugs. 
0.600000	I am neutral on how I feel about trusting my Doctor. I will listen and use my common sense or go with my gut feeling and/or research more on my own.
0.920000	my doctor is up on everything as he goes to conference. He also knows pharmacolical answersMy daughter who is the hospital CFO recommended him.

0.880000	I have went to the same doctor for a number of years and he has always listens to the questions I have. For example, if I need additional blood work or tests, he explains why this is necessary and what he is looking for. I trust his judgment and am appreciative of his care and concern.
0.560000	had personally bad experiences with doctors in regards to making/performing good decisions, seems to be more out to make money than helping patients
0.760000	I believe doctors are generally there to help you, not hurt or deceive you. They are looking to make you feel better as that is my most people go into the medical field.
0.600000	well fost off I just want to say that in no way shape or form I have a primary care physician and I also have little experience with doctors
1.000000	My doctor is extremely familiar with my worries, feelings of helplessness at times and he provides enough time to listen to my concerns. He is very empathetic. 
1.000000	This is the person I rely on for the truth more so than anyone else besides my family. These are the people that try to keep us alive.
0.840000	we have built a relationship, he knows what we desire and expect and all live up to the exceptions we have set
0.960000	I trust my doctor because I've been with him for years, and through those years, I've become healthier and happier by following his advice. I was overweight and unhealthy just a couple years back, and because of a healthy routine prescribed by my doctor, I've shed pounds and am much healthier today.
1.000000	She has been my doctor for years. She is older and has been a doctor for years. I basically like how she conducts an examination. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician's knowledge, in that has been able to direct me in the right path of medical care for several years. She has directed me to specialists whom I have found to be great doctors. She is very knowledgeable--a specialist, in fact--in the area of breast cancer, which is of special concern to me because of my family history. She takes plenty of time to ask and answer questions at each visit.
0.920000	It comes from experience. he is very honest and explains everything. I don't know what else you want to know
0.560000	I do not have complete trust  or distrust for doctors but I feel most are more about making a buck than they are about caring for their patients.
0.520000	too busy and they can't be bothered to sit actually listen to what you have to say. your just a number to them
0.640000	I trust my primary care doctor. I have been with the same person for 4years and she is very knowledgeable and always on point with treatment and what to do
0.480000	It seems that physicians want to treat symptoms rather than dig to find causes and solve complex medical issues now.The latter takes more time and effort and expense and the medical industry does not favor the old diagnostic approach to medicine.Physicians are too ready to write prescriptions than to treat patients with drugs.
0.760000	I believe my physician mostly cares about his patients, including me. Any problems I have with him stem from his reliance on a completely helpless and unintelligent staff.
0.560000	I have general trust as he has been working for many years and has usually fixed my ailments. However, I do feel that he is getting lazier as he nears retirement and sometimes wonder if he suggests medications due to relationships he has with pharmaceutical companies.
0.640000	sometimes I think they take things out of control because everyone body is different and sometimes the things they said we should be taking it ends up making us worst or bad 
0.840000	I have had the same physician for several years. He is patient with my many questions. He is easily accessible. 
0.800000	I don't know, I just trust her. Maybe because she is friendly or maybe it was the time she didn't know something and consulted her colleague while I was there. I just feel that I can trust her.
0.480000	Being given conflicting information then the denial, can never simply admit being human and making a mistake
1.000000	She is very good at what she dose and she know what she dose and tell u what is wrong and is very understanding and talk to u
0.640000	Sometimes physicians give unnecessary treatment and sometimes they are on point with treatment with my personal experience I always recommend a second opinion 
0.480000	My primary care doctor works for the Dept Of Veterans Affairs, I truly believe he has the best interest of the VA not me.
0.720000	I have been going to my primary care dotor now for 17 years.  I feel that he has my best interest at heart.
1.000000	goes in depth with our discussions, goes the extra step when preliminary tests are not within the appropriate range, explains actions and my consent before adjusting meds or recommending actions
0.800000	I trust him because he has been one of my doctor's for 15 years and knows my medical history. He bases decisions on my history.
0.760000	I trust my Dr because she is very honest with me. She tells me what she thinks is the best situation for me regarding my diabetes. We also talk about family. I know she is married to another Dr, and they have 2 boys. I broke my fibula last year, and she was very honest with me regarding the healing process with my leg. I took about 10 months to heal, and I sometimes still have pain. She told me I will probably have pain on and off for the rest of my life. diabetes and my age are factors in the slow healing.
0.680000	I trust him enough to provide me with the information I need to make a decision - as to agreeing with what he thinks is best for me, I am neutral.  I make my own decision after speaking with those that are close to me.
0.800000	Well let's see. So far my Doctor hasn't led me astray yet. He has told me to lose some weight, but I think he knows that isn't going to happen anytime soon. When we have a problem, he is willing to work on it to figure out what is going on.
0.880000	Doctors take pride in their skills. I trust them to want to be right. Being dishonest would be a conflict but we all have convenience concerns. 
0.800000	i have been with my primary care doctor for over 5 years. i trust her and i feel that i have a good means of communication wuith her plus she always takes the time to sit with me and explain any issues i may have
0.600000	I really have no reason not to trust my physican or my doctor in general. They are all comptent medical professionals
0.680000	I believe that my primary care physician has my best health thoughts in mind and would not lead me in a direction that would be bad for me
0.600000	She used to be an excellent doctor. Not so much as her practice has expanded. Now she seems to take longer and longer extended vacations.
0.520000	I will never trust a physician because they are just doing their job as an employee and dont genuinely care about you personally. They do what they are trained is best for their career, not for you.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician, but sometimes I don't feel like we could do be everything that we should be doing to make me feel better.
0.560000	Sometimes, doctors are pressured into prescribing their patients with medication they really don't need. So, some doctors are honest and are straight-forward with their patients and some aren't. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because she is very kind and compassionate and always discusses all treatment options to understand what is best for me.
0.520000	"I am not willing to allow a physician to ""put me on"" a batch of drugs that have  adverse side affects so I am not the type of patient most doctors want.  I will listen to their reasons for the recommendations and then weigh what I may know about a drug and whether my symptoms are bad enough to take the risk of the side effects.  "
0.760000	I trust the doctors I have seen because they have spent time listening to me and fully answering my questions.
0.400000	I feel as though doctors sometimes see too many people to really be able to focus on one person care. Also they can't know everything about each individual.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because ethey know me and my health history not to mention they also know my families health istory
0.680000	I trust doctors in general because I believe in the Hippocratic oath and I haven't had a negative experience that would make me distrust them. There are cases (specifically scheduled c-sections) that I think are about convenience, but for the most part, doctors are trustworthy. 
0.800000	I have a god relationship with all of my doctors.  They always take as much time with me as necessary
0.720000	They are sometimes in a hurry. They don't always have all the answers. I value  second opinions or even thirds.
0.960000	I fully trust my physician, I've been going to him for years! He is thorough during my visits, he tries treating disorders/illnesses/conditions without medication first, then if that doesn't work he will prescribe medication. He is totally honest and informative!
0.720000	I feel my doctor completes the bare minimum required of her because I have state insurance so I pat nothing out of pocket for her time, which is as short as she will make it.
0.560000	Very young dr. I am new to practice. She has me on expensive mess that I cannot afford. This causes me stress and anxiety 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because he has never done me wrong. My old doctor was and old arrogant man that was not sympathetic to my problems and concerns so I know a good doctor when I get one.
0.600000	My doctor is getting old a d is probably ready to retire.  Its time to find a new dr but im not one for change
0.760000	He has never given me any bad advice. He has helped me through several situations. I do trust him and do as he recommends.
0.640000	Doctors are just people. Some good, some not so good. I believe todays doctors are overworked and do not have enough time to spend quality time with individual patients.
1.000000	 I trust my primary doctor. He has been my doctor for over 20 years. Even when I was away for several years he remembered me and what condition I was suffering from 15 years ago.
0.760000	I am somewhat distrustful because of a misdiagnose of one of my children in childhood. It delayed his recovery and caused hospitalization that was not necessary.  I believe you have to be your own advocate.
0.760000	It all depends on (1) the doctor (2) the city (3) the facility (4) my personal experience. Some doctors (like the one I have now) I trust 100%. Others in the past? Skeptical.
1.000000	Doctor takes the time to explore any and all problems. Gives the benefit of his knowledge. Never hurries an exam.
0.960000	She maybe be running behind but she never acts like she  is rushing through my appointments.Take the time to answer questions and explain the best treatment for me.  
0.520000	He is always to quick to put me on a pill. Does not want to listen to what my contribute to what is going on. Rushes me out the door.
0.800000	Have a new doctor, she seems to understand my medical conditions and prescribes prescriptions for them. I do/have to trust her for prescribing new prescriptions, or taking some of them away when no longer useful.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel that certain doctors are only in it to make the bucks not to look at the person's health as a whole. 
0.800000	based upon past experiences, I believe he is thorough and has my needs at heart.  If I have questions, he answers without hesitation.  We discuss the issues.  I never feel rushed.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician - I see numerous different doctors in a charity clinic setting.  Some of these doctors I trust as they have a good bedside manner and are clear in their instructions and information.  Others are lacking in bedside manner and seem cold and impersonal, with little care about explanations or answering questions or concerns.
0.200000	It seems like doctors only want to pass out pills. That is a bandage and dose not resolve your problem and has side effects
0.640000	medications are mostly prescribed based off what pharmaceutical reps are pushing, right? So whatever medication I get may not be what the doctor would have preferred to give. 
0.720000	My Doctor has a degree and knows what he is doing , When he is doing surgery on me he is in control I am a sleep and give him all my trust. When he orders medication I trust him to do whats right
0.720000	I think they have your best interests in mind. I do not expect them to do any harm. Also they are well educated and worked hard to get to where they are 
0.840000	I trust my physician because he or she knows the best in health and will tell their opinion based on knowledge.
1.000000	I've been to many doctors but my current Doctor is very nice and explains everything in a Manor I can understand and is always on time and doesn't keep me waiting
0.600000	been with him for a long time and feel confident he is trying to do what's right and look out for my best interest as a doctor.
0.760000	I think doctors usually try to give the best care possible, although sometimes there may be other options available.
1.000000	the advise given to me so far has proven to be right on target as to fixing a few minor problems , results have been very good, feeling much better
0.200000	THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAS LITTLE OR NO TRAINING IN NUTRITION AND RELIES ON PHARMACEUTICAL POISON TO FIX AN ISSUE.

0.560000	I recognize that doctors have bad days or hold onto rigid views.  At the same time, I admire their minds and dedication. I trust my own views more than a doctor's about some things, e.g., nutrition.  But when it comes to serious illness, I would listen to their recommendations and take them under advisement.
0.440000	in this day and age many physicians are more beholden to outside interests such as insurance and drug companies than they are to their patients.
0.760000	My doctor has proven a lot of times that he tries to treat me the best possible way available and I tend to trust him because of it.

0.560000	my primary care physician will tell me I need to take a drug instead of offering something natural to help me. I really try to avoid drugs. I don't completly trust that taking drugs is always the best answer
0.760000	I go to a DO rather than an MD. I think she looks at my health more holistically than a regular MD who looks for what they can prescribe to fix the problem. She asks about other things that may be impacting the issue rather than just writing an Rx.
1.000000	I tust my physician.He always takes plenty of time to examine me and talk to me about all my conditions. He also always ask how my medicines are working.Explains any new medications that may be available to try.

0.640000	"I have little trust in anyone. When I ""trust"" it is because I believe it is possible for there to be a better nature of a situation and person, but I believe for the most part people are liars, or truth benders, or they just don't say everything they should, even if they don't lie. It is complicated. All I know is that I do not fully trust anyone, well... I kinda... it is complicated. Anytime I fully opened up to someone and let my guard down they crushed me. So, I keep my guard up always, and trust so litle I barely trust myself, but I try to trust medical professionals as much as I can, I am getting better at it."
0.600000	"I know multiple cases of healthcare providers that pressure doctors to perform ""low risk"" treatments that have ultimately harmed their patient in the long run until     their insurance ran out. This is an issue with insurance companies, however the medical profession seems to be tied with them on some level."
0.680000	Its been quite a while since I seen my Dr. We moved and I havent found a personal dr. If we are in need of medical care we go to  instacare, I have found them to be knowledgeable and helpful, as if our family dr. Really good to explain.  I trust them both.
0.600000	My primary care physician is part of a large group. I feel my appointments are sometimes rushed, that I get certain tests because of age or other reasons, not because it's warranted. It feels like a 'doctor shop' without personalized attention. The specialist I see often cites outdated information, and doesn't seem to listen to my issues
0.640000	I feel that she is too busy , pressured to not spend enough time. She frequently refers me to a specialist so that my medical information is scattered
0.720000	My doctor gives you options and lets you pick what is best for you. So if he said this is the only option I would most likely believe him. Plus he would probably refer me to a specialist. So I would have a second opinion with the specialist.
0.880000	Doctor is open, honest and explains all situations and answers my questions and concerns. Provides for all necessary tests and labs
0.720000	They have been my primary care doctor for years.  My doctor is careing and usually takes time to listen to me.  She has been able to help me with most problems and trusts me as a patient.  She also has been a doctor to most of my family for years and knows my history.

0.840000	My dr sits down and goes into detail answering my question and explaining any new medication she is giving me.
0.960000	Because me and my doctor are able to go over every ingient so I will have a better understanding what each one does

She is a terrible doctor."

0.800000	I trust my physician because he is a Christian. He is always up beat and nice to me. He knows my health condition and treats me accordingly. 
0.560000	His office is extremely busy, seeing patients every 15 min. or so.  So times I don't feel we've solved a particular issue I'm having.  They are also very lax at getting  paperwork done in a timely manner sometimes...I feel like I need to stay on top of things there.
0.480000	I really don't put a lot of trust in doctors as there are many who will prescribe medications that may not be necessary in order to get the bonuses drug companies offer to promote their drugs.  I prefer doctors that will consider alternative or natural medication
0.720000	I don't distrust my primary physician, he just doesn't completely understand how to handle my current condition. He tends to defer to my other doctors, who I don't trust much at all. 
0.600000	I do not have total trust in my doctors because in my lifetime I have been misdiagnosed.  I question my doctors and will let them know if I disagree with them.

0.520000	i usually don't trust doctors in the hospitals close to me, since i don't have a personal physician. for some reason most doctors that i have interacted with in nyc always seem so distant and not caring of whats going on in your life, especially when it comes to your physical health
0.920000	She has always treated with respect. Explained her answers to questions I had about my health in terms I could understand

0.520000	I trust my doctor to make the right decisions based on their training and knowledge but doctors are human and still make mistakes
0.840000	He listens to me, takes time to listen to my concerns and I feel like he tries to do the best he possibly can for my health problems.
0.960000	I just changed to a new doctor and she is very caring. She was very patient when I saw her for the first time. She took time to listen to my concerns and started an immediate plan of action. So far, her plan of action is working and I'm starting to feel better.
0.320000	I think he's just motivated by the dollar. Doesn't care if I die, just wants to prescribe me items that he gets a kickback on.

0.560000	I have only had my PCP for  a short time so we are still in the trust building stage - more to be determined after further diagnosis and treatments.
0.640000	I hardly ever see a doctor because my health  clinic has mostly nurse practitioners.  I do trust their judgement but they don't have the experience and training that doctor's have.  When I ask to see a specialist it very seldom happens unless I keep asking.  In conclusion I trust my nurse practitioner in general but would like to see a doctor sometimes.
0.400000	It is not that I mistrust my doctor but I do need let him make all my decisions for me.   If they prescribe me a medication I research it thoroughly before I decide to take it or not.    I am more in favor of hollistic medicine so I always look for a natural way to help my problem.   Medical doctors only want to give you more pills and I am afraid of the side effects so sometimes I do not take them and seek   a natural way of treating my problem

1.000000	"Since my first visit, post-diagnosis, my Oncologist has taken the time to thoroughly explain all treatment options, along with the associated benefits and side effects.  He advises which treatment course he recommends and then discusses any questions for concerns I may have.  I am now 8 months past what I like to call my ""expiration date"" of 7 - 14 months life expectancy, on my second treatment option and controlling side effects efficiently with minimal use of additional pharmaceuticals, as my wish s to control my cancer with as few chemicals as absolutely necessary and my Oncologist completely supports that as my choice."

0.800000	I like and trust my primary physician. He takes his time with me and answers all my questions. I believe he's well-informed.
0.960000	I love my primary physician.  I do not go that often to the doctor but when i go with my husband he sits down with both of us and explains what is going on and then he explains how he is going to be treating the problem.  I do not think I could ever ask for a better doctor.
0.880000	Because one Doctor put me on medicine that would kill me, didn't believe my medical records.  And couldn't be bothered to ask.  Reduced my faith in everyone in the medical profession

0.640000	I believe that doctors try to give the best advice but they are also human and thus are prone or at least able to make mistakes.
1.000000	my docter is very good at what she does. she knows exactly how to treat me. and what I need to do to stay healthy.
0.880000	I trust my physician because I know that they will do what I ask. They are very trustworthy and I know they will do everything they can to help me
0.880000	She is knowledgeable, thorough, and rated a top doctor in our area.  Therefore I trust her to recommend proper treatments, medications, and procedures that I may need.  She is also good at answering  my questions and keeping he records of my past visits.;;
0.760000	My regular doctor knows what i need and has never been wrong. The hospital doctors on the other hand just send me away with what ever they feel like saying that day and send you home with out treating you.
0.800000	My doctors and dentist are honest and trustworthy.  I have been going to them for a long time and find them to be interested in my health and they have always been receptive to answering my questions and concerns.
0.640000	I'm unsure how I feel about my physician because I rarely see her. I trust her to give me good advice because that is her job.
0.480000	"I have had the same primary care physician for over ten years now, and he has slowly been losing my trust over the years. I have seen him often over the years and have grown tired of him telling me he can make me feel better or that I will be back to my ""old self"" soon. It never happens. I don't trust that he knows how to help me. "
0.720000	I've been going to the same health care provider for many years. I am very satisfied with my health care. I will most likely be there for the duration
0.600000	the doctor i last saw is no longer working in the doctor's office I go to so I don't know how I would answer this question.
0.800000	So far things my doctor recommends have worked. I don't always take everything prescribed though.  She always answers all my questions 
0.600000	at times I feel I am not being heard and the appointments are rushed and then other times I feel like I am being referred to other doctors to have tests possibly done, when my prmary care doctor could just order the test
1.000000	I have been with  my primacy care physician for 14 years.  He has been with me every step of the way during my cancer surgery and treatments and has shown a great depth of interest in my well being.  He was very understanding and compassionate during that time and extremely helpful as always.
0.520000	Unfortunately, I live in a town where the doctors don't care about anything but money. I have been misdiagnosed (about having a heart attack)  that could have killed me. I have a hard time trusting doctors after that.
1.000000	In today's world and insurance drs have to turn alotbof patients Not only have I never been rushed through an appt but the dr never forgets to ask about my family When called I always receive a call back the same day
0.200000	I have been misdiaganosied a few times. I had a stroke and was told go home and rest it was a pinched nerve. My doctor does not listen well and does not trust I know my own body. I have been told many times I dont have something like kidney stones and after tests confirmed that i do.
0.720000	I do not generally trust or distrust people, doctors included.  It depends on the individual doctor, the condition/issue, the degree to which that professional is (or is not) already behind schedule, on overload, in a hurry, worried, etc.  They are human, after all.  My doctor is quite thorough; in part I suspect it is her way of assuring she stays on track and covers everything though it sometimes seems to be at a cost to whatever my particular agenda might be during a given visit.  We have worked it out that she does her routine questions and I bring a list of my issues, so both of us has time.  This seems to be effective, though it would be wasted in a rotating medico situation where one did not see the same physician regularly.
0.640000	I generally trust my primary care physician yet I realize that any final decisions about my health (including treatments, medicines, etc.) are my choice to make.  Doctors are there to help the patients, give them advice, and so forth.  It is up to the patient to also rely on him or herself for health care.
0.680000	I trust my doctor to help me make decisions in regards to my emotional health and physical health. I am comfortable asking questions about things.
1.000000	I think that doctors in general have your best interests in common and that you should trust them generally speaking to help you whenever you need it.  You should follow any and all instructions that they give you under most circumstances unless you feel you might need a second opinion from another doctor.
0.600000	I don't have a primary doctor so these don't really apply to me personally. I think a primary care doctor is more reliable than an error doctor because they're less rushed and spend more one on one time with patients
1.000000	My pPCPis a good person and I trust her.  She is interested in me personally, I can tell, and takes her time when I am with her.  My gut feeling is always good about her.  I'm glad I found her as my PCP.
0.800000	I trust my physician. He encourages questions and respects my preference for natural alternatives to prescribed services.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he gets very personal and not just all about the work. He actually makes time to have regular conversations to make you comfortable 
0.760000	Doctors have expertise in field of medicine, have completed training, and continue to train when new science is applicable, where I on the other hand do not have any experience in the medical field. 
0.480000	My dr only cares about getting out of your room and on to the next person. I am looking for a new dr. At the moment.
0.920000	They have the knowledge and understand the best course of treatment for whatever is medically wrong with me.
0.960000	I have know my primary care physician for a long time and have the utmost trust in him in treating all my health issues. 
0.640000	Because they are all about getting as much money as possible. And getting as many patients in and out quick as possible.
0.920000	I have always felt my doctor has been totally open and honest with me.  I have never felt rushed.  I feel like I can tell her anything and will get an truthful answer back.
0.600000	I don't know him very well yet, but I think he will be a good fit to handle my complex medical needs.
0.840000	they dont listen to what you try to tell them, when you try to tell them how you feel and what meds you need they dont wanna try to make you feel better
0.720000	I trust them and they usuallt have my best interest at heart... i love doctors and believe they gerenally are good and have my best interest at heart
0.400000	My PCP only takes 5 minutes with me, asks me a couple of questions, fills out a prescription slip and quickly leaves the room. I do not feel she is acting in my best interests, and she does not listen to me. I react very badly to most manufactured pharmaceuticals, my doctor knows this and keeps trying to insist I try newer meds. Every single time I switch doctors they want to try this. I flatly refuse as I know how ill they will make me. My attitude is... if it's not broken, don't fix it!  I have met very few doctors that actually take the time to listen and really HEAR what I am saying. All I want is a diagnosis and I will treat myself with natural remedies, if possible.  
0.760000	My rheumatologist is the doctor that I trust the most. He is very knowledgeable and it is obvious that he cares about his patients. He actually save my mother's life at one point because he recognized that she had a rare condition that the other doctors had not seen before. He is very honest about treatments, side effects and possible outcomes and works very hard to find the right treatment for the individual patient.
0.840000	I trust him because he has the knowledge and I have told him everything about me. I don't think he would give me the wrong information about any treatment he would suggest.
1.000000	I have total trust in my primary care physician because he did extensive test during my first visit and was able to make diagnosis that other Doctors had not been able to make. They did not do any of the test that the Doctor I have now performed. That is why I have full confidence in the Doctor that I have now. 
0.200000	kickbacks, bribes, drug deals, side effects, over booking, arrogant about their importance, believe their own lies hate it when others done.  do not care for clients health because when they are healthy doctors and hospitals, insurance companies and drug companies do not make money from them
0.240000	They don't know anything about real health.  They mostly just make decisions based on money and convenience.
0.600000	they are only after money not my health care needs with out money they wouldn't give me the time of day.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because we have been in a dr patient relationship for some time and have gotten to know each other pretty well she listens to me and we don't always agree but come to a workable solution 
0.840000	has always been to the point and forth rite in dealing with me in all of my health concerns even now that I have a rare terminal condition
0.720000	At times I feel I can trust doctors but there have been times that I have been uncertain with a few doctors.
0.440000	There have been times where I left the doctor's office without a diagnosis, without any assistance in dealing with my medical issue.  When I went for a lower back pain, I left with instruction to drink lots of water, but no indication to go for physical therapy, which is what I needed.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they discuss every aspect of my health with me. They also answer any questions I may have. 
0.600000	I might trust them if they seem professional enough. But might not if they wind up  telling me or doing something to me that might not help me.
0.760000	All the times I have visited a doctor or had an exam or even surgery I was always treated with respect, I asked many questions, sometimes the same questions multiple times and I always got the same answer and was not steered wrong. Rarely have I had a disagreement with a doctor .
0.800000	I taught in medical schools and know about their selection and training.  It is a time-tested process.  The quality of practicing physicians is assured by this process.
0.600000	been dealing with my doctor for along time trust what she says                                                        
0.560000	I always have to call and remind my Dr. of things we already discussed.  In someways they are good, but still needs some work.  I don't like it when they screw up the Rx's or don't place the orders.
0.520000	He doesn't really listen to my concerns or questions, only wants to blow it off like it is nothing. i have to repeat my self a lot
0.920000	I have never had a problem with anything my doctor has recommended or prescribed for me for any conditions.
0.840000	ive had past xperiences with my physician like a family doctor.and my doctor tells me everything that i need to know about my condition.
0.840000	He has always given me good advice and I trust him to help me make medical decisions.  Everything he has told me has worked out for the best.
0.960000	I have been going to the same Doctor for 20+ years I have total trust in him he has always helped me whenever needed
0.640000	They are often too busy to give patients the time needed to thoroughly discuss patient options or concerns.
1.000000	I trust my dry. Because I have had to have treatments of plasma 3 times a week for 4 weeks and 4 treatments of MeMO have been made better by listening to him and the treatments he suggested.
0.600000	I think a doctor will do the best that they can do for someone or the best that a person will let the doctor do
0.520000	They are pressured by time to see the next patient. They have limitations from keeping up with every change in science and medicines. 
1.000000	I trust my PCP because when it comes to his patients he is very thoural. He does what is best for the patient. He also discuss a plan of care with his patients.
1.000000	He knows me, been a patient for years and never had a bad experience. He is kind, a Christian and I trust everything he says.
0.680000	He's done well with me.. But as I watch my mom begin Alzheimer's my belief in our doctor is dying. He did a test but she passed. It was picking up a piece of paper off the floor.. hmmmmm I know it might be hard to detect... but Doctors should know more about this problem.  
0.800000	doctors have the education that is why it is not easy to become one. all the classes you have to complete.
0.440000	I am not one to question life I take what it gives me and when life gives me lemons a I take em and make some damn lemonade out of em
0.800000	They're licensed. They know what will be best for you in terms of the medical field. They studied medicine for years compared to you that probably did not hence, why you are consulting a doctor.
0.680000	She listens to my needs and trys to get to the root of the problem and orders tes%s if applicable and she if affiliated with the neareat hospital
0.840000	She will spend as much time as necessary with all her patients, so you dont mind the wait, because she listens to all your concerns and will suggest a specialist for anythig out of hr expertise.
0.600000	No human is infallible, and too often people in positions of power, such as a doctor, can get a bonus for encouraging certain courses of behavior. I like to do my own, unbiased research instead of blindly following new orders. 
0.640000	they worry more about the general public or what people think about things a prime example to me is pain meds 
0.640000	I live in Racine WI. Our primary hospital was bought out by Wheaton Fransiscan. They refused to pay the best doctors what they are worth, so, hence, those doctors left town. They were replaced by doctors who got bs and cs in college. Many have a very hard to understand accent. ALL act like they are on a stopwatch
0.920000	They have always taken great care of me & my family. My doctor has been in the family for several generations. He knows our history very well.
0.600000	I think doctors ca n be trusted in general. I do think they hurry you out more quickly than they should to maintain their schedule...which is wrong. I think doctors rely ro heavily on the patient to know what to ask, instead of asking the pertinent questions themselves
0.520000	I don't have a primary care doctor. Why not? Because I basically don't trust them, they did no good for my mom, told her it was all in her head. She had MS
0.840000	I trust my Primary care physician, because Iam still alive. My always shows patience and kindness while staying professional
0.320000	They do not listen to me and I feel that they really do not care to try to understand what I am trying to tell them.  It makes me feel like I am not making sense of what is happening to me. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she always gives a lot of choices and me which one is best for me
0.600000	trust because they should know what they are doing in there field. if they don't then they don't need to be in the health field
0.800000	I have a very good doctor, we have been together for over 20 years. H knows my case history and is a very good doctor
0.720000	I  have  never had a  bad  experience  with  my   doctor   I  trust  him   completelyif  you  don't  trust  your  doctor  you  shout  not  go to  him
1.000000	never met a doctor who is as thorough or takes the time with me to male sure i understand everything going on with my condition
0.840000	This is hard because my doctor of over twenty odd years recently retired. I have only seen my new doctor a couple of times. But she was recommended by my previous doctor, so my trust is heightened. I guess it is safe to say that in general, I trust all doctors to know what they are doing.
0.640000	Sometimes I feel like certain doctors I have been to, just want to get you out of the room. They don't seem to be paying attention to what I am saying. 
0.560000	Previous experience in which a major medical issue was overlooked for years resulted in me not trusting doctors
0.640000	I trust the doctor because she seems sincere.  She has a no waste time approach and although I think she is giving me the bum's rush at times, she has never been wrong in her prognosis.
0.400000	I do not have 100% trust in my doctor because she just sends my blood work in the mail & never explain how I can do better I have to figure it out on my own & when she give me prescriptions she never check my paper work to even see if it has something in it that I will have allergic reaction to it or not.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he/she allows me to make decisions within my rights, but makes recommendations  that he feels would best suit my body and well being. 
0.840000	Sometimes I don't think he tells me everything I should know. It seems the doctor knows everything about you but is unwilling to tell you what he knows. The seem to hide your charts from you and sometimes never tell you your blood pressure or really how you are doing.
0.920000	My Dr explains the good and the bad.She's doesn't sugar coat anything. I trust her,she's easy to talk to
0.880000	He has never told me nothing false and is straight forward with me and my health is pretty good according to him and he never sad or did anything for me not to trust him
0.800000	My Dr is fairly new to me so i am learning to trust her in all matters.  So far she has been on target
0.760000	I have completely trusted my physicians in the past.  We just moved so I am still trying to find a physician I can truly trust.
1.000000	I have an excellent doctor who always takes all the time I need at my appointments and from past experience has been very helpful in any condition I am seeing him to be treated.  Feel very comfortable and trust his decisions in my care.
0.640000	I trust my doctor as far as he wants the best for me. However, he is limited in what he knows. He does not want to say outright that he does not know what to do but he just doesn't know everything. There is just too much to know that no one man can grasp it all. He will suggest herbal supplements but he is not knowledgable about them. He only knows his drug options. I really only go to him when I think I know what is wrong and he can verify it with blood tests or something.
0.760000	To me it seems like my doctor is always looking out for the best interest of me and my health. My doctor has been there the past few years and most of my major medical issues and has given me excellent advise that I have followed and improved my overall health.
0.720000	I trust my doctors but you always need to have common sense when it is about your heath. I just don't take what they say ad not do any research on my own.
0.520000	Sometimes they are very dismissive of me and my concerns but will only care when it is convenient for them
0.920000	Doctors are generally better educated and up to what's current in health care.  I have trusted my doctor for many years now.  He was the first one to recognize that I needed surgery.
0.920000	I trust Mt physician because they are very thorough and tell me the truth they answer my questions at all times
0.760000	I have been around the medical community for a long time and would trust the training of doctors more than myself or the internet. 
0.920000	I trust my oncologist to treat me in a way that if best for me. She makes sure I understand everything and takes the time to listen and respond in a way that is clear to me.  I feel that she cares and does not rush me through my appointments.
0.840000	I trust my physician because he knows everything about me and he gives the correct treatment what ever you are suffer
0.600000	I trust my doctor to always be truthful with me and I always tell him what he needs to know. I've been going to my doctor for years and I trust him
0.960000	While both my wife and I are under care with the VA system, both our doctors spend the time needed to explain what's going on, why something is happening, and the best path to follow, particularly conserning my wife's ongoing condition.
0.920000	I totally trust my physician because he is dependable, intelligent, caring, and just a great man. He is versed in his profession and moreover very easy on the eyes.
0.760000	I have made substantial progress with my physician in reaching my health goals.  We have good communication between both of us
0.600000	I do not have any medical problems. I do not visit hospitals or doctors. I do not have a primary physician.
0.800000	My doctor seems to care about me and my conditions. He does not rush through talking to me and actually listens to what I have to say. 
1.000000	"My internist is always honest with me about any tests or diagnoses he provides.  He tells me options with meds, testing, surgeries, etc, then gives me the choice of how to proceed.  He never ""talks down"" to me, and explains thoroughly. He keeps good track of my health, immunizations, mental health, medications and tests.  He follows up with me after most visits to see how I'm doing."
1.000000	been with my doctor for 5 years and he's great at what he does always answers my questions and my commonlaw wife has him also a a primary physician
0.600000	I trust him because he listens to me and answers questions I have. he is polite and not pushy if I don't want a certain shot
0.680000	I believe most doctors only have the patient's best interest in mind. I just don't believe you can trust any one completely.
0.640000	"i think more than the majority of doctors care about their patients but that they are stretched in time needed to actually give the right amount of time to the care of a lot of situations and rushed. i have to trust in the doctors i have. some are better than others but the extent of what is needed to become a doctor entitles the doctor to depend on that trust and my giving it to him. if i knew what was wrong with me, i wouldn't need a doctor but i do know my body and what is going on in it and need to let him know so he knows where to start to ""fix"" me, and also follow his directions. it does make it hard to trust anyone that is in charge of your health and how you feel, live or die when they have not the time to really know their patients and sometimes therefore form clinical decisions that are not necessarily the best answer for them causing the patient to mistrust his doctor. i feel i have no trust but to try to or change doctors."
0.960000	We have known him for over 20 years and two wonderful children and he has never been wrong with us. We trust him with our lives and children
0.720000	I trust my doctor with my medical condition because I hope the know what they are doing and have the knowledge and tools to help me if I have test done or a sickness. If I have doubts or distrust than I will sure to make sure I get a different health provider or doctor
0.720000	They have experience but very alert of some doctors but mostly they are trustful and put their patients first 
0.960000	I have a long relationship with my doctor.  I have every confidence in her ability to research and diagnose conditions.  She is a very respected and knowledgeable phycisian
0.760000	Because if he doesn't come through with being honest, I will own him...I will sue him into oblivion, and I will have his medical license yanked.
0.920000	my primary care physician takes time to talk to me and helps me understand what the medications she prescribes are for and how they can help me. she seems to care about my health.
0.600000	I am neutral in regard to this question, for I at the present time do not possess a primary care physician.
0.720000	Doctors in general are trustworthy.  They spend a lot of time in school and in practice.  They see lots of different things that happen to people and gain knowledge from those experiences which they can draw on to diagnose ailments.
0.480000	I do trust most things she tells me, but feel she does not take the time to be thorough in her assessments. She always seems to be in a great hurry to be done with the exam.
0.640000	healthcare profession is doing the best that it can, the situation at times for them can be limiting and handcuff much of the industry.
0.760000	A primary care physician is something like an immediate or emergency physician. It is to which we go first and these doctors see the seriousness of the health problem
0.600000	I rely on my doctor to select what s/he thinks are the three best treatment options for me based on what s/he knows about me.  However, I expect her/him to review the pros and cons of each option, entertain my question/s and then let me pick the treatment that I think is best for me.  If my medical professional can not help me navigate that process then I do not trust him/her and would look for a new PCP.
0.600000	i trust my doctor - he has never lied to me and always is there when i need him - i can call and get an appointment the day i call
0.600000	I do not really have a doctor.  I have a physician's assistant.  There is a doctor there, and he is listed on my card.  However, I do not see him.  I see the physician's assistant.   She is very considerate and helpful.  If I have a need for anything, I can email her which is very helpful because it is hard for me to hear on the phone.  She usually gets back to me in a good amount of time.  She answers my questions the best she can.  
0.720000	I trust my Dr to a certain extent, I don't believe in taking so many different medications just to treat minor issues
0.520000	At the time I wasn't going to my primary doctor but I was pregnant and I guess I was taking off my mom's insurance so I couldn't make an appointment until they fixed it. Well when I finally got back on it and had an apoointment, instead of checking on the baby we just did a pregnancy test and questionnaires.  Second appointment was once I started losing him. They did a ultrasound and said he was fine. Later that day I had a huge headache and threw up the next day I was fine. That following Thursday he came out too early. When I told them my water broke they didn't try to help me. I had to take a picture in order for moves to be made. The nurse wouldn't tell me a gender. They never asked if I wanted to hold him or bury him. He was still attached to his cord and the placenta was somewhat still inside. For about 4 hours my son sat in between my legs with the placenta still inside of me. Once they finally found that type of doctor she took the placenta out and basically dropped him on the floor. I feel more should've been done that first and second appointment and both trips to the er. Then the following month they thought I had a std. Everything came back negative but no further tests on me as to why i had all the symptoms and why my son came out so early.  I had about 4 (I forgot what it's called but you get it often when you're in your 30s) last summer. Soon in August or September I had a follow up and he was a boy and there wasn't anything wrong with him. I knew that when we saw him on the ultrasound. He was alive and active. 
0.560000	I find that doctor rely most on what they are taught in medical school, which are mostly funded, staffed and run by pharmaceutical companies.  They tend to ignore holistic approaches that are not approved by the FDA and yet numerous studies have proven they work. 
0.760000	I do trust my Doctor,he is always making sure to check on everything like Blood Work and xrays or ultrasounds to get to the answer that we are seeking
1.000000	I have been seeing my doctor for 6 years and she has always gone above and beyond for me as a patient, whether it be helping improve my illness or offering advice on other matters. Not to mention that my health has undergone tremendous improvement
0.760000	my dr is conservative-He does not jump to meds etc That approach is equal to mine so we are on teh same page  He is a caring man also
0.600000	I trust my primary physician because he listens to me when I tell him something and he gives me different options to choose from for my treatment. If I have a problem with the treatment I can always notify him and he will recommend something other treatment.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he has been my doctor for many years and I'm still alive. I trust none doctor to take care of me n cause he's educated and experienced. 
0.960000	I finally found a doctor that doesn't only wants to prescribe more medicine.  He agreed with me that some to the prescriptions I was taking I did not need.  He  and I agree that there is only one that I do need.  Finally a doctor that is not a pill pusher.  
0.960000	ive been with her and my other specialists for a long time theyve been and  seen me through several serious ailments
0.800000	I don't know; they're honest and trustworthy and I find them believeable. I don't know what else I can say.
0.520000	I generally just my primary care physician, because I've had good experiences with her for the most part, but she did let me down in a big way recently and that's shaken my trust in her. I'm also having problems with another person I see, and it's making me trust medical professionals less because she's so bad.
0.880000	i trust my doctor because he is a good hearted person very honest person my doctor is always nice and patient with me

He is always willing to spend the time to listen and explain everything to my satisfaction.
0.760000	Sometimes she doesn't always get things right, but most of the time she does.I trust in her ability to find the best solution. 
0.600000	I use the v.a hospital for my Drs. I just moved from Michigan to Tennessee & the Dr here is not staying on her job very well
0.720000	My primary care physician wasn't honest in a medical report over a small issue which causes a patient to mistrust!

0.600000	Doctor's are too tied to pharmaceutical companies so that has to be taken into account and I prefer to avoid meds whenever possible.
0.440000	The doctors are just for a paycheck and they really dont care about their patients.  It is sad that they dont have a caring heart.  I rather go to a doctor who really cares and not looking at you as money in their pocket
0.600000	She is helping me with my condition and she has more knowledge in that area than i do, so i trust her that she is doing the right thing.
0.600000	"Trust is a two way street.  The doctors do not trust you when you are in pain.  Because they do not trust you when you are in pain, the doctors decide that it is a good thing to poke and prod you until you actually scream.  After they hear you scream, they then decide that ""oh, maybe you are in pain"". That is when you will be given a hand full of papers otherwise known as referrals, to go to a place where they do x-rays.  After signing in with them, you have to fill out all of the paperwork once again.  It is a tedious job to continue to fill out the same forms over and over again.  The referral doctor takes the x-rays, and tells you to make an appointment with your original (primary) doctor.  The doctor that tells you to make the appointment with the primary doctor will then read your x-rays and send the results to your primary doctor. It seems to me that the primary (original) doctor is just sending you back and forth to different doctors to get additional payments from the insurance company.  I just do not trust any doctor.......they are all out for themselves."
1.000000	My primary care Dr. always takes time to LISTEN to me, and explains any medical issues to me in  terms that I understand.
0.800000	Ive known him and have been seeing him for a long time. I have no problems telling him exactly what bothers me. I trust him to be right most of the time.
0.320000	The last time at the physician's office my doctor gave me the same medicine that I was given at the hospital.  I went in for knee pain and unable to walk. I had the results sent to my doctor's office, but she didn't even remember looking at them. She didn't send me to get x-rays, MRI, or anything else.  Still having knee pain and very hard to walk.
0.800000	She actually cares, she listens to resolve instead of listening to respond. She allows me to speak and fully explain myself without cutting me off like most doctors. 
0.640000	I really love my primary care physician. She is careful and thoughtful, but she is only human. I know she will do her best by me, but that doesn't mean she is always right.
0.520000	I have never had a doctor that I trust 100% because they are human beings and they see a lot of clients in one day and have made plenty of mistakes. It is up to me to stay vigilant and decide on how to proceed based on my doctors suggestions.
0.600000	I like my primary care physician, but I don't really trust the technology that is used.  I don't trust that information entered into computers is always correct and not entered into someone else's account.  I would not trust everything that is done or said if it didn't seem to make sense.
0.760000	Shes nice and kind to me. She makes sure that my needs are taken care of and she listens to what I have to say and what questions I may have for her.
0.320000	Most docs where I live care about money, not their patients. There is very little access to a large health system in South Carolina where I reside and what we have is what we have. If you have to go to the ER it's best to go over the border to North Carolina than to go to Piedmont. 
0.480000	I have a general distrust for those with medical training. This is caused by a negative experience with a doctor that I had as a teenager.
0.600000	My care physician is the closest I can get to without having to drive almost 100 miles round trip. The clinic that my doctor is based at is always over crowded and busy so I rarely get much time with my doctor. She tries to do what she can for me but she has admitted that it has not been easy since more and more paper work has been added to her daily work and she was forced to take on more patients than she can handle. My doctor is wore out most of the time and often times I have to mention things like possible blood work that should be done or scans because she won't always think of them. She has too much on her plate and it is hurting her patients overall.
0.640000	I trust my doctor but I feel like I'm certain situations like if I had cancer or something serious, I would look into my options.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he is a professional.  I am also in good health so I know that I am not at risk.
0.920000	I have been with her for 20 plus years and our relationship has grown to the point that I know she will not bs me on any issue
0.480000	My Doctor seems very lackadaisical to me. Going through the motions while trying to act interested in what I am saying.
0.720000	nothing like that i can feel the importance and trust mmyself very easy so am saying that very confidiently that i can do all by myself
0.800000	He is thorough and answers questions also personally calls  with test results Will take time to explain tests ordered and why. Always feel he has time to listen appointments are never rushed
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician although it sometimes hard to understand her. She is not from America. She is Indian.
0.720000	some of the doctors are very trusting and some can be not as trusting and they have sometimes they kist think that its okay but i know better and i would get another opinion sometimes .
0.880000	i trust my doctor  they know what they  are doing most doctor u can trust and u can relie  on them for medicial needs
0.600000	They make matters worst. They don't want patients to get well.  Money is only on their mind.  They don't fully try to understand the patients' needs.
0.520000	"My Doctor is extremely overbooked and is always trying to get me out of his office as soon as possible. He interrupts me constantly when I am trying to describe why I am there. He does not answer any questions I may have ""telling me to ask the nurse:."
0.480000	My primary care is good enough.I really rely on my heart doctor though.My primary can be dismissive,abrupt and officious.My heart doctor is gentle ,sensitive and caring.
0.800000	I believe my physician has my best interest at heart and tries to offer the best professional help as possible.
0.760000	A primary care physician (PCP), or primary care provider, is a health care professional who practices general medicine. PCPs are our first stop for medical care. Most PCPs are doctors, but nurse practitioners and even physician assistants can sometimes also be PCPs.
1.000000	I very much trust my doctors at the VA,  they have been unreal kind, right on & always right.    Everything I've had done there has been great & right on with what they say.  I'm completely happy..
0.600000	i trust my doctor fully...if i didn't i would switch doctors as soon as possible.... i have had my doctor for most of my life
0.880000	We discuss what I should be doing at my age in regards to health screenings and such be he always leaves it up to Me he gives the pros and cons , but he has no agenda other than to inform me which I like
0.600000	Because she does not listen to what i have to tell her . she tells me i should go see more doctors like im made of money.
0.680000	Because theybcan totally lie to you but yeah uavent you heard of doctors lying their patients like dude that's why slwmtimes you can't just trust undone like make sure you asked of their degree and look up there history 
0.960000	"Very caring.  His words to me were ""I'm going to treat you like I would treat my Mama.  And I love my Mama.""  He has even called me at home after hours to make sure I am okay."
0.640000	I trust them but sometimes they want test that I feel are unnecessary that cost me to much money that I do not have and the test come back ok anyways
0.640000	i have know my doctor for many years, trust all his recommendations and scripts.i have referred friends and family to see  also.
0.600000	I don't trust the newbies sometime because there new but I feel like why would a doctor deliberately
0.760000	I just recently started to see my doctor. He seems to have a good bedside manner. He spends time with me and listens and is trying to help me resolve my issue 
0.680000	I mostly trust my doctor, but sometimes I feel as though the doctor may think some of the things that are bothering me are insignificant.
0.960000	I feel that they know what they are doing and really listen to my input and take that into consideration.
0.360000	I was diagnosed last year with NF 1.. instead of my doctor trying to get me to a genetics doctor who specializes in what is wrong with me all he would do is say I had a patient with that once.. no test, no scans, no mri's, nothing to see what is going on inside.. I would show him the tumors on the outside of my spine and no reaction.. just I use to have a patient with that..
0.480000	Doctors are only in business because people are or think they are sick. You go to them for one thing & immediately they want to send you for testing to see if they can find something wrong. I feel if it isn't broke don't try to fix it. There is a lot of truth in the statement what you don't know won't hurt you. Some people make themselves sick because they worry what if.
0.400000	Because I hate people and no one truly cares about u unless they love you. People become doctors mostly for the paycheck 
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he's been my doctor for many many years and knows me.  My only concern is that he sometimes deems my problems less serious than I do.
1.000000	My doctor seems to have a genuine interest in my well being. I am open and honest with him which I feel is rare in patient-doctor relationships. I don't see any reason for him to be dishonest with me. He takes time to know my needs and problems so he can effectively treat them.
0.520000	Im in the middle.  I trust him because he is a physician and he tries to make my health better.  In a way i dont trust him because he doesnt give me more alternatives to make my health better
0.600000	Usually my doctor has been spot on with any diagnosis and knows her stuff. Just wish she was a little  more  personable  and not rushed.
0.800000	I jave changed doctors several times in order to find my cuuent one.  She listens and doesn't just push pills.
0.520000	I do not think that doctors much care any more. I think they are short on time and just need to earn the dough. 
0.600000	At the moment I do not have a doctor.  The one I went to for many years retired a few years ago.  I have not needed one since that time.
0.520000	Do not always feel he is listening, but he does often get back to me after investigating certain things.
0.920000	because i feel we have a great relationship beyond patient and dr. i feel he is my friend looking out for my health and well being
0.840000	she is very through and knows exactly what my needs are and recommends specialist that I need to see for any problems she knows I need. she follow ups with my blood work to see if my meds needs to change. she ask me if i'm having any problems since my last visit and what is going on with my current health issues.
0.800000	I have been with my doctor for many years; we trust each other and work well together, also have mutual respect

0.360000	I have been going to my primary care care phycisian for many years. He has helped my husband and I through several problems. I had one problem that he could not solve and he kept sending me to different specialists. After 3 years finally found the one in Dallas that immediately knew what my problem was. After open heart surgery he found a problem my husband had that the heart surgeon and heart doctor had missed. So yes I completely trust my family doctor. 
0.600000	Doctors are practicing physicians and to me that means they are still using us as experiments to see what will work and what will not work.  There are to many side effects for the drugs on the market to be prescribed for anyone there are more side affects than cure and the doctor knows this but yet they prescribe these medication for people what ever happened to using more natural products like the olden days.
0.840000	My doctor is an exception to the rule; she is interested in what I have to say and the questions I ask and is in no hurry to rush me out.  She leaves when I signal that I am satisfied with my visit.
0.400000	My primary care physician didn't thoroughly investigate my son's condition when I brought him in. She just assumed it was the Flu because of the season. My son was later diagnosed  with a Pneumonia.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he always gives me options on treatments. he tells me the pros and cons of each type of treatment offered. He lets me choose what I feel is right for me.
1.000000	I have had my oncologist for the last 5-6 years and I trust his opinion and I trust his treatment for me I have cancer my life is in his hands so I trust them
1.000000	My doctor takes the time to explain options to my condition and never tells me what option I have to take.  She recommends what she thinks is the best option, but has no problem if I select another option. 
0.680000	been wit and hah him for 35 years he has helped me with so many health problemsand never steered me wrong
0.760000	my reasoning to why i trust my primary care physician is because she makes feel like i can be open with my doctor. 
1.000000	I trust my doctor as she listens to my concerns and addresses them with testing and the specialist I need. I have became better health wise since being under this doctors care
0.600000	Some doctors I feel rush through the appointment and I leave feeling uncared for which is not the purpose for my visit
0.800000	Because he never really can tell me what is wrong with me. And I can't understand him clearly which bothers me. And he always blows me off
0.840000	of course i trust my doctor i have chosen him  because of his good fame and he always give me the right treatment.
0.680000	i trust my pcp because i have not had a reason not to when it comes important things in my life that could meen life; or death.i do get nervous when it comes to something major though.
1.000000	I have been seeing the same physicians for over 30 years. I have complete trust in them and am comfortable that they treat my family as well. I would be very disappointed if I had to find another physican(s).
0.880000	I'm lucky that I have not had to go to see my doctor often. I see a nurse practitioner and feel that see is totally competent and I trust her to give me the right diagnosis.   
0.720000	My doctor seems to have a thorough plan for my various ailments and seems open to any questions that I have.  I don't feel rushed by him during the appointments.  He is personable.

0.240000	when i told her i had a cardiac problem she said i didnt. i ended up in the hospital for a cardiac ablation. she was told by my mental health doctor to check my thyroid, she didnt. when the cardiac ablation was done and bloodwork by the hospital they told me i had a thyroid problem.
0.920000	I trust my Rheumatologist and my Nephrologists because they got me on the right treatments to steady my condition to were I am more balanced mentally and physically.  
0.600000	I feel like they are doing the best they can, but are overworked and quality care is diminished, that does not mean that I distrust my doctor by any means, I just know mistakes can be made because they're only human.
0.600000	good experience in the past and a relationship of several years; i trust they are educated and continue to update their knowledge
0.840000	I known my doctor for over 10 yrs and they will go over my meds and tell me if it's unhealthy and who is better and make sure I'm happy or not
0.960000	stop asking for such long answers to these questions   my doctor never steered me wrong  blah blah blah
0.960000	My doctor has a great reputation with his patients.  He's been a great doctor and has treatment effectively when other doctors have not been successful.  He makes sure I understand everything before leaving his office.
0.200000	Physicians, doctors, pharmaceutical industries and pharmacists are not trustworthy. They work together in their individualistic pursyits. The patient is not primary goal, their money being pocketed is. 
0.760000	I have no problems so far. I have been with my doctor for a little over 2 yrs now. I think he does a good job and would recommend him, and have. 
0.600000	I am just a person the Doctor puts my name in the computer.  What happened to the good ole days when the Dr. Looks at me instead of the screen.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she truly cares about my well being.  If a medication is too expensive/not covered by my health insurance, she will suggest a generic alternative that works just the same and saves me money.
0.720000	I believe that I trust doctors in general because they have more knowledge that pertains to the situation that I might find myself in. They have endured the proper schooling and training required that qualifies them to make diagnoses, and give medical advice. They are professionals for a reason. 
0.800000	I have been with him for many years. I have done just about everything suggested and I am in pretty good health
0.600000	I do not have a primary doctor at this time, just lost my health insurance and moved to another state, but my previous doctor was ace all the way.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she has never done me wrong. They have gone above and beyond to help me, and get the proper care I need.
0.560000	All doctors tend to have their own way of doing thing and thinking about issues. I feel like it is safe to say that they do not know everything and can be wrong just like anyone else.
0.560000	I don't think most physicians are as up to date as they should be or as willing to look into the issues that they should always
0.880000	I have never had any reason not to trust what my Doctor tells me. He has always been very straight with me about everything.
0.520000	To rushed with dealing with too many other clients every day of their lives also tyhey do not really carte since they all drive BMW;s every day..

0.760000	I have been dealing with my doctor for a very long time, over 30 years. We had many different discussions on multiple ailments, concerns, sickness, cures and how I feel. We always discuss how each cure, symptons, sickness and feelings and he has been thorough discussing what he feels that I need to do, actions that need to be done and when I have been sick he comes up with different suggestions that will assist or cure what ailes me. 
0.480000	The only reason I go to my doctor for a yearly wellness check up is because I have to in order to have my prescription birth control refilled. I don't particularly like my doctor and sometimes I feel like she doesn't know what she's talking about.
0.800000	I relay on the physician to make care of the situation that the doctor can determine to right medical knowledge best suited for me.
0.760000	my doctor has given me no reasons to doubt his thoroughness and ability to treat me.  I trust he gives me good advice and wants me to be as healthy as possible
0.720000	I have been seeing him for a couple years and he has helped me. When I didn't know what was wrong he did and he also helped point me to someone else who tried to help me.
0.720000	I trust them because they always give me the right medicines and treatments for any problems I have and go through. They are always there when I need her
0.800000	All doctor miss things on some patients that they deal wit they can't catch everything so if u smart enough to know something is still wrong even tho ur doctor told u that everything was ok u all ways go to a higher physician that can assist u better
0.720000	Doctors in general. Are great for the world.  89 percent of dr.s are good at wat they. Afew dr.s make mistakes as any other human.  Dr.s should continue to evalate their patients and keep saving lives. And also 
0.360000	If my doctor would try a little harder and ask the questions this survey has,  he might understand me more.  Instead he will ask two questions prescribe a pill and send me on my way.  
0.280000	I have found doctors are more interested in shoving pills down a patients throat than actually addressing issues that are causing the problems in the first place.
0.760000	My primary physician has a good bedside manor and takes time to listen and explain things.  She does not rush me.  She seems to have a good understanding of my health concerns.
0.680000	I generally trust my primary care physician but I also like to back up her information with what I can learn from trusted medical websites. I have only been with this primary for a year so I think we are still learning to trust each other. It can take some time to become really comfortable with each other.
0.560000	Sometimes my doctor doesn't remember my conditions and even though my chart is in front of him automated.  I have to remind him of my medical issues.
0.680000	My doctor has achieved a medical doctrine, that took years to get. I have to trust him to a certain point. Honesty if I have doubts then that's when I patronize a different medical establishment. 
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because we have worked together for a while and she knows what I need and she is always willing to help in any way she can

0.600000	I do not have a pcp, although  it rust that doctors do the best they can; unfortunately they do not know everything.
0.920000	Cause he never told me something that was wrong I have a lot of trust for my doctor until I am proving wrong I have high trust for my doctors 
0.840000	He's very sympathetic and a good listener.  I have been going to him over 20 years.  He's never steered me wrong
0.920000	I have recently acquired a new physician.  He is young and on the cutting edge.  He cares and is very attentive.
1.000000	Everything my doctor has done for me has turned out real well so i trust him completely. He explanins things to me so i can understand them and also lets me know what we are going to do in the long run for my treatment.
0.680000	He does listen to me and give me suggestions to solve a problem (see another doctor, specialist) but never has the answer himself.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician and most that I have visited in the past do not listen as well as they should.
0.840000	My doctor has a great track record.  He cared for my mother and for me.  Wouldn't give him up for the world.  He has stayed true to himself and others!
1.000000	I have been with  the same doctor for quite sometime now I have full trust in him and his staff has well has the hospital that he works for , I have never had any doubts with him
1.000000	I have never had a reason to distrust her. She has always been forward with me about all my illnesses. If one medication doesn't work, she has a lot more that she can tell me about. I always ask about possible side-effects and she always tells me.
0.680000	I trust my doctor as he has good reputation with patients,and i have found him to be quite honest,and straightforward in my treatments.
0.560000	my doctor gave me blood pressure meds that i almost died from, when i told her that it has an adverse effect on african americans she said she did not know about that, even though it was all over the paper.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for more than 10 years & he has helped me allot.  I can tell him I have a weird pain & he figures it out quickly.  
0.360000	I think the doctors that I have seen lately , let their degreesâ get in the way of understanding their patients needs, they are quick to offer solutions withoutâ all of the facts..not sure I trust many doctors
1.000000	Very good eye contact! Explains things carefully and completely, encourages questions. Not afraid to touch me! Takes his time, not in a rush like an assembly line.
1.000000	I think my doctor has a great deal of compassion and caring for all her patients...I know how she interacts with me and other patients and it shows she is a trustworthy doctor to all her patients.
0.600000	I truth my doctors they wont do anything that would hurt me they are there to help me not to do me any harm
0.760000	My primary care physician spends time with me in my appointments and explains every little detail about the procedures or treatments that I may be going through. She never rushes and she always takes time for my questions. 
0.760000	I have had my primary care doctor for q little over a year now. I am comfortable talking about him with anything at this point.
0.960000	I have been going to the same primary care physician for many years, probably at least 20.  I have always trusted what he has said about my conditions because they correspond with the test results I have received.
0.800000	I definitely trust my physician in the sense that they are well trained  and belief they are competent
0.800000	Well, this doesn't seem like a very good question to me. But I think that one has to trust their doctor or find another one to deal with. So what can I say. that is about it, about that........
0.720000	I'm not sure if I trust the Doctor.  Now a days, he checks things off on the computer, while asking me questions.  I can do that!  Is the system good or is the doctor??? I don't know!  ...not sure!!!
0.800000	My doctor has been my physician for over 30 years and he has always been very upfront and honest with his medical decisions 
0.600000	i dont typically go to a doctor something i need to start doing again in the very near future.. i was addicted to drugs and let my health go just began recovery getting back to health is important to me gain
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he always asks me if i understand or if i have any questions he is always following up with me and he is really nice
0.720000	I believe my primary doctor knows me well enough to know I want honest answers and the real bottom line, and so he does not sugar coat anything 
0.960000	Very likeable doctor. Really wants me to be in good health. I am overweight and he wants me to work on that.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because she is always looking for and telling me about things I can do to improve my health. 
0.640000	I trust doctors because they know what they are talking about and you can rely on them to keep your best interest at heart. 
0.560000	Don't have a primary care doctor now but when I did I was never sure if he knew what he was doing. He once ruined a trip for me with a bad diagnosis.
0.640000	Overall, I trust my primary physician but I don't think they always want to commit to a detailed answer.
0.440000	I think doctors are more interested in making money through prescriptions than the well being of their patients. They often are too quick to prescribe medication with bad side effects, or are uninformed about what would be best for the patient. Sometimes they prescribe medication that would react badly with other medication that the person is taking. Because of this I have to take what they say with a grain of salt. It's better safe than sorry so I trust myself first. Plus doctors might forget some of what they learned in school.  I saw one of my doctors looking up the answer to their question online
0.800000	he or she spent the time to do the hours for whatever good/bad reason to get the degree and then try to keep up, which maybe nerar imposssible
0.720000	I don't have a primary care physician. I haven't even been to the doctor since I was a kid. But I don't see any reason not to trust your doctor. What advantage could he gain by lying?
0.760000	I generally trust my physician because usually he will explain everything to me before any decisions are made. I think that they are knowledgeable and know what the fix should be. 
0.760000	I think my doctor cares about what is wrong with me but i feel he is to busy to listen one hundred percent. He is at a clinc for low income people
1.000000	caring and thorough and has really helped my husband and all his medical issues always quick to respond
1.000000	I've been with the same primary physician for 20yrs, I trust her and depend on her. She always has my best interest at heart.
0.920000	I just found a new PCP, because my old one was grossly overweight and seemed to not treat  patients as individuals; she wasn't always this way; I know she has some personal problems.  She was wrong about some side effects I was having, and wouldn't listen to me.  My new PCP is very thorough, is a good listener, and is helping co-ordinate my care with several specialists, after an unexpected hospitalization.
0.760000	I have been going to him for a long time.He respects and knows what kind of person I am.He always Nswers my questions listens to me and helps in anyway he can
0.680000	If I didn't trust my family physician, I would not continue to visit his office.  I have been blessed with very good health (no major illnesses, never had to take prescription medicines at age 76) so it is difficult to judge my family physician as to trust or not. 
0.840000	I have always had a good long term relationship with my PCP. I see him several times a year even when I feel fine. Health checkups, flu shots a vaccinations ...we are always on good terms. If there's a problem, he won't sugar coat it..he'll be direct and honest...I like that.
0.480000	I think my doctor does not have time for me.  I have to be my own advocate to find out what is wrong.
0.440000	He is always pushing me to have surgery. when my back hurt he said surgery, I said physical therapy and the therapy fixed it. he now says I need knee replacement now, but when I went to the orthopedic surgeon, he agreed with me and put me in physical therapy and I am much better. 
0.800000	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and explain things so I can understand
0.800000	Doctors in general, I feel, are usually professional and honest and I would trust them in diagnosing whatever issue I'm having.
0.760000	When it comes to protecting your physical health, being able to communicate with your doctor openly and without reservation is essential. When you have a primary care physician that you trust, you are more likely to discuss any health concerns that you have, ask questions about your treatment options, and comply with your doctorâs medical recommendations
1.000000	My doctor is thorough and honest with me, and discuuses every current issue if any, and reviews all issues in the past...so very happy with my care from my primary physician...
1.000000	She has always helped me out.  If she doesn't have the answer she sends me to a specialist.  She makes time to listen.
0.920000	He tells it like it is. He's straight forward no matter if it hurts your feeling or not.  He has always been honest to me and my husband 
0.760000	Seems nice and listens to me she reminds me of me physically so I can relate to her.  She is a female so it's nice that we can discuss colon topics 
0.800000	My doctor usually tells me everything that they want me to do and why I need to do this and why it will help me.
0.760000	I believe that most doctors sincerely care about their patients. A doctor should care about his/her reputation. I do not think doctors wake wanting a malpractice lawsuit. He/She will do their best unless there is lack of knowledge.
0.760000	My primary care physician is very easy to talk to and have discussions about any particular problem.  He is almost like a family friend.  We can talk about non-medical things, as well.
1.000000	My doctor has always helped me in any medical decisions I may have to make. I trust my doctor and she helps me in anyway she can
0.960000	My primary care physician always listens to me.  He always answers any questions I have about any of my health issues.
0.680000	He has always been honest with me. He gives the expression that he undetstands and cares about how i feel. 
1.000000	My PCP has done nothing but good in my eyes. He always does whats best for me. I switched doctors and my current doctor reduced the dosage of metformin form 2500 a day to 2000 a day during my first visit because it was an unsafe dose. My previous doctor did not know that.
0.880000	I trust my physician Because she asks the right questions and helps me out. She just doesn't rush through the appointments
0.800000	I had a near fatal stroke in 2012. After nearly 3 months in various local hospitals, I had to pick a primary care physician since I never really had one.  I picked my current doctor and haven't regretted it one bit.
0.720000	Giving me information about my laboratory results in a broad way and explains every detauls whats going on with my condition
0.800000	I don't have a pcp at this time.  However, while I have some good doctors and some not so good doctors, most of the time I have had exceptional care from my pcps in the past.
0.600000	"I have a disability and I have found that some doctors will try and say that it may be related to something else, and try to prescribe courses of treatment that are inappropriate and do not work. So some doctors will behave in such an unprofessional fashion, just so they can be credited with ""curing"" a patient."
0.600000	I trust my doctor enough, but I still can't fully trust everythig they say wehn it comes tp payment information and everything else I need to know. The overall feeling of not knowing everything is what keeps me from completely trusting them.
0.720000	I do not currently have a primary care physician, however, I trust most doctors to be caring and competent while I am proactive in my own care and research treatment options and ask questions of my physician.
0.640000	My primary care Dr seems to think I'm capable of more physical activity than I really am. My orthopedic surgeon knows exactly what I can do and is proud of my accomplishments.
0.680000	He listens to my questions and concerns and then tells me what he feels concerning them.  I feel he gives me his undivided attention.
0.920000	I have known my physician for over thirty seven years as I worked around him at the local hospital where we both worked .He is very informed of each and every health issue I have and if I need a specialist he is very forth coming in recommending one on my behalf
0.800000	I feel like they have my best interest at heart. I can trust that they know what they are talking about and are educated in their field so I don't have to worry about my health.
0.920000	I have been with her for years and have never know her to put me off or not listen. She listens to what I have to say and goes with me. Her medications are spot on and she has checked my record before we have an appointment so we do have to play 20 questions.
0.960000	I trust my doctor completely.  We have a long history of him helping me when I was seriously ill.  He has literally saved my life several times.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest.  He has never mislead at any doctor's appointment.
0.600000	I generally trust doctors. They're educated, but I also know they're human and can have biases that may sway the education or logic.
0.600000	I trust my doctors for the most part. I don't however completely trust medical science or drug manufacturers. Medical science just doesn't seem to have all the answers where many diseases are concerned and drug manufacturers seem to be more interested in profits than life.
0.280000	My primary health care told me not to read the inserts that come in your medicine telling you about side effects, they were for lawyers only
1.000000	I have been with the same doctor since I was a teenager and I completely trust him. I never   feel uncomfortable around him because, i know that, i can trust him.   I love my doctor and we share a very friendly relationship with each other at all times.
0.600000	I trust my doctor but due to him having so many patients I do not feel like I gte the most thorough of care. However here are not too many doctors to chose from that deal with my medical condition.
0.560000	I do not trust my primary care physician, but I do trust my specialist.  My PCP seems to be in a hurry and the practice is inflexible, and pushing tests/vaccinations I'm not interested in.  
0.920000	He knows me well and even asks me if I have researched something to enable us to better understand a subject
0.760000	I trust my doctor but I always do my own research about my health and medications. I have no problems asking if something is right for me.
0.720000	I trust my doctor's assesments completely although I often feel he knows more than he is willing to share with me
0.840000	I trust my doctor. She always tries to do what is best for me and addresses any of my concerns. She also listens to me and let's me explain any symptoms I've been having.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he always listens when I express concerns. He takes what I say into consideration and does not dismiss me rudely. He treats me as if he cares about me as a person not just a patient.
1.000000	I believe that the Veterans Hospital has the best Doctors and Nurses and they have been treating me very well for over 30 years
0.960000	My provider is thorough, is patient, has a good way of explaining things. She has a solid education and training and has not been wrong in diagnosing my health problems. 
0.720000	i have no response to this question because i feel every dr are sworn to be honest to every patient 
0.800000	She listens to me, repeats back to me my concerns and has given me no reason not to trust her. She takes the time necessary to understand my needs and questions
0.840000	I trust my physician because she genuinely cares about what is best for me and she always advises me to take extra precautions just in case because you can never be too careful.
0.960000	I trust all doctors to a point, and that point is there is a LOT of new information out there, new discoveries, theories and medicines. The average primary care physician cannot possibly learn it all.    When I had diverticulosus, the surgeon was going to remove part of my colon, and told me I may or not need a colonoscopy bag. I daughter and another friend looked up liposcopic surgery, and suggested that to drain the shit that was filling my abdomen. The surgeon agreed to try. It was successful. When he finished, the surgeon declared that if he ever had diverticulosus, he would want this procedure. I think we can trust our doctors, but we need to educate ourselves to make life better for all of us.
1.000000	"My primary care doctor has been part of my life for 26 years! He & I know each other well & have ""grown"" over the years."
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician moderately. I have so many health issues on going it is hard for her to keep up with what is going on. I went to have knee replacement surgery in February. Ended up having my ankle fused instead. Apparently I was walking on a broken foot and ankle for over a year. It was aggravating my knee issues. 
0.680000	I am a retired RN so I know a lot about medicine, I know the kind of questions I need to ask to understand my condition and I realize the physician works for me and I'm not intimidated.
0.720000	I feel like I am going through an express line in the food line. I go in he asks me a few questions, write a prescription and that is it. They do not get to know you personally.
0.720000	My doctor and my health care plan have a very good reputation. Therefore, I am trusting them for my Healthcare needs.
0.720000	I don't trust doctors because their not trustworthy I always trust my gut instinct. And I don't know why I have to type so much
0.520000	I have certain problems diagnosed and my Doctor has me come back multiple times to try new medicines instead of listening to what works for me. 
0.720000	My Doctor is very thorough and I trust his recommendations for treatments or prescriptions. However, I always do my own research and have refused drugs based on public evidence of problems.
0.560000	I think sometimes doctors get more money-minded than how they care for their patients. They have a tendency to sugarcoat whats wrong with a patient. I prefer that they are open and honest with me when it comes to mine and my familys health.
0.840000	I have known and used the same primary care physician for over 30 years. I have high confidence in my Dr. based upon many years of interaction.
0.560000	My doctor seems interested in moving people from the in door to the out door in record time.  He rarely gives more than ten minutes of time to his patients.  
1.000000	My doctor spends the time with me to not only get to know me but II know what my concerns are and delves into things that could be harmful to me and make sure that don't have things negative to my health that can't be seen on the surface
0.600000	I usually feel that doctors are in a rush and not always taking the time to get all the information to make a diagnosis or recommend treatment 
0.960000	"My PCP goes to great lengths to ask me in-depth questions whenever I go for my checkups; I'm rarely ill.  It's obvious that she's reviewed my history before I'm ushered into her office; she inquires about occurrences in my personal life as well as about my medical issues.  Most importantly, she actually listens to me and respects my opinions and wishes where medical options are concerned; she won't attempt to persuade me if I say I don't want to risk a med because of its potential side effects - she takes me seriously, unlike some doctors I've had in the past.  She's not got a ""cookie cutter"" all-knowing attitude."
0.800000	My primary physician and I are a team. He knows me well enough to suggest various options for health care with me first before just ordering test or medications. I normally tell him what is wrong and how I think I should be treated and he will either agree or recommend a different course. I trust his opinions and feel very confident in discussing issue with him if I have concerns about what he says to me.
0.760000	She tends to go above and beyond when it comes to finding treatment options that specifically help me both financially and mentally.
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for many years.  he has known my conditions and has had them treated as they should be
0.800000	My doctor always seems very concerned whenever I come in with a serious problem.  He listens to me & tells me what I need to know & do & is always very cordial & understanding.  
0.760000	My Dr is a great lady. She is baptized, filled with the Holy Ghost and really cares. on top of that she is beautiful inside and out. For the first time in a long time I am actually starting to fill better even though I have copd, Praise God
0.760000	good stuff sweet things nothing like it cool product so hard and classic make it happened cool things rare stuff all day
0.760000	They could be lying to me in order for me to spend more money with them.  They could fake that I have an illness, only to steal more money from me later on.
0.720000	i trust my doctor the are very good and care about my needs and questions.i see him twice a year and do tests
0.840000	I have been going to my doctor for years and have not had any problems. She tells me exactly what I need to do and why
0.960000	I feel totally confident with my doctor since it tells me clearly that it is what I have explains to me how the disease is and how it will cure me according to the treatment given to me
0.600000	My husband has a situation going on right now when it could be a bacteria (using a certain medication) or it could be an autoimmune issue.  It is all new to us and it seems that the doctor's sense of urgency is just not there .. probably because he has seen it all before where we would like more info, more tests ... more or different meds.
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. He takes the time to actually sit and listen to my concerns and thoroughly answers every question I have.  He is a doctor, and educator, a mentor and friend. 
0.680000	I am a skeptical person about everything really. I know it's not called for a lot of the time but I just can't help it. I often question whether or not the doctor has my best interest at heart. 
0.760000	My primary care physician as taken care of my family for years my mother and her mother both see the same primary physician 
0.880000	I   guess   all   I  can   say   is   that   the   guy   working   on   you  went    to  school   a  long  time   before  he   got   where   he   is   today   so   I  want   to   trust  him   or   her   completely , my   life   is   in   his   hands  on  Earth  but   ultimately ,  we   are   all   in   GODS   hands  and  when   HE   calls   us ,  its  time
0.800000	I would not be using the doctor if I did not have complete trust.  I have been with this doctor for 15+ years and she knows my history very well.  She has always explained things really well, especially when something out of the ordinary occurred,  When there was a problem, she found it quickly and was quick to act and resolve the problem.
0.800000	The only doctor I see is my dentist.  I HATE going to the dentist, and refused to go for decades.  Pain overrides fear to a point so I went.  I still get a nervous wreck when I go; but I trust him.   So far he has been very nice and careful.  He even gave me a free filling.
1.000000	I was diagnosed with breast cancer 17 years ago.  I followed my doctors suggestions regarding treatment & medication and am cancer free and have been for quite a while.  The doctor discussed and explained every in great detail
0.320000	I had little choice in who s my primary care physician, limited by my insurance.  He has a large caseload and cannot spend the proper time.  Also, he is careless and has often prescribed inappropriate medication that would have harmed me if taken.  Generally shoddy medical practice
0.760000	when visiting with him he spends a great deal of time explaining and going over all my questions and advises me of all the wrong things I do and tries to have me correct them
0.520000	I trust him because he is a good person and he has never been wrong in the past. About none of my medical history he is the best.
0.920000	My doctor understans and is careing about you i trust him to the fullestmy doctor care he stays the same make me want to go back
0.680000	As a patient, you have probably had the experience of meeting a physician for the first time and very quickly becoming comfortable that he or she has your very best interests utmost in mind. The sense comes quickly; you become comfortable, less anxious. Unfortunately you may have had the opposite experience of encountering 
0.360000	I do not have a primary care physician.  I am in reasonably good health with very little by way of health issues.  The last time I needed medical care I was able to go to the local urgent care office.
0.760000	I feel I must trust a physician.  If I feel something doesn't sound right about treatment, I would question the physician to find out pros and cons.
0.760000	I trust the doctors I see enough to keep going to them. I like the health system that I use I think they have really great nurses and doctors and a great reputable hospital. So I will trust them more than distrust
0.760000	i trust my doctor in y health care because he or she she know what they are doing that is all i have to say
0.960000	He does everything he can to make me healthy!  He provides all my needs and is always there to help!
0.920000	she seems to remember all the tiny details of my case. she seems genuinely interested in helping me to feel my best.
0.760000	I trust my physician because I have been seeing him for quite a few years now! As er say bedside manners in a dr is a must! Someone who shows you they care & what's best for you!
0.600000	My doctor tends to think clinically as opposed to holistic. That is, she would rather have take another drug rather than finding a solution that might be more healthy without side effects. 
0.520000	I don't usually trust doctors to treat patients as individuals, but instead use a one size fits all approach, by which I mean over-issuing prescription medications instead of offering alternative solutions for curing and/or managing health conditions.
0.840000	Doctor dont tell u everything they just trying to get paid just want u to take different medications
0.600000	My dr. Is ok but I'm not getting anywhere with her I feel like shot all the time and tell her how I feel and it seems like it goes in one ear and out the other without stoping
0.600000	Some of my specialists are excellent doctors, but others take an approach f get the meeting over with as fast as possible
1.000000	I trust my Dr completely, his communication with me is always good and I have complete confidence in his communication.
0.760000	Sometimes I feel my doctor does everything by textbook without looking at the whole picture.  For example, she was going completely by BMI without looking at my body type.  I have a LOT of muscle as I work out often.  After examining me she agreed with me.  
0.360000	He has prescribed me a medication that could have caused serious harm due to an interaction with another medication I was on, which he knew I was taking. He has also prescribed me a medication that could have prevented me from having more children and did not mention this. He is also not as knowledgeable about my condition as he should be given that he specializes in the area. He works at an office that has incompetent staff across the board. I would use another office if my insurance allowed me to, but unfortunately they are the only option. 
1.000000	My Primary care Physician is a HEALER, NOT A BUSINESSMAN, LIKE THESE YOUNG QUACKS THAT ARE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. Outside of my father, he is the finest man I have ever encountered. 
0.720000	I like my primary care physician, but I don't ever fully trust my healthcare to any one individual. Humans are fallible. I take my physician's advice, but I will separately do my own research and, ultimately, decide for myself and talk it over with my physician. If I disagree with them entirely, I will seek out a doctor that will oversee my care in the best way I see fit. 
0.760000	When I had a life threatening illness my doctor made sure they monitored my condition  every step of the way.
0.560000	I DISTRUST SOME DOCTORS THAT I SEE, BECAUSE THAY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH AND I FIND OUT FOR MY SELF AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT IT.
0.760000	If I didn't trust my physician, I would change to another physician.  I have stuck with the doctors I have because I have developed a trust for them and their judgement.
0.480000	I like him a lot and think he is good and means well, but he is always in a hurry and lookingâat the computer too much. I think he is overbooked.
0.640000	distrust has been established due to a mutual disrespect amongst myself and the non-medical personnel that staff the doctors office. As they seem to believe that they are well aware of how to treat me and better capable of handling it than I. 
0.240000	"She doesnt take the time to figure out my treatment optionsb she just goes with the first thing she knows. If she doesnt know of an alternative, she says its something i ""have to do"" regardless of negative side effects I've already experienced on that course of treatment. In my own personal reaearch i often discover multiple other avenues of treatment thay may work better for me, but she is unwilling to listen to my concerns."
0.520000	I sometimes trust doctors. There are good and Bad people in everything. Not all people are bad. I feel like they do the best they can to help people

0.760000	my doctor always listens to what I have to say.  If i have a problem I make sure to let my doctor know.
0.720000	My Doctor spends a lot of time listening to me which makes me feel as though she truly wants the best for me. However, now and then she writes referrals or orders tests that I never hear about again and had nothing to do with my complaints.
1.000000	My doctor and I have a very strong friendship as well as doctor/patient relationship. She listens to my opinions and thoughts and we make my health decisions together.
0.800000	She has always been open with me about her feelings and suspicions as well as the eventual official diagnosis. She treats me with respect, and, even though she knows more than me, she doesn't talk down to me when she explains things.
0.760000	I had a bad doctor, ended up almost dying because we (doctor and I) ignored my health. After getting out of icu, I changed my doctor and my attitude regarding my health. I an now back on track with a doctor who listens and makes me listen! 
0.720000	My doctor is very nice, she tends to be very caring straightforward, she never holds back information from me. She tends to be worried when I tell her something is wron
0.760000	I feel as though she listens to me and takes the time needed for my care. I do not feel rushed when I am see my Physician.
0.720000	I truly trust my primary care physician because they always provide me with all of the information that I need to stay up to date with my health 
0.760000	She listens does not make me feel in a hurry not many Doctors take the time to listen ,no useless test are done
0.560000	I mostly trust the doctor.   I believe with how the current healthcare system is, that there are unnecessary tests being done to give them extra money.
0.600000	i have a new dr so i trust her in a general way, don;t really know her. i do trust most dr.s Have had some good ones.
0.800000	I cannot imagine any physician not having a patients best interest.  There are many avenues to go if that is not the case.  
0.720000	I just started with a new facility for my medical care.  The two doctors I have seen there so far seem to be very nice and helpful.  This is a walk in place, where you see whichever doctor is there, you don't need an appointment.
0.880000	I feel that I can talk to my physician about anything and ask any questions relating to my health or how I feel.
0.800000	My primary doctor shows empathy and actually listens to what i have to say to him. He's honest with me about everything. He tries his best to help me whether its getting a referral to someone else or getting information for me.
0.760000	I see a do and not an md because a do treats the whole body and not just the symptoms.  I also see an acupuncturist on a regular basis.
0.560000	I know that doctors are busy and cannot know the details of every case. So asking questions to get more information can help. I don't think it is intentional, just impossible to have another person who rarely sees me to know what will be best for my life in some situations. 
1.000000	I trust my doctorsâ because they know how to take care of me, take care of my needs and give me the right medicines and care.
0.640000	I have been with my current primary care doctor for over a year and he is very trustworthy. He explains diagnoses and treatment options in simple easy to understand language i understand. 
0.800000	I feel that my primary care physican has my best interests at heart. He spends a lot of time with me and answers all my questions to my satisfaction.
0.720000	I've been seeing her awhile. We talk bout things. I just trust her.  She listens to me, we talk about each issue. 
0.600000	my doctor is very through in way he does, he has me come every three months for a check up and to get my meds refilled and every 6 months he does my yearly and checks my blood, urine and checks my prostate
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he has never told me information that he could not back up with scientific and medical proof.
0.760000	First off with my current Dr. I have researched that individual, and have spoken with people that have this particular Dr. as their Primary Care Physician. I check out the reviews online by individuals, and as well as the PCP's background information.
1.000000	I have had my physicial for many years and she is always receptive and explains everything to me in depth. I feel that I could reach out to her whenever needed.
0.520000	Sometimes people just look out for their own well being more than others no matter what profession. Also plenty of doctors have been wrong in diagnosing issues I'm having. They mask everything with medicine instead of treating the root cause. 
0.640000	I don't know that I actually trust my doctor, but I don't actually distrust her either. I guess I trust her to do what's best until she proves otherwise.
0.480000	"Primary care physicians usually are very straight forward with the facts and available treatments, but most are in and out types. Diagnosing the problem quickly without digging very deep into the situation, giving the usual treatment that has worked well for ""most others"" and not thinking whether or not the treatment would be best for you. "
0.600000	I had galstones in Sept. Of 2015 and my doctor thought it was an ulcer. This made me sicker for longer, and I couldn't get the care I needed. That's why I distrust doctors sometimes.
0.800000	i consider my doctor a friend. he is very open and honest to me even when he knows i might not like his advise.
0.600000	i see my doctor once a year she is very nice and easy to talk to good at having tests down and prescribes the medications i need
0.760000	Trust him because he will find the right medication instead of just giv g one and hoping it will eventually work. He also wants the right dosage and will keep checking to make sure they work
1.000000	i totally trust everyone of my doctors i know that they thinking more about me and my health problems
0.440000	I personally have had bad experiences with doctors, NPs not listening to what I am telling them. Doctors are constrained by a broken healthcare system, insurance system, so they cannot spend the time with patients, even if they have good intentions. the federal gov. is meddling in the doctor/patient relationship. 
0.760000	My primary care physcian always seems to care about. He always wants to make sure I'm telling him everything that is bothering me . Mentalliy and physically.
0.920000	She explains all my medications are for and what any procedure is for and why. I have trust in her. I can get appointment in between my regular appointments if needed without any problems.
0.680000	None i trust my doctor pretty well I have been going through the same doctor for years and I'm treated pretty good so far 
0.920000	My primary care person is actually a NP that i have been seeing for years. She gets me, my actual PCP supervises her but does not get me and i am not fond of her bedside manner.
1.000000	He never jumps to conclusions, he will talk to me about what ever it is and do tests if that's what is needed. 
1.000000	I have 4 very close drs that have been actively in my life one for 15 yrs  another for 14 and the other two i believe now 4 yrs. They know my body better than i do. I completely trust all 4 to any descisions may may conclude
0.640000	I don't trust them as much as I use tro. They do not take the time to learn about you and listen to your concerns it is a joke.
1.000000	He has helped with some of my medical issues when other doctors didn't. He listens well to everything I say and makes you feel comfortable. 
0.760000	I feel that she wants what is best and is honest and has my well being first when it comes to me and my health
0.840000	I feel very lucky to have the PCP that I see. She really listens to what I say and answers my questions. She doesn't rush through things to get me out and on to the next patient. She is thorough and I am always provided written documentation about what we discussed and any changes to medications. First thing she does is read the nurse's notes of why I'mâ there and the notes made at my previous visit. I get nervous any time I have to see any of my doctor's, but she and her staff treat me with respect and dignity which usually calms me. I have no complaints.
0.520000	I don't necessarily distrust my physician, but the medical field in general. I don't discredit their knowledge, but don't trust their motives. It's all about money to most medical practices.
0.560000	"The reason I trust and don't trust doctors is because I feel that a large majority of them are financially driven and often give responses to clients/patients based off of biases. I also believe that even some honest doctors tend to sometimes fall victim to having to concede to company policy's and ""unethical"" medical industry standards."
0.640000	I have had great doctors and I have had bad doctors. It takes research and checking them out before you trust a doctor.
0.760000	i would hope i can trust my physician, nobody really knows someone 100% so sometimes there is room for doubt
0.840000	I have bene going to him since I was 16 and he has always given me good advice and medicane to amek me better when I have been sick
0.680000	My primary care doctor gives me options to different medical situations; if she feels I need to see a particular type of specialist for my condition, then she refers me to one.
0.960000	I had a serious medical problem two years ago and my primary care doctor has been great with all the following up that has to be done and have explained everything to me the time.
0.880000	My doctor doesn't try to pressure or shame me into doing anything or taking any medication that he feels I need if I object. He respects my opinion.
0.680000	I really like my PCP. He listens and relys on my instincts as to what is going on. He is geniuinely nice and appreciative of my time and efforts.
0.800000	My doctor allows me to ask questions and help decide the right path for my physical and mental well being
1.000000	I can depend on my provider. I trust that my provider will steer me in the right direction. My provider has never given me at reason to have trust.
0.480000	I can't really say weather or not I trust my doctor because its usually always different. That's what I think I usually want a 1st 2nd and sometimes 3rd opinion 
1.000000	He takes the time to listen to me thoroughly.  He gives me advice that makes sense and has been proven to be valid and true in the past.  He cares about me (remembers things I have mentioned), and seems genuinely please when things are going well for me.  During one crisis I had about 5 years ago, he called me a few days later to make certain I was all right.
0.720000	I like him and have known him for 30 years. Not sure I trust him completely but he's pretty good. Needs to spend more than 10 mins. with each person...
0.720000	I see a nurse practitioner in a clinic and he always takes time with me, never seems in a rush. Willing to get things tested if I wish, if it's not an urgent matter. 
0.600000	I do not even have a primary care physician. I have not seen a doctor in years. I am in good health and do not need to visit a physician for any problems. 
1.000000	I have a new primary care physician who is very cordial, friendly, smiley, smart, and caring. He looks at you and listens carefully to what you say and responds very politely and respectfully. He explains things nicely and with details and examples. He takes his time with you and makes sure he's answered all of your questions before the session is over. He doesn't order unnecessary tests or medications. He is great!
0.440000	Doctors today spend too little time with each patient because they're in a rush to get to the next one. Doctors also hand out prescriptions for medications based on the added income they make for doing so. Its very difficult to rely on and trust the medical community anymore.
0.280000	"i don't trust someone that i can't understand. i don't appreciate being ""talked over"" because i am not understanding what they are saying. i will not go back to that doctor, unless i absolutely have to because i care about my life and well being more than some stranger with a diploma does. when i find a doctor that treats me like the intelligent human being that i am, i am more willing to listen and discuss my concerns with them. if not, they are plenty of doctors that i will go to until i find one willing to co-operate with me."
0.440000	she is curt, rolls her eyes when i tell her what is going on with my body, she is dismissive. she doesn't tell me stuff like do not  take your thyroid pill before your blood work, so my blood work is screwed up, i know she does not believe things i have had tested or experienced in the past are true facts. they are quite oddities and hard to believe, but yet all of them tested at least 3x before the dr's back then believed what was going on. it is my fault i am still with her, but my file could probably go around the earth once. i am lazy and honestly do not want to fill out new patient info sheets. when i do see a new dr, i have them send me the forms and it usually takes me about 3-5 days to fill them out.  i am content to know what i am dealing with my mean dr.
0.600000	Doctors are in it for the money from the health care industry. Doctors do not listen to their patients.  All they want to do is write scripts and not solve problems holistically.
1.000000	SHE IS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL RELAXED AND TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER ALL MY CONCERNS. SHE IS ALSO REACHABLE WHEN I CALL.
0.600000	I just feel at times I am more of a # than a patient. In and out quickly without always listening to me. I. The past I have had to go to the doctor 3 or 4 times for the same issue before that issue is actually dealt with. That sucks to me.
0.520000	I think most doctors are trying their best to provide good care but you really need to be your own advocate when it comes to your health. If something  doesn't  feel right or you are not getting better, get a second or even third opinion. 
0.680000	I trust that he knows what he is doing and that he wants whats best for me and my health. Ive also have never had a problem with my doctor.
0.840000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because I have been seeing him for a few years of my life. It's been enough time for me to gain my trust.
0.240000	they do not listen or read my chart when I tell them something, Its like I tell them and they look at me as if I have two heads
0.680000	I've been put on meds that ended me up having renal failure and hospitalized. I had another doctor prescribe something that didn't work well with another medication. I'm overly cautious.
0.760000	She has always been earnest with me about whatever I when to see her about. She has never beat around the bush when it comes to my health.
0.520000	I have learned that it is best to watch out for yourself  with the medical field.   Find out all you can about any treatments they suggest.
0.720000	he takes the time to listen and explore options with me. he listens thoroughly and consults when necessary
0.240000	I don't believe my doctor has read my medical history and pays any attention to me when I try to address it. The doctor is constrained by some CDC guidelines  which have left my issues untreated for years now and now I suffer more issues so I no longer trust my health care office and they also gave me a vaccine that I had refused for years and I decided to not worry about it until the bill came for $375 that insurance will not pay and that I do not have. I no longer trust them and don't feel I have anywhere to turn for medical care at this time.
0.200000	doctors dont seem to care like they used to.  They rush thru the appts just to make that money.  They dont listen nor do they act like they care about what you are saying.  
0.720000	Depends on the expertise of the doctor. If he/she is a specialist then I have a little more faith in the diagnosis. 
0.600000	i don't know my primary physician well enough as I never used him more than once a year so I really can't say.  Now that I'm older, I'll use him more
0.520000	I had a procedure done approximately 1 year ago. It could have been done in office with just a numbing shot. Oh no, the doctor wanted me in the OR with a local . I finally talked her into a spinal  just to shut her up. I am still angry and upset over the bill and the doctor not listening to me
0.680000	I trust them because I feel like they know what they are doing and how to approach a certain problem. I also trust them because previous treatment have turned out to be good for my problems 
0.800000	I believe in my doctor and she very thorough and I have confidence in her.  Whenever I hav had a problem she has always been right.  She is very cautious
1.000000	She is very smart about what is new .When ever I call emergency, she takes me on . She never knocks me down .Explains every thing an never rushes me out !!! 
0.920000	The reason I trust primary care physician is because because they always explain test, results and procedures in a way that I can understand exactly was is happenings
0.560000	I know you lying. I was just aBout to make sure you have to be a good girl. She said she was going to move up there for the summer. I was just aBout to get married. The only way to get my own place in the bed . U can be found in the bed and breakfast in the bed  
0.760000	he is considerate and open with helping me with my illnesses almost always right and usually gives me choices
0.760000	I don't necessarily distrust them, but overall they just want the salary and some of them are being paid by pharmaceutical companies for certain drugs 
1.000000	My doctor knows me and understands me.  He cares and is very educated.  He never talks down to me and talks in words that I can understand.
0.440000	I think doctors try to push too many drugs and don't give alternative and lifestyle treatments that would be better.
0.720000	I basically go to the doctors once a year and always listen and ask questions of my doctor.  We usually have a good conversation about different things and I walk away learning a new thing or two.
0.760000	I do trust him, but he is a GP and usually sends me to other people to really do a good physical.  Many things he has me do have all come out clear, yet I have spent a great deal of money doing all of his tests.
0.720000	I have not been with my primary care physician for a long time so I can't say that I fully trust him at this time.
0.600000	i trust her because she always listens to me and helps me out all the time makes sure that i feel safe and any test i want done or need done she does it i like it its nice 
0.600000	I have found in the past with primary care physicians I've had that they are interested in providing me with prescriptions I don't need and calling it preventative. 
0.680000	I believe that many doctors will run unnecessary tests to make a quota set my their practice.  For instance, a dermatologist may do a biopsy when there is not a good reason.   
0.440000	"I've had a bad history with doctors. They tend to condescend to me, to pick on me for my weight until I get compulsive and self-destructive about my eating habits, and give me drugs that wreak lasting havoc on my system and then just shrug it off (""Oh, well, that doesn't happen to most people.""). This one seems good, like he actually listens, but I'm still wary."
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician to try to do what is best for me. However I realize he may be constrained by insurance restrictions or influence by drug manufactures.
0.920000	I trust my doctor since i have enough time dealing with him and also i entrust is to my family and my friens and colleagues
0.560000	I often feel the doctor chooses treatments based on my level of insurance coverage rather than what might be best for me. I often feel the doctor is more interested in prescribing drugs for which the pharmaceutical reps have given incentives, even though I might not need them.
0.840000	I see a resident doctor that practices in a family clinic.  My doctor is supervised by experienced physicians.  I trust my doctor because she listens well.  She has supervision regarding her treatment decisions.  In addition, I have net some of her supervisors
0.720000	I don't really feel either, i don't know them enough but they do help if i need it.  they can guide me but don't just give me all the answers, and they have ok ratings.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because he has been the whole family doctor and has been treating me since birth also has answered all questions i've ever had bout me and my family members
0.640000	I don't know how you feel better soon to be the best for you and your mom is the best ot your life for the rest is just the way I can see the point in time for me today 
0.680000	I trust her and ask questions as I need to about health issues or concerns. I can ask questions about different medications or choices that I have   
0.520000	I mainly trust the doctors that I see or my children but I definatly make sure that we agree upon a treatment
0.760000	I ask a lot of questions about my health and usually am given the straight facts by my doctor. If I don't get the best answers I always ask for a second opinion. My doctor has been very upfront and completely honest with me on anything that we discuss.
0.880000	"I've dealt with a heart issue since I was 8 yrs old. Had a major ""episode"" almost 3 years ago & my current PCP has been very open about theories, treatments, test results & options. He has listened to my questions/concerns as well as let me participate in my care as far as refusing or suggesting a similar or different course."
0.720000	I tend to trust Doctors that listen to my concerns more so than Doctors that talk at me with a know it all attitude.
0.240000	My Dr. doesn't isten . He just gets in and out as fast as he can. I don't think he even really cares I am just more money to him. Ireally get upset. I wish he would take more time to pinpoint what is going on.
0.960000	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  I trust him completely for my care.  He does a great job.  I would listen to his advice and suggestions. 
1.000000	She listens to what I have to say and asks questions rather than jump to conclusions.  She also checks up with me yo see if the treatment we decided on us working or not, or hiw a consult with another doctor went.  She has never been dismissive of any issue I've gone to her with.  I feel that she honestly cares for my health.  
0.560000	I do not completely trust my doctors because I don't have a primary care physician and I see different doctors when I go to the doctor.
0.920000	It is his job to give his patients the best care and treatment. If not, he could be sued, and could potentially lose his license 
0.920000	I HAVE BEEN LUCKY DO TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS, THATS WHY IN TRUST HIM AND OR HER
0.880000	I trust my doctors they usually tell me the truth about my health weather I want to hear it or not i learned alot about my health by asking questions  also i learned alot of medical terms 
0.560000	it seems to work out just fine for me. I find that i can trust doctors pretty easily and have no issue in that regard because i have never had any reason to not trust them. so it works in my favor. 
0.520000	Don't always spend enough time or ask if you have any questions. Just want to get you in and out. Therefore how can one totally trust if they don't get to know you as a person.
0.720000	After listening to my concerns the doctor prescribed the medication that would best handle my medical condition
0.960000	I feel like I can trust my doctor because he sees you as a person and not just getting some kind of money benefit from his patients and cares for each one no matter who they are or the financial differences. He shows respect and trays to make everyone comftorable and like a friend.
0.440000	At times, my doctor seems more focused on generating money than actually treating me. I have had several tests that seemed unnecessary. 
1.000000	He is friendly and really interested in what you have to say and is never hurried when speaking and treating me,   He diagnosed my wife's condition just by looking at her after several other doctors had no idea what her medical problem was.
0.440000	I recently had to switch primaries and she isn't as easy to talk to nor as thorough. I always feel rushed when I see her
0.480000	Doctors are good for diagnoses, but prescribing medication is one thing I do not trust doctors in this area. I believe medications are prescribed for the doctors benefit, not the patient.
0.680000	my doctor is human and even though researches the products still want to make a quick buck and ginipig pig us patients
0.800000	She takes the time to read about my cases and issues before we meet.  We generally has several solution to the problem at hand....but to be honest with you I am very healthy for my age, so I only go to the doctor for an annual check up at this time in my life.
0.920000	I trust my mental and physical doctors as they seem very concerned and helpful, even tho I may not agree with them., I feel they are straight forward with me and my problems
1.000000	I trust my doctor i know that wind i go see them she take her time in doing what she do make shore all my test are up to date
0.600000	I haven't been seeing him long enough to completey trust him.  I had a doctor before him who I thoroughly trusted but she left.
0.880000	My doctor usually takes plenty of time to talk about my concerns; I almost never feel rushed. She is kind, concerned and considerate
0.560000	I trust doctors to a point. However I feel that they do not always listen and just generalize your condition. They lump you in with other patients they have experience with
0.760000	I guess I was always raised to have the utmost respect and trust in my primary doctor. they have never given me any reason to distrust them. I feel very comfortable with their opinion on all things .
0.440000	I trust them a little but often feel they want to rush to get to next patient and not focus on me 100%  or learn all there is about my situation
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician. She seems to know her stuff and has a good bedside manner. She is always there to answer any questions or concerns that I may have.  
0.640000	The doctor's experience, Your level of education, Your work experience, Their industrial-level status
1.000000	because he has not steered me wrong and has treated for years. Furthermore, he has sent to me to several specialist who were both professional and excellent doctors as well. He carefully explains any medication changes that he makes and why he is making them, and he listens to me.
0.800000	its hard to trust sometimes. sometimes they are just there for the money, and some really do care about you
0.920000	He explains things well. I never feel rushed during a visit. He takes time to answer all my questions.
1.000000	Because honesty trusworthy, down to earth easy to speak to and explains in a eay to understand. Easy to lean from
0.800000	My doctor has never given me false or misleading information. He's always been straight forward with me, even when he knows there are things I should change but probably won't. 
0.400000	They don't have the same helpful enthusiasm when you don't have insurance. They rush through the visit, take their time getting to you, and assume you just want drugs. 
0.880000	When I was 41 yr. old I had a severe asthma episode.  I had never had asthma before and I almost died.  The Dr. the ER called in saved my life then and I had him as my doctor for many years and had me on meds that controlled the asthma.  More recently I have had other doctors and have been treated well; have had questions answered; been given meds that did what they were supposed to do.
0.600000	My doctor just hurries through the appointment and does not really listen to me especially about woman problems and he just does not understand or know how to fix them.
0.800000	I have seen the same Dr. for 17 years so she knows me well. She's open to my suggestions involving my care and will usually agree. She orders appropriate tests and mess and is available to receive and promptly answer emails.
0.600000	My doctor is friendly and sincere, but more and more she seems a bit hurried in getting me in and out. I still generally trust her, but would appreciate more time or discussion
0.600000	Doctors are only as knowledgeable as they are taught and what is told to them by the pharmacy industry. 
0.640000	I someti,es feel that my best interests are not met. I feel like the dr is doing things that require me to have to spend more versus dealing with the issue at hand.
0.720000	My primary care physician is very intelligent and knowledgeable.  However their are conditions that he does not know the details of and when questioned he dismisses concern.  He is not likely to discuss emotional reactions to anything.  That is fine with me but he has patients that are upset about that aspect.  He is very clinical.  He trusts lab tests for most everything.  I trust him but wish her was a little more curious about symptoms.  It is possibly an age thing as he is ready to retire.
0.880000	I have been with my primary care physician for almost 20 years.  He discusses everything with me and utilizes my input into treatment plans.
0.800000	i think my primary care physician is very skilled and is straight-forward.  he is also compassionate (and funny)
0.680000	I feel like my doctor is quick to prescribe something for my condition without fully testing me or suggesting natural methods or cures. 
0.760000	For the most part, I feel that they are most knowlegeable about medicine. I have no reason not to trust their judgement for most health information.
1.000000	I have had a bad experience with another doctor.  She is very through and concerned.  She listens and takes her time.

0.680000	I trust that my doctor tries to do well by me.  However, I think sometimes she is in too big a hurry or is distracted.  I can not trust her completely because she is only human and can make mistakes.  I have to take responsibility for my own health.
0.800000	I trust him completely.  He has never given me reason not to trust him.  He takes as much time as needed with me when I visit.

0.760000	My primary care physician is a local p/a but is not afraid to refer me to specialists in larger cities as necessary
0.520000	In the 1950's a medical career was a vocation of helping others despite the fact that it paid much more in respect than money. By the late 1960's medical school had become a hard, but sure way to wealth. Too many are focused on the payoff today. 
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he listens and is open to what I have to say or suggest. He also is very good at explaining things and various options available for whatever I may need. (for example: medication options)

0.920000	Good communication is a must with your doctor. Mine is a very relaxed and sincere man.  He gives me his attention and takes his time to make sure everything is clear and that I have no questions.  He explains everything fully and has a game plan for how to proceed forward, and I love that about him.
0.760000	I do not have a long relationship with my doctor but am confident that they are skilled and motivated to address my issues.

0.200000	I think most doctors are in it just for the money I take their advice with a grain of salt and research stuff on my own...I have been given wrong advice often and wrong diagnosis more then once
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I have not found anything to distrust them about. I understand what he tells me and it always seems to fit with what diagnosis he has for me. I make sure to look up things and learn about them and nothing has ever raised my suspicions that my doctor is wrong or way of base.
1.000000	I have been with him for a long time. He listens to what  I have to say and works hard to make sure that he gives me good care and treatment and gets me feeling better. If there is something he feels he can not help me with he will find someone who can treat me better
0.840000	I trust her, but so far she's been fine. I was diagnosed with Diabetes 5 years ago, and then my doctor retired and I started with this doctor. I lost 55 pounds on my own and she took me lots of my meds including Alendronate because I was on it for 10 years. My osteoporosis didn't get better, but stayed the same then I hurt my back and they found two fractures, so she put me back on it. She also doesn't check for A1C because no diabetes anymore. So I trust her, but really doesn't check a lot of things.
0.800000	My dr is caring and competent. She listens to me and always is able to pinpoint and fix my problem. I trust her opinion and feel confident she has my best interest at heart

0.800000	I sometimes research my doctor's suggestion.  It seems like when I do, I ask him more questions.  I do not disagree with him very much.
0.600000	I strongly consider their opionions but dont necessarily trust them. Some doctors force their bias on patients amd are sometimes inpatient and rude. 
0.800000	I've known him since I was a kid. He's been my family and personal doctor for over 30 years and I trust him. He's helped me through quite a few issues and struggles.
0.920000	My doctor has never steered  me  wrong or had me  do anything  without listening to my concerns . He  explains things to me in simple language.
0.600000	I do not trust doctors at all it seems there thing is to give a pill for a pill and this side effect will outweigh this side effect
1.000000	Because he was my student in high school; I know him well; we have a strong bond and I know that he would not tell me to do anything that he wouldn't tell his own parents.
0.720000	he tells me everything needed for each visit why and the whats in very detailed and common English which is very easy to under stand
0.720000	My primary care doctor has a good bedside manner,she's very thorough when she explains everything to me.She tells me what she thinks I need or don't need for my care.
0.400000	My doctor only sees me as an obese ugly woman and only wants to get to the next patient.  Doesn't see me as a person but only $$$ signs
0.600000	Seeing so many people, it is hard to have a relationship with a doctor that would be anything more than a routine visit.
1.000000	My physician has always been very open about what she thinks I should do about any condition that I am curious about at the time.  She has always been very thorough in her explanation of things and questions me as to whether I have any questions at all.
0.800000	My doctor  is a do.She is there first do primary care doctor I have had. She is  more holistic in her approach to patient care. I like that.
0.440000	I have had doctor's only tell me information that would make them the most money, or be lazy and not give me all the information, especially if was not convenient for them.  It's hard to ever know for sure if a doctor is telling you everything or not.
0.760000	The doctors I see now are always open and up front with me about the treatment I am receiving. Because of this, I trust their judgement in making a diagnosis and the possible treatment(s).
0.720000	I trust my PCP as I have been seeing her more than ten years and she has helped me through a number of illnesses, chronic and other. 
0.720000	This one is hard to answer because my old doctor retired and I now have a new doctor that I've only seen once.  She seems ok, but very different than my previous doctor who was really personable.  She is more professional and not really into have a relationship with her patients.
1.000000	I have know my doctor for a long time. I trust what he does. He looks after my best intrests and takes care of me. 
0.680000	they have always been honest with me and take care of me all i have to do is call them and they will work me in
0.600000	I don't have a regular physician at the moment but when I do I stick with one who I feel is great at their job
0.720000	I trust that my doctor has my best interests at heart. I have often had many questions and my doctor always had time to answer them and give me as many options as I needed to make health decisions.
0.960000	I trust my doctor a lot because she's the one with the degree and not me. She knows what she's doing and I trust her because she hasn't given me a reason not to.
0.760000	I have been going to my family practice for over ten years. I am very comfortable with the doctors, nurses, and aides working there. They take the time needed with me, listen to all my concerns and answer all my questions, and will offer me additional options if need be.

0.600000	It seems to me that most if not all doters are working for pharmsudical companies to try new drugs on unsuspecting patients,which seldom works on individual people rather than the majority
0.880000	I go to my GP with a concern about something, and even if she doesn't think that is what is happening, she will still follow through in checking herself, or else she will give me a referral to a physician that can give me peace.  Every specialist I have from her referrals has been just as interested, and just as careful to handle my concerns as my primary.
0.960000	I've seen the same person for several years and we have developed a rapport with each other. I trust her to tell me the truth.
0.520000	I go in his office and he asks me how I am doing and looks at the lap top to see what is going on and says a few words and then says I will see you in 6 months. I keep him just for my medications.
1.000000	He is the best in his field! He's very caring and has a great bedside manner. He's open and honest with me. He talks through things with me and I can page him when/if I need him. 
0.440000	I don't necessarily trust physician's opinions a hundred percent of the time because they can be wrong like anyone else. One physician is just one person's opinion. 
0.800000	never has given me a reason not to trust him seems open and honest if i ask something takes the time to explain
0.880000	Relates well personally and spends time talking and suggesting best care.  History of experience in their medical speciality.

0.760000	I have many issues because of my Lupus diagnosis. Therefore I listen to my Doctor as well as listen to my body. I believe that my being well informed helps my relationship with my doctor.
0.600000	I do not see a primary care physician. I prefer holistic medicine, ie. natural or herbal medications, essential oils & studying changes in diet to aid in healing the body naturally. Our bodies were created to heal themselves. The use of synthetic medications tend to cause other physical side effects. They focus on the symptoms rather than the root problem causing the symptoms.
0.880000	My doctor takes time and listen to what's going on with me. Takes time and doesn't rush. Takes time to explain
0.560000	I trust my doctor because its his job to know how to treat his patients but i think he could be more thorough and listen more.
1.000000	I have had the same primary care dr for 30 years. His background is much like mine and he is excellent.i trust him implicitly.
0.560000	The Primary Care Physician I have right now I trust very much, but she is leaving her practice and has not informed any patience as of yet. I am afraid of finding a new one Because my previous physican gave me a hard time helping me manage a medical condition

0.800000	I trust my care provider she has been very understanding and very helpful with my needs she has also called my house with different concerns which is unusual for doctors to do nowadays
0.960000	He is extremely careful and asks many questions. He has always been very inquisitive and helped me understand my thyroid problem.
0.760000	I've never been given a reason to distrust a doctor I've seen. I've always been given information and had my questions answered in a reasonable manner. 
0.720000	He pays attention to detail.  He recommends another doctor if a specialist is needed without hesitation.  He is in the loops if I need to go to specialist.  He does not horse,around about giving medicine that will do the job.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he discusses things candidly and in ways I can understand. He always answers any questions and takes my wants into consideration. He is open to exploring any treatments that might benefit me and is honest about side effects and reasons why or why not something may be a good idea.

0.800000	I trust my primary care physicians because they are honest & upfront with me. They don't tell me what I want to hear.
0.800000	No matter what my condition was or is mu primary care physician was able to make a correct diagnosis 100% of the time.
1.000000	My physician takes his time in examining any problems mental or physically. He will provide accurate detailed information to in which once after the visit, you're more aware of your body especially on things that you didn't know.
0.960000	HE LISTENS TO WHAT I TELL HIM ABOUT MY HEALTH AND IF SOMETHING IS NEEDED, HE WILL EXPLAIN IT TO ME. I ALWAYS WILL GET WHAT EVER TESTING  I NEED DOWN WITHOUT A SQUABBLE.
0.880000	My primary care physicians takes the time to talk to me, even discussing things that are going on with my family and work that might be affecting my health. She seems truly concerned about my well-being.
0.800000	My doctor is open and honest with me. He is very thorough in his examinations and he seems to listen to what I'm saying to him. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician based on the relationship that developed.  She discusses the latest information.  She is also an instructor. 
0.600000	Because every Dr I been too has mix diagnosed me,missed broken ribs,an tell u anything an think u are drug seeking. But don't care if you are actually in pain or sick
0.600000	I think she has so many patients so I feel like a number. I also thinl she wants to prescribe certain medications. I assume rhere are kickbacks 
0.600000	I don't distrust them. I place very high trust in them because they have been through years of school so that they can be in a place where they are.
0.920000	My primary care physician spends a lot of time with me.  He has even come in on his day off to see me.  He listens to my opinions, respects them, and is open in discussing issues with me.
0.800000	he is willing to work with me and try other ways instead of adding more medicine that would be more harmful then helpful
0.600000	It is not that I distrust my primary care doctor but that I am fully aware they are human and humans make mistakes and or tend to miss things that aren't obvious so I am a strong advocate in believing in my gut and getting a second opinion if I have any doubts 
0.520000	Doctors make extra money by referring to other doctors and by prescribing certain medicines. That is counter to my best interests. I take what the doctor recommends with a grain of salt.
0.840000	I basically trust doctors because they have more knowledge than I do. I do not completely trust anyone.  If my doctor says or suggests something I do not agree on I will question her. If I ever feel I can't trust my doctor I will find a new doctor
1.000000	My doctors are very aware of my physical circumstances and listen to any objections I have. We agree together as to what is needed. If I have an objection, they willingly listen to me and change things.
0.840000	this is a get one for me.being going for a long time.i like very much.he is the best one for me.that is why i go to him.
0.400000	At the moment, I am in between a primary care physician.  I have been with an internal medicine doctor as my primary care doctor for almost 30 years and for the last two years (I go in once a year for a physical checkup), I feel I wasted my time.  He read my blood work and didn't even ask if I had any questions or problems to address.  I now have an appoint next month to see a new internal medicine doctor.
0.840000	i trust my doctor because she takes her time with me to find out what is best for me. she also gives me advice on what kind of medications that would be good for my condition
0.640000	I am neutral about whether I trust or distrust doctors because there are many factors involved. You sometimes have to see different doctors and the circumstances are different for each one. 
0.880000	I have been with him for over 10 years and we have developed a trust. If I had to find a new doctor, I would have a hard time finding one that I have the same kinds of relationship with.
0.800000	In addition to a primary care physician, I also have many specialists and sub-specialists.  I find my primary-care physician works well with these other doctors to ensure positive outcomes.
0.560000	I trust the PA more then my primary doctor, she is more willing to find out what is wrong with me. Some primary doctors are only in it for the money and are not willing to diagnose and find out what is wrong with their patients. If a test doesn't show what is wrong then it ends there
0.680000	i trust him because he's a physicaian in the professional and medical field,he,s never steered me in the wrong direction that i can prove if anything to prove he is a kindhearted peson and really cares about his patients
0.480000	feel that she is rushed and doesn't have the time to address my concerns. i'd like to try a different type of a medication and also manage my chronic conditions better
0.640000	My doctor has a lot of patients so she has to see them all she might miss something I need medically 
0.320000	i have little trust in doctors.I have had to fire them because of their care less and evil verbal abuse.When give detailed testing procedures I had to refuse the action as it was a sure failure and would spread the current infection.I was offered perscriptions that were incorrect.I knew what would work but the doctor did not know for one month.Had I not been able to deal with the infection I would lost a life.
0.520000	"Medicine is now practiced by rote. The ""average"" person will accept the off-the-cuff surface diagnosis.  I'm not one of those people. As my mother pointed out years ago, presidents, kings, and doctors, all put their pants on one leg at a time. I only accept the ""Gospel truth"" from the Gospel."
0.800000	I have been with them for years and they have a great practice and have never made me second guess anything that they have done. I actually need to go back.
0.680000	He does take the time to pay attention to me and answer my questions.  He is about ready to retire and I am saddened about that.  These EHR mandates are a source of trouble for him
0.640000	I feel that they are in a hurry sometimes, and i get the feeling it is about the money, and  they are too quick to perscribe pills instead of trying other treatments first
0.640000	I trust them, She isVery in tune with me. She listens to me, she takes her time.  She doesn't rush you through and not listen
0.800000	I have no reason not to trust my physicians. They have always given me information that is thorough and thoughtful.
0.600000	I've known him a long time and he usually answers all of my questions honestly and truthfully. He is always available when I need him.
0.800000	We have a great dialogue with  each other. He seems to actually listen to me, unlike other doctors in my past.
0.520000	I don't completely trust my doctor because I don't feel like I can trust any doctor after previous experiences with bad doctors. However, I feel like my doctor genuinely wants to help me and cares about what happens to me, I just don't think they always tell me what my best option of treatment is all the time, etc.
0.600000	To be honest, I haven't been to a primary care physician in many many year.  If I did go see one, I would have a great deal of trust. 
0.600000	My primary care doctor has changed 3 times in the last year.  I totally trust my gynecologist and cardiologist.  Sometimes doctors want to charge insurance companies for additional testing.  Sometimes they don't want to tell you that you should maybe see a different specialist.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he has been around for many years and has the experience in treating pretty much everything. 
0.680000	I trust my doctor for the most part. I feel that he will do right by me but sometimes I feel I am being rushed. I can not think of anything else to say.
0.960000	I trust her implicitly. She is thorough, asks questions, actually listens to my answers and answers my questions. She is friendly,  seems really interested in me.
0.720000	I trust my doctors because they have been there for me and have helped me find medical conditions that I didn't know existed and without them something bad could have happened.
0.600000	I trust them because I have been going there for a long time and like all of them and know they would do anything for me and my health.
0.480000	It just seems doctors are to eager to get to the next patient. They never spend enough time with you.
0.760000	Sometimes I feel my clinical doctors are overwhelmed with too many patients and just skim the chart of the patient before him. His skimming the page can hardly relay too much confidence on said patient. 
0.760000	I have known my doctor for years, he takes care of my family and know and trust him to make careful and thoughtful decisions concerning my health.
0.600000	I've known too many doctors to do things in a rush. I wish they would of sat and had  a conversation with me, instead of telling me what needed to be done, cause some things aren't actually necessary. 
0.640000	That is hard to answer with any amount of certainty as my primary doctor has just retired and I have only had one contact with my new doctor.  That appointment went satisfactory -  but don't know the whole picture.
0.680000	I trust doctors because they have medical experience and know more than I do That is why I go to them when I am sick or have a medical problem
0.600000	Often times its feels as if the primary care physicians, allergists, and other doctors will sometimes make things worse than what they really are at the time. Sometimes it is like they want the patient to spend more money out of pocket and constantly come back for nothing.
0.600000	I have not found a primary care doctor that i actually like. They are always quick to give medications or rush you out of the office. 
0.600000	He is a family friend but I personally do not like his bedside manner. He is a good doctors but he can be cold and brusque, which I do not like
0.800000	he has been on top of my care and takes the time needed to understand the symptoms and challenges that my condition entails.  Seems up on current practices and thinking inthe medical world.
0.760000	I feel that my doctor is completely up front and honest in all aspects that I deal with him. he has a very good reputation.
0.720000	I think that the majority of doctors enter the field because they have some desire to help others. I trust my doctor, who has undergone years of schooling and is an expert, to guide me on the correct path to health. 
0.800000	I went through several doctors before I found my doctor.  He is always ready to listen, doesn't prejudge and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure that I understand what he tells me
0.800000	i trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them for many years and they have always been very caring and helpful no matter the situation. i also trust them because i think they want to have a good reputation so they do their best with me as a patient.
0.560000	I trust because they talk to me and explain all my option and care about my needs always there in an emergency
0.720000	Because my doctor asks what medications I need. He knows I do my research. My doctor knows that I am a therapist.
1.000000	I feel my doctors look out for my best interest.  They listen to me, answer my questions and make me feel confident I am doing the right thing.  I have been fortunate in my selection of physicians
0.720000	Doctors like my primary care physician are mostly thinking about the pharmaceutical companies and the bonuses they get while masking the problems and side effects as care to their patients.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because my mother used the same one. Also, my physician is caring, kind and considerate to me when I visit. 
0.920000	i have a long term relationship with my doctor and can talk frankly with him. we un derstand each other and he knows my history very well
0.760000	I trust most doctors. My office is full of residents, with full fledged doctors overseeing them.  They are usually thorough, however, a few have been known to rush me & do what they want & not listen to me.
0.600000	I trust them but plan to do further research regarding conditions I visit the doctor for before completely trusting treatment options
0.960000	I trust my Dr because he is very experienced and he knows what he is talking about. I am confident that he has my best interest at heart.
0.680000	I think he has my best interests at heart, although he appears to be overworked with the number of patients he sees (Veterans Admin).
0.760000	I don't have any reason not to trust them. I haven't had any issues come up because I've trusted and taken their advice in the past. I don't think they would tell me false information.
1.000000	He has been there every step of the way. He make me feel comfortable about dealing with my illness. 
0.840000	Doctors are humans, and make mistakes.   Patients are individuals, and not a one fit works for all of us.   What may work perfectly for others, may be an awful thing for me.   
0.640000	I do not put my full trust in doctors because most do not care for your health unless they are getting paid.  If you have no insurance they set you aside than rather to assist you.
0.640000	I have moved to colo. So I have not found a primary doctor yet. The doctor I had in Michigan I completely trusted. They helped me control my asthma. 
0.560000	Doctors are human and as such are not above making mistakes and missing things that should have been observed and so we have to remember this and question things along the way.
0.800000	I'm neutral about some docters and physicians. They can tell you what they think is goo for you but then things can turn out to be bad for you. For instant my wife had high blood pressure. Her blood pressure is always high and she is on medication. They have switched her medicine about 4 times saying that the next one will help, which neither one has helped.

0.760000	My doctor explains all my options for my treatment and gives me a sense of security when I have questions and concerns about my health.

0.920000	The primary don't make the decision alone. It's a few other Dr's and they all agree on what is best for me

0.840000	i trust them to do whats right for me and to give me good advice.  its their job to take care of me and  trust them to do so
0.760000	I feel that doctors do their job to the best of their ability but at the end of the day ethnic race and money is their main concern. If you have a condition that could be highly expensive and you have Medicaid like me then I doubt that they will tell you anything until it's too late.
0.640000	They are just doing their job and are human some times. They can forget certain things either due to stress or distraction from other cases or patients 
0.800000	She takes the time to listen to my concerns and ideas and plan for my health, as well as providing valuable information to assist me in doing so.

0.720000	They too are not perfect and sometimes have a chance of not getting it right. But for the most part i trust their judgement
0.480000	I feel like I can't trust my primary care physicians completely because sometimes I feel like they do what is more convenient for them and don't put my needs as a patient first which is what I believe should happen, they don't tell all the side effects to a medication and some may not even know all the side effects. It's best in my opinion to go out and do my own research before trying anything just because I feel like most doctors really at the end of the day care about making money more than their patients health
0.800000	I trust my doctor because when he is with me he is force on me, he listen to what I am saying and take action about what I am saying. 
0.760000	I know next to nothing in the medical field and I see no reason why my doctor would not be interested in me regaining my full health. Hence, I see not reason not to trust them. My trust is not complete because they are still humans and can still make mistakes.
0.600000	Presently, I don't have health insurance  but it depends on my health needs. Or if, success has been accomplished after first visit. It depends what type doctor, too. I have issues & experienced certain problems related to my health for being neutral. Those experiences effect how I think, & causes some doubt about whether I am getting proper care. I know, I am responsible for my well-being, my understanding about why my body malfunction but need the assistance of others when in need. If, a medication is producing ill effects or too much is given. When, I am in control, I stop immediately & I don't take. Once the wrong thing has been administered it maybe to late. We all have our needs, & we may have same things. But body function differently when taken, the understanding.
0.760000	I trust my physician because he takes time  to explain to me what is going on with my body and what treatments are available to me concerning  my well being.
0.520000	I do not trust one of my physicians because even though I feel pain I always get the feeling that because they know nothing is broken I shouldn't be in pain or as much pain as I say I am. Also they give presriptions that either don't last long or just not work at all. I Do trust them because I am referred to them by my parent and some of my other physician are much more different. 
0.760000	i trust my doctor with the upmost respect as long as i provide him with details on what is going on with my body and he/she can elaborate on my health
0.800000	I have been you g to get for over ten years .  Through my experience and good outcome from her treatments, recommendations, and care know she is knowledgeable in her practice.
0.840000	Whenever I have my yearly check up with my doctor I have trust in the outcome.  But if I were diagnosed with something I was not sure about I would get a second opinion.  I have a pretty good trust in doctors because before I go to a doctor I research him/her first so I know I have the best pretty much.
0.960000	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because he takes the time to listen to my questions and the information that I share regarding how I am feeling.  He is very concerned and elicits my input when attempting to understand my health concers.
0.600000	My primary physician, sometimes I trust and distrust her at times. I don't really get what I need from her educationally when I'm there. 
0.520000	I don't trust a lot of doctors. Not all doctors in medical field are there for patient health, just money for lining their pockets. Not for well being of patients.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because she's confident and sure in what she's saying no feeling as if she lost or don't know what to do 
0.280000	I do not trust my doctore since when I talk with him alone he is rude and makes me feel bad for my depression. Although when I am with my parents he tries to be respectful and acts very different. I have never felt comfortable around him.
0.800000	I don't have a primary doctor right now but all the doctors I be been too turned out good whatever they recommended worked 
0.720000	The reason why I trust the doctor is because they care about people health also the be knowing what they be talking about most of the time
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician went I have good results from my recent check-ups and I distrust my primary care physician when I have the opposite.
0.680000	I haven't been with my primary care physician for a long time so I can't say I completely trust them. 
0.800000	I trust him because I understand everything that he explain all procedures  thoroughly    Always available 
0.720000	 I have been going to the same care physician since I was a little kid. I just most recently stopped going to them because I am now too old. So I always trusted his judgment because I have pretty much known him my whole life.  I also trust my new doctor because he is a doctor and that is his job 
0.680000	I don't trust them because They only prescribe medication as treatment and only see you briefly. I trust them because they know more than me and they are supposed to be concerned about my health 
0.520000	I feel like all doctors are there first for the income and second for the health of the people. It's kind of hard to tell whether or not a doctor really cares about your well being or they just tell you anything to get you out of the way.
0.600000	I have trust to a certain extent, in doctors generally...never been misdiagnosed or anything. I have sought out second opinions. Most doctors encouraged you do do so, if they are trustworthy.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician or regard to doctors in general because they are doctors and suppose to be trusted they hold information that is very private and personal to us and have to be trusted because of such. She's also kind. 
0.720000	I generally trust doctors to offer their best insights based on their knowledge and experience, which far surpasses mine as it relates to general health concerns. So I am open-minded enough to entertain any advice they offer. However, I'm also assertive enough to make my own thoughts and questions known so that together, hopefully, we determine the best plan for my personal health. 
1.000000	Over time everything thing that my doctor suggest that I do benefits me and I never had a bad experience with any medication that she precribed for me.
0.680000	I am not in trust with doctors cause they're always changing doctors everyday is not getting close to any doctor if themes a new one the next time u go.
0.760000	It's easy to communicate with my doctor and he talks to me using words I would understand and if neededâ I would be able to to tell it to someone else
0.800000	I have had the same doctor since i was little. My kids go to the same doctor. I trust the Urgent care centers in case of emergency
0.480000	I trust my doctor because I can talk to her about anything I may be going through at the moment. I am always open and honest with her 
0.760000	Has a personal caring disposition with me at That is very important to me and my health has a knowledge of getting me to where I am health wise 
0.600000	They've invested a lot of time and money to stand where they're standing. why wasted that time if you cant be trusted because in the long run your going to get exposed.
0.640000	I do have a primary care doctor, and generally I trust his advice but sometimes doubt that he is giving me all the information I need about certain situations.
0.440000	in 1998 a Dr said I had breast cancer.  He cut my breast off and took out 11 lymphnodes   He got the records mixed up and gave me surgery for someone with stage 4 cancer.  I now have immune system problems and lymphodemia.  He gave me 5 years to live.  Before this the Dr was always right.  I approach Dr's like I do Medicine, with caution.  Only if I really, really need it.  
0.760000	With all the schooling and expenses doctors have to pay in medical school I would hope they enjoy what they are doing. I trust my doctor because that is their profession and I feel comfortable with their decisions 
0.600000	I mostly trust my PCP. The only bad thing is I feel rushed. Which also makes me feel like she doesn't care. But she does try to find me help through other doctors or whatever is wrong with me. She does ask me questions that I don't even think to ask her. She seems to want to cure me quickly .
0.400000	I think that with any doctor I will have some distrust from their patients, because its a money making business. I think that how much income a doctor generates definitely has an impact on the amount care that the doctor provides. I personally often have these distrusting feelings but I also have no problem asking questions for clarification.  I will object to something that I disagree with and I will go else where for treatment.
0.600000	I have to that's who I go to and chose if I feel that the trust is not there then I will should change I don't fully put my trust in just a doctor them selves I have to trust me as well
0.920000	he has been there for me and he alway s tells you the truth and does not sugarcode any thing.you can reach him anyrime
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because he is well trained and experience in his field of study or profession 
0.640000	Sometimes the information is bleak and not easily understood. sometimes i feel like i dont get the treatment or answers that i need.
0.760000	I believe a doctor can treat me of my illness when am able to tell them what my problems are and also when they are able to diagnose my sickness 
0.600000	I an neutral to most doctors because they are in it for the money. The more medications they proscribed the more money in their pockets 
0.840000	My doctor always lets me know about my tests and if she feels I need  another test to make sure that I am doing well, she will not hesitate to get me the best care.
0.880000	My doctor seems very trustworthy and every time I go to her she gives me great advice and seems as if she cares. I go mainly for womanly checks and she does a great job making sure I'm comfortable.
0.680000	I trust my doctor him to a certain extent because they have the knowledge and understanding what's going on. It's always best to get a second opinion because you don't know exactly what's right and wrong.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because when ever I had concerns about the medication i was taking they've always listened to me and made changes in the medication that was effective and had less side effects.
1.000000	I went through a few doctors before my current doctor. So I have a lot of confidence in both my doctors, I have to see a neurologist and my primary doctor.  The first neurologist actually admitted to me that she didn't know much about my condition so therefore I had no confidence in her at all.
0.680000	I trust my doctor to an extend, but I think it's always important to do research on conditions for yourself and God third party medical opinions as well.
0.600000	I kinda both distrust and trust. But the reason why i distrust is because i feel like they dont want to actually look into the problem. its like they have to diagnois you with something even its wrong. and then on to the next person. its like they have so many people that they dont really care about whats happening with you. 
0.680000	None and I'm dong okay and I have nothing to say as for right now and I really don't have no answer for this question that you are asking me 
0.600000	some dont have your best interest in mind. they just wanna give you drugs drugs and more drugs. i dont wanna be a sale. they need to do better to help these people

0.600000	I trust my doctor because he so far has given me the best care.Plus I have been with the same doctor for years
0.600000	Some doctors do care about their patient's welfare, however other doctors just see dollar signs on the patient's forehead and are just working for money to go on vacations. 
0.720000	They are honest and helpful. In a human level they give you tips on what is right for you.i feel they break down the good and the bad of your health situation in a way that makes you think. Other times they try to hard or not enough to be on your side. You can tell if you trust or distrust by personality.
0.880000	Because she is up front and honest and she is not going to beat around the bush about my health she tells it like it is rather i won't to hear it or not 
0.640000	My doctor is rather trustworthy. He makes sure everything I came in about is checked and will answer questions and run relevant tests if he sees necessary
0.680000	I don't fully trust one of my primary care doctors  because my bills are always really high. It's like she just orders every test she can possibly find even though it's not necessarily needed. If you tell her you don't do well with certain meds she'll say that she thinks they're better than the kind you do well with.
0.720000	My doctor is a no nonsense person. She tell it to you like it is and do not hesitate to explain why your ailment is what it is
0.200000	Because I've had many surgeries that I didnt have to have. Which has caused me a lifetime of pain. There was other options I found was available after surgeries 
0.800000	i trust my doctor becaus eInhave been seeing him for a while now and he genuinely seems as thought he cares about me.

0.640000	I trust my doctor because they went to school and they are the experts. They know biologically what's going on more than I do and can give a name and diagnosis to my guy feeling

0.760000	My doctor wants the best for his patients. He tries to look into matters before he give you an answer. He checks. Things out,he do serveral tests before saying what the problem really is.

0.760000	It is the first ethical responsibility of health care givers to provide or refer patients to others in order for them to receive the best treatment possible . It is also their responsibility to give the most up to date care to patients 
0.640000	"He is knowledgeable, yet I'm unsure if he understands my discomfort. I hope for more of him when I see him. Yet I hear a lot of ""that's normal for you"" when I want him to do something about my symptoms "
0.680000	A doctor is a person, and I like to have the final say in anything that concerns my health or lifestyle.
0.440000	I trust doctors being they e had more schooling in medical than the average person but sometimes it's hard to trust them because they check you over and diagnose problems so quickly or sometimes they have to look up your symptoms or ask a colleague for advice to determine a diagnosis.

0.840000	I have been going to him long enough to know I can trust him. When he was having me go to the hospital by the time I got there my room was already assigned to me.
0.480000	"My doctor has made huge mistakes on forms like making me get shots for school he thought were required when the form actually said I was excluded. He also signed below the signature line which was odd. He says contradicting things like ""inside your ears it looks PERFECT"" than says I""m suffering from inner ear inflammation. "
0.600000	I can't really say that I trust or distrust my doctor. Sometimes I feel like she's doing everything she should and giving me all the information I need but other times it feels like she doesn't hear all the information I give her to give an accurate diagnosis or information I need.

0.520000	The reason I cant trust my primary physician on a regular day to day daily basis is because to me it seems a lot of them are simply in it for the check. I also feel like my primary physician looks at everything from a book perspective, and the truth is no matter what schooling no book can tell you everything about real life, especially when dealing with a real life person. I feel a lot of providers just see us as a number or a insurance claim, they aren't understanding enough to realize that some things are just life not everything can be explained via a book. 
0.800000	My PCP gives me plenty of time so that I can ask and get answers to questions. She listens attentively, takes notes, and reviews old notes, so I know she is attuned to my case at hand.

1.000000	I trust my doctor because I am able to question him about any procedure, or medications and get an answer and information.  I am given options and information to make appropriate decisions.  So with that it's a given to always be truthful about what I tell him about my care, side affects if any.
0.800000	My doctor wants me to be well so he is going to do his best to give me the medication and/or advice that will work the best for me.

0.760000	I trust my doctor because I believe that he is making the right decision and what it's best for me. 
0.720000	she's great for minor stuff and also quick diagnosis of some more serious conditions but not about alternative medicine options.  she explains things thoroughly and in a way I can easily grasp
0.800000	My doctor is kind and thoughtful.  When I go for a check up, we review what transpired at the last physical.  She gives me a complete check up and we discuss meds.

0.800000	Dr Hassan is very honest with me, he tells me straight up what I need to do. My OBGYN has saved my life 2 times on the operation table. I love her much!
0.560000	I have a new doctor, this is my first primary physician outside of my pediatrician. I believe it will take time to fully understand and trust each other.
0.520000	I think my doctor can be in a hurry and not always listen to what I am saying. She likes to push me off to specialist when I don't always feel I need to see one.
0.640000	I don't trust my primary care phyaician, for the simple fact that I am just know know (by them), that I shouldn't be taking Celexa and Reglan together because it makes me even more in a bad mood.
0.880000	I trust my doctors because they have always been correct on the medication and treatment they have prescribed for me. They take their time and listen to what I have to say.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because they explain everything I need to know and even give me options if I dnt agree with something they are telling me. He doesn't rush my visit and he listens to all the problems and concerns I have.
0.760000	My primary care physician is a nice woman who listens to me. She will direct me to many specialists.  She, however, does not treat very often.  She goes over the records of other doctors, etc.  
0.800000	I trust them all no matter what the situation, sometimes I do get other opinion on something just to make sure.
0.520000	Although I'm quite satisfied with my doctor and really like her as a person, she's made a few mistakes that cost me a lot of physical pain and could have been very bad for me if not fatal. 
0.520000	He doesn't take time to listen to what is I am saying. He comes into the room, checks your breathing, look into your ears (only if asked) and then proceeds to write prescriptions 
0.640000	I don't think doctors know what they think they know. I have multiple disabilities, and at least one is an orphan - no known good treatments.  The ones for the standard form don't work well if at all.  And the ones they won't give me are the only things that ever did any good!
0.560000	It seems like they're always in a hurry to just prescribe me anything and get me out of there. They also don't really do thorough checks to figure out what is really wrong with me when I'm really sick. They just send me on my way to fast.
0.800000	I have developed a good relationship with my doctor over the years and she has always treated me well.
0.560000	i feel like they see so many patients they dont have enough time to individualize care. They will just write you a prescription and send you on your way
1.000000	I trust my doctor implicitly, because I have been going to him for many years, and he always has my best interests at heart.
0.640000	Just switched to a new doctor and do not know her well enough to trust or distrust her. I need to get to know her better to make a call on this.
0.760000	i have been seeing my doctor of over thirty years and he has never led me to anything that would hurt or harm me
0.760000	being 71 i always look forward to seeing the doctor asking questions and making sure i understand the answers
1.000000	We have been seeing the same doctor for past 17 years, & have complete confidence in his treatment of all of our problems that may crop up. Our doctor has our complete faith that he will correctly tell us what is wrong, and order the proper test/medicine we will need to correct it. 
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because of his professionalism. However, if I'm not satisfied I can ask the second opinion.
0.880000	I have used this doctor for many years and he has always guided me correctly and medical directions I need.
0.720000	I see more specialists than I see my primary. The specialists are very conservative in treatment planning and sometimes I have to present my own research to get treatment moving along
0.600000	Well it depends. Some doctors only group their patients in a certain category. They do not praise when the patient does well and cannot recognize the patients who are compliant 
0.840000	It depends on the individual doctor. I have met some that are terrible, but most are as I rated them above.
0.960000	Someone I and comfortable with and trust their medical judgement. They listen to my concerns and address them and does not blow me off.
0.520000	if you dont have insurance you get very lil consideration because the doctors think that you are not important enough for them to bother with you 
0.200000	I believe all people only care about themselves and would take care of number 1 before anybody. In general people can not be trusted.
0.560000	"My primary care doctor's response to my medical problems is usually ""Well, You're getting older"".  Not helpful"
0.560000	I have a new doctor so my trust hasn't been earned yet.  I did trust my old doctor completely.  My old doctor did all of the things that are listed above.  The new doctor seems to be following some kind of generic schedule instead of finding out what I personally need.
0.800000	I trust my doctor based on his personality and how he talks to me.  If I didn't like him or didn't trust him I would, and have, changed doctors.  
1.000000	He answers my questions, he listens to my health concerns and then tells me what hes going to do for me
1.000000	he has always been correct with diagnosis, takes all the time I need when I see him, does testing when its needed , calls when any test results come back from the lab
0.760000	My primary doctor is a smart, honest and caring person , I trust him taking care of me in my time of need, he explains everything in detail and breaks it down so you can understand what you need to know and then he asks if you have any questions and if you do he will kindly answer them and tell you what you need to know 
0.840000	i don't know yet. Not so sure what to do but, I'll keep trying the best I can. Maybe things will get better sooner or later.
1.000000	He gives an exam which is thorough, goes over all the results, suggests things, allows me to express my opinion and does not make me feel inadequate when I express myself by the way, check your spelling be4 fwding ques.  it is extrOvert not extrAvert

0.520000	I don't know my doctor well enough to give any specifics.  Since I'm pretty healthy we haven't needed to have a relationship other than wellness checkups and a few tests.
0.600000	I generally do not completely trust doctors.  I had one that was totally honest and they could not fix the problem. Another could have fixed something and did not.  A lot of times it's medication. not doctors I don't trust.  My mother died from the nthe side effects of a med she was on.
0.800000	seems to have adequate knowledge and does necessary tests yo diagnose problems. Seems interested in my problems.
