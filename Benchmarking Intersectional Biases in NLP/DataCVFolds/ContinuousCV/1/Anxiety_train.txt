0.547600	Waiting for the doctor and fear of judgement.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried, because I'm not a worrier.  Maybe about how much it will cost....
0.476200	I usually go to the doctor only when I have a health issue. Sometimes I get worried that I might have a serious condition or am getting worse

0.452400	There always rush of people
0.166700	Bad results 
0.357100	I'm anxious and worried all day, regardless of where I am. Going to the doctor just adds a veneer of annoyance.
0.547600	I just am anxious that something bad will pop up. I think things go ignored and could later turn out to be bigger issues the longer they go unlooked at. 
0.619000	Mostly relatively minor phobias about things like needles.
0.500000	I feel anxious about telling the doctor what is wrong.  I'm afraid he won't take my symptoms seriously.

0.381000	I always get anxious when going for something that is hurting, or my anxiety because I think that they all think I just want pills or something like that. So, instead I deal with a lot of pain and anxiety, because of the anxiety it causes me to ask about it. Its a horrible anxious loop.
0.381000	Just the uncertainty if I have a major illness that is going to kill me
0.595200	I'm afraid that they will try to force me to get a procedure that I don't want.

0.214300	In general I think it is just something that everyone feels when they go to a doctors office.  You are just fearful of what they will say it is just the general fear of the unknown
0.571400	My medical condition, if I think it is serious
0.523800	I'm mostly worried if I have no idea what the problem might already be. I usually have an idea of what the issue is before I go and the uncertainty, when I have it, is difficult.

0.142900	Finding something wrong
0.238100	Having to wait a long time for service. 
0.547600	The waiting times which happen and you are in a check up room alone. 
0.285700	Their incompetence. I take care of a (non-family) disabled adult. Many doctors appointments are just terrible for them, because the doctors seem incompetent and inept. So that person doesn't want to see the doctors because they know it will be stressful.

0.666700	They aren't careful. They're in a hurry.
0.785700	When I'm there, I'm worried if he's had a bad day. I feel like that could affect his examition and/or dealings with me.

0.500000	Mostly, I am an anxious person in general. Plus, I'm always a bit worried that something will show up that is wrong with me. Doctors offices in general make me a bit anxious.

0.714300	I fear the end result or diagnosis.
0.500000	I only go when I think something is terribly wrong, so I am worried that I might be right and it's not some simple ailment.
0.238100	Waiting on the dr to arrive in the room and then not knowing what the outcome will be of your symptoms.  Also can get nervous when waiting on him to provide you with test results.  It's an uneasy feeling.

0.761900	I WORRY THATY I CANNOT ACCURATELY EXPLAIN SO SHE WILL UNDERSTAND

0.619000	I don't go unless there's something wrong, so I'm always a little nervous about the outcome.
0.619000	that something will be wrong and it is unexpected.
0.738100	I find it most uneasy the thought that they will find something serious wrong with me, and even worse, what this problem will end up costing me, both emotiolly and fincially.  I worry that any treatments will simply be out of my budget.
0.428600	When I am not sure what to expect or am not quite sure what is wrong with me, then I get a little anxious or concerned.

0.285700	I become anxious about blood draws and injections.
0.452400	I just am always curious what is going on with my body and I am hopeful that it isn't too serious. I don't know what they are planning once I get into the exam room. So, this sense of unease leads to some anxiety.

0.476200	just that they will find something i dont know about or wont truly listen to me
0.357100	The only thing would be the uncertainty. Not knowing what my problem is. 
0.142900	I'm never really anxious when I go to the doctor. The only thing that would make me anxious is if I was experiencing horrible pain but didn't know where it came from 
0.428600	Probably just that I am worried that there's something wrong or that it's worse than I imagined. 
0.142900	Blood work or additiol studies that might be needed and take a few hours for results. 
0.595200	It's most worrisome when you don't know what the results are going to be. It could be bad or it could be good, you don't really know what you're going to hear. Most of the times it ends up being good so worrying is probably unnecessary.
0.166700	I am not really anxious about seeing a doctor because I feel it is better to take care of any problems right away rather than waiting for them to get worse.
0.642900	I just hate the whole experience. I think it's the attitude of the doctors. They seem like they are better than you. I get super nervous.
0.904800	I worry about whether I am going to die. I believe if I'd had more money I would have had better care. I do not get to choose my Dr. I have to go where my insurance will be accepted and these Dr.'s are always different. I never see the same one twice. A few years ago everyone had a family Dr. who knew them all their lives. No longer. 
0.404800	Un unknown illness or condition.
0.428600	Potential of the doctor finding health problems.
0.476200	That something might be wrong.
1.000000	I am most scared I am going to get a death sentence. I have really bad health anxiety.
0.642900	They probably aren't qualified to do what they do. They are LARPing.
0.642900	I have a tendency to think the worst. I am a pessimist. I think something much worse is wrong with me than ever is. 
0.142900	What makes me anxious is the anticipation. I don't know if I have something wrong with me or not.
0.809500	Being around people, having to discuss problems. 
0.142900	Nothing generally makes me worried other than the thought that something might be serious wrong with me.
0.547600	getting scared that there will be something wrong
0.500000	That they won't take me seriously. 
0.761900	I feel worried because I'm a very secretive and self-reliant person. Visiting the doctor is all about depending on someone else and letting them examine and judge you. I don't trust them not to reveal my persol information to anyone they see fit, even if I would strongly object.
0.690500	The idea that I might find out something bad about my health. Especially if I've already been worried that something bad is wrong and I've been researching health issues online that might apply to my situation.

0.142900	I would feel anxious if they did testing and looked at the results and said things didn't look good. 
0.142900	Nothing usually. I am generally very comfortable visiting the doctor. 
0.642900	I worry about what is wrong with me. The doctor doesn't make me feel this way, and I am hoping whatever is wrong isn't serious. It's just the whole waiting game I guess.
0.809500	"I don't like most examitions especially the ones that invade much of my ""privacy"" as far as private parts. That always makes me nervous. It's just not a good feeling to have the doctor look at parts that are usually not disclosed unless to an intimate partner."
0.214300	I have had some medical isseus in the past and I always worry it may come up again 
0.142900	I'm not sure if it counts, since it doesn't actually relate to the actual doctor's office, but the drive over there makes me feel the most anxious.  I have panic attacks when I drive and I really hate to drive because of it.  If that doesn't count, I guess the only anxiety I would feel is if my doctor wasn't in that day since they have three different doctors and I only like him.
0.595200	I feel the most anxious about how much money it will cost me when I'm there. If I'm told I have a serious medical affliction, I practically have to accept my death. This is understandably unsettling to cope with, and thus I to an extent don't want to visit a doctor for this reason.
0.761900	I want to live forever, but as I get closer to 40, I've had a few more issues.  I hate that I now have to start getting rectal exams and things like that.  I just don't ever want to get bad news.
0.452400	I do not enjoy having someone exam my genital area. Otherwise, it is par for the course.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. 
0.357100	Not knowing what will happen.  Not always taken good care of myself
0.142900	I DONT LIKE TO HAVE A FINGER STUCK UP MY BUTT
0.666700	The impending case of my pain, or if I may have something I do not know about. 
0.142900	If I felt I had a loss of life sickness I might be nervous, but otherwise I'm never nervous.
0.142900	Lack of compassion and understanding. Also, acknowledging the existance of chronic Lyme disease at some point would be nice. 
0.166700	Being weighed and having my blood pressure taken is usually nerve-wracking. I have struggled with my weight all my life, and the last couple years my blood pressure has not been stable.
0.571400	Having to wait for so long in waiting room. Then having to wait in examition room. My mind wanders and too much free time and quiet is not good when I am at a doctor visit. I don't want to be told anything is wrong with me.
0.571400	It's an unfamiliar environment and people usually go to the doctor's office when there is something wrong with them healthwise or they are afraid something could be wrong. The uncertainty is likely what causes me the most anxiety.
0.714300	That they will cause me more harm than good. 
0.261900	nothing but the bill.
0.666700	I start imaging the awful diagnosis that he could discover, like cancer. 
0.142900	Nothing does, I have no anxiety when visiting a doctor.
0.714300	I'm always worried they're going to find a lump or something that indicates cancer or another scary disease that would change or end my life.
0.142900	I would feel anxious not knowing the outcome of the visit. It would scare me to find out that I have a problem with my health.
0.190500	Pap smears.  It's just an awkward situation, though what actually gets me is it can hurt LIKE HELL.  I'm pretty good with pain, it's necessary so I shrug it off, but it's certainly not something I look forwards to in any way, shape, or form.
0.928600	That they'll find something really wrong.
0.571400	I usually feel anxious because if I am at the doctors office there is something wrong.  Something wrong means it's going to cost a lot of money.  I don't have health insurance because I can't afford it.
0.571400	I'm done writing pal, this is ridiculous for the pay.  
0.285700	Getting test results for things that i'd rather not knows, for which if the results are bad it's totally going to be my fault cause I made bad decisions in  my past.
0.238100	Them finding something bad.  ALso, something that may be uncomfortable physically, like a shot or a procedure.
0.666700	I am worried I will go home still not knowing what is wrong with me.
0.595200	Just that I never know what they are going to say. Also that I may not agree with what they say or they may want me to do things I don't want to do. It's just that unforseen things can happen.
0.857100	possibility of their being something seriously wrong with me; judgement from the doctor.
0.309500	Just the fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether the doctor will find somethng wrong with me, and if he does find something wrong, how serious will the condition be. 
0.690500	That they are going to tell me that I am overweight or shame me for my weight. 
0.357100	I get nervous about the unknown.  So the until I see the doctor I am a bit worried
0.142900	the fear of the unknown
0.452400	Whether my condition is more serious than I expected
0.428600	I worry that something minor will turn out to be something major. I'm not a hypochondriac, and I don't worry about stuff all the time. It's just that health can be complicated sometimes.
0.714300	When I am just waiting for the results from everything.  My mind will keep thinking of the worst outcome until I hear a solid response.
0.666700	I worry that the doctor won't listen to my concerns or do anything to help me, or that he still won't diagnose my chronic health issues yet again.
0.142900	I am not anxious or worried ever when going to the dr. 
0.142900	Nothing
0.357100	I'm turally anxious, so I feel that way about most new/unusual experiences.
0.523800	Usually it's the unfounded fear that the doctor is going to find something this visit that will drastically change my life.
0.142900	I am in good health so I really do not have any concerns when I visit.  The only thing that makes me anxious is when I have to wait for a long time to get called to the back.

0.285700	Just having to deal with answering lots of questions and getting tests, etc.

0.881000	The anticipation of the exam results is the most nerve wracking. There may be something that I wasn't aware about such as cancer. 
0.690500	blood test. I am terrified of needles and the results.
0.500000	Generally I am worried about the bad news I may receive.  I feel that if I get a bad prognosis then I am doomed to an extremely expensive medical bill as my insurance has a relatively high deductible.
0.428600	I don't tend to get anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I think if I had a serious medical condition, the not knowing if I was going to get better or worse would make me the most anxious. I don't get nervous for annual check-ups.

0.714300	Since I'm getting into my late 30's and I used to party a lot when I was younger, I'm always a little worried that it will filly catch up to me.  I worry about it a lot when I'm at the doctor's office.

0.690500	I have a neuro condition and there are a lot of uncertainties around it. So when I have to be seen for it, it can be a long experience full of many questions.

0.190500	Other people, like a waiting room that's too crowded. Or people coughing and sneezing. i don't do well with others usually.
0.666700	The unknown of what is going on with me.

0.785700	I get worried they won't be nice. I worry that they might look down on me. I worry that they might try to make me fearful. I've experienced this with some doctors. I've also had ones that don't listen and act annoyed when I ask simple questions. This is what I worry about.

0.285700	You always hear horror stories about doctors finding serious issues during routine checks. Although the odds are minuscule the thoughts still cross my mind 
0.571400	It is the waiting and wondering if they will take the time or just throw a prescription at me.
0.428600	Visiting the doctor's office, one usually feels apprehensive. The reason for this is that there's always a chance they can find something else wrong than what currently ails an individual.

0.547600	I would worry the most that they would find something life threatening or dangerous that is not outwardly apparent, and can only be found in a checkup.
0.714300	I'm fat. They always tell you that you need to lose weight or die.

0.214300	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor. Maybe if I had a condition I was sure was serious I might feel kind of anxious.
0.690500	Just the fear that something may actually be wrong and I have no control over. It gives me a great deal of stress.
0.261900	The thing that makes me most anxious is just uncertainty.
0.166700	Just finding surprises regarding my health. The next thing would be the cost. Though I have insurance, It's hard to see what it covers or not and what I will end up paying.
0.142900	Only times I get nervous is when I am in the waiting room, surrounded by sick people. I really do wish more offices had a split up area where people going in for check ups or non contagious things could be sat away from those with spreadable sicknesses.
1.000000	I have chair anxiety and I always have, dentists, doctors, anything like that freaks me out and I think it is a lot of my own neurosis but also the fact that doctors have had a very strange demenour with me and always made me feel like they thought I was too unintelligent to understand what they were telling me.
0.547600	that theyre going to come throgh the door with some scary results.

0.571400	If I don't know what may be wrong with me, I'll feel worried.

0.285700	I usually am anxious anytime I am at a doctors office cause I always worry something will be wrong with me.

0.142900	Well, any time I go there I'm a bit more anxious than usual.  Because it's a doctor's office!  Specifically, probably the sense that he may find something wrong with me that I was not aware of.  And something I do not want to know about.
0.619000	 I feel like they won't believe me when I say I am sick, and I'll have to pass some sort of test in order to get a prescription. I worry my copay money will be wasted if they just tell me to go home and wait it out.
0.928600	Being weighed, being judged, not wanting to divulge information that may make me look bad.

0.381000	Whenever I have an issue i'm worried that it is actually bigger than I expected. The hospital setting sort of makes it worse.
0.761900	I always worried they will find something is wrong
0.357100	The most obvious thing in my eyes...that they will find something wrong that I was not aware of.   It is similar to getting your car worked on.  You always worry the mechanic will come out of the shop and say your &lt;auto part here&gt; is also broken. 
0.809500	That the doctor will pressure me into doing things I can't afford, or don't really want.

0.714300	Being given some negative information about my health that I had no awareness of.
0.452400	I always have that lingering fear at my yearly ladies appointment that it will be discovered that I have cancer or something.  I think many women feel that way. 
0.285700	The only thing that makes me anxious is the wait time to see her.
0.357100	The thing that makes me the most anxious would be going in when I know something is truly wrong with me and not having any idea of the outcome - the uncertainty can be very worrisome. 
0.952400	I fear most that they won't find a solution to the problem I'm having. My pains are real and sometimes they act like I'm faking it.

0.428600	Trying to find out why I'm having certain symptoms

0.261900	its mainly when i don't have a clue whats wrong and could be something serious.
0.738100	I just don't really like doctor's offices or hospitals in general. I worry that I will get some bad news though things are usually fine, but I worry a lot in general.
0.881000	I am afraid of being judged.  I am overweight and I haven't been to a PCP in many yrs.  Both of these things will bring judgment on me.
0.166700	If I'm undergoing a procedure that could have bad results, that makes me anxious. Also, if I have to wait a long time.
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor.

0.666700	I feel that anxious that my doctor will find something really wrong with me.  I worry that I will have to go to the hospital or have some procedure done.  It is the fear of having a serious medical condition.
0.761900	"The bill is number one with a bullet.  Then after that I would be most worried about whatever condition I came in for being worse than it appears, or worst case scerio a big ol' shrug of the shoulders from the doctor saying ""I don't know what causes that..."" then endless testing (oh wait that goes back to cost).  Also lost time I have to take off of work because no doctor keeps a schedule that takes into account peoples working schedule."
0.666700	when i have a problem i'm concerned about and they're trying to figure out what it is, and it becomes apparent it could be something bad
0.166700	I would say what worries me the most is that the doctor may find something seriously wrong, like cancer or the like. As I age, I find that I am much more attentive to the possibilities of those types of diseases (cancer, dementia, arthritis, etc).
0.476200	That I may have to have a shot.
0.142900	I am not anxious at the doctor but if I had to pick something i would say just maybe anxious about shots/pain

0.571400	I don't like being examined and you never know what may come up.  There's always a worry that a doctor will find something wrong.  
0.238100	Strange environment, nervous about having to talk about myself and my issues. Having to bring up questions and concerns when they are doing things. 
0.571400	I'm worried I'll have a condition I didn't think about. I'm worried I won't be able to live.
0.904800	I guess, obviously, the thing that makes me most worried is the potential for finding something wrong. The second most worrying thing for me is being in that close proximity (prodded, touched) by someone. I also worry about catching something from all the sick people in the building.
0.833300	I have a general anxiety towards doctors. I feel as though if i go to the doctor i am going to get bad news. No matter what i go for, i feel like they are going to find a termil illness that i did not know i had. 
0.976200	I cried last time I went because I couldn't handle the stress of him treating me like I'm stupid or asking why I'm gaining so much weight. All he could say was I'm referring you to a phys doctor. 
0.571400	Being forced to make a decision in a short amount of time about something that can affect my life long term. I also have to shell out a lot of money for a service that has a high chance of not helping me.
0.571400	If I am at the doctor's office for a routine checkup I usually feel fine. If I am there for a problem, I sometimes worry about what the diagnosis will be, such as what is the exact problem, cause, and how long it will last.

0.857100	I don't like being touched or judged. 
0.333300	turally worrying whether or not all is well. I also think the enviornment of the doctors waiting room and the doctors room can be intimidating. 
0.261900	I do not like needles so having to take a blood sample with usually make me a little worried.
0.714300	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor is going to discover a serious medical condition I did not know I had. I am anxious that this will affect my quality of life going forward. This makes me anxious to some degree about visits.
0.761900	Probably the idea that something is very wrong. I am rather overweight, and I know that leads to major problems.
0.238100	I'm occasiolly nervous about what the diagnosis will be or if there will be one. There have been times that I've had to go back a few times before being referred and finding out what is really wrong. 
0.642900	That they will say something that is not what I wanted to hear. Also that they might now really look into what is going on.
0.595200	Sometimes I just get worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I will need surgery or something too costly.
0.547600	I just don't like the sterility and seriousness in the office. It's not because I'm afraid of what's he's going to tell me.
0.571400	That something will be seriously wrong
0.714300	My condition is serious and currently I am in remission but every time I have a new scan and go to the doctor there is a chance something could show up so I am anxious
0.333300	I feel most anxious while I am waiting for test results to come back. Most often they are not bad news but it is the waiting that gets to me.
0.428600	Not knowing whats going on or why I feel the way I do (symptoms). Not knowing how long the wait times are.
0.738100	Going to the doctor is always a nerve-wracking experience. You never know what news you could get after a health examition.
0.714300	I don't like going to places I'm unfamiliar with. I don't like seeing sick people. Doctors offices usually have a real sad, depressing and anxious environment and feeling. 
0.428600	Just the anxiety of waiting to hear if anything is seriously wrong. I get worried when I have to wait, but I'm usually reassured in the end.
0.142900	The only time I would feel anxious is if I think something is really seriously wrong and then I would worry about the outcome.
0.857100	He always tries to prescribe pills to me I don't want to take. An example is my blood pressure is normal, and yet he stills tries for me to get high blood pressure pills.
0.690500	That the doctor will find something wrong with my health.
0.357100	How long it takes. The test that I have to take.
0.785700	I feel anxious because I know my problems will be over looked or shoved off as not important. It makes me unhappy to be wasting my time. 
0.476200	I get anxious because I am afraid that the dr. will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. 
0.309500	Nothing in particular. As I said, I've been going to the same place for years, so I'm very comfortable there. I get a bit anxious when I'm sitting there waiting, simply because I hate waiting for anything.
0.714300	I guess wondering whether or not they are going to be honest with me. If I knew they are going to try to push an antibiotic or prescription, I'd already be defensive. I don't take pharmaceuticals. 
0.285700	I am sometimes worried that I'm not going to pass one of the tests and will have some sort of condition. Before going in, I feel like I don't know how healthy I am. 
0.785700	I usually assume the worst, when I have a doctors visit. Most of the time I was right. 
0.523800	The results of tests and what might be wrong with my body.
0.761900	not knowing what they will find, or even if they will listen to what is going on with me
0.142900	The one thing that would bring about this feeling is not knowing. When you have to wait on test results and you dont know what will be the outcome. 
1.000000	"Everything. The sights, sounds, smells... The possibility of learning something terrible about my health... The vulnerability of having to undress in front of people I don't know well... The humiliation of having issues blamed on my weight... I had a terrible pediatrician as a kid who berated and terrified me and snuck up on me with vaccitions, and I've had a lot of medical anxiety ever since. My ""white coat syndrome"" in regard to my blood pressure when I see a doctor is HORRIBLE."
0.404800	If I think something is actually wrong with me. I'll be a bit nervous until I get the results. Usually I try to keep calm.
0.404800	
0.666700	I am a very paranoid person when it comes to my health. Health is one of the most important things in this world so I am always concerned about losing my health. Even though I live a relatively healthy lifestyle and am young I still worry more than I should. 
0.142900	Not knowing how something is going to turn out. Whether a test is going to give not so great results or something else like that.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious in a doctor's office is the uncertainty of it. I don't like feeling bad and not knowing what is wrong, and wondering about the diagnosis can be nervewracking.
0.261900	Doing blood work. 
0.857100	I always worry if they will find something wrong.  As I get older, this is more likely.
0.381000	Bad surprises.  Not getting satisfactory answers and/or individual attention
0.238100	I know that my physician will want to spend less than 5 minutes with my care and that annoys me. I feel anxious in order to get my most immediate needs out as quickly as possible knowing that he will soon sprint for the door. I do not feel that I am receiving adequate care with him and am looking to change physicians.
0.190500	Just that something might be wrong but only slightly have the feeling
0.404800	That I will be forced into a new medication that my body won't tolerate. 
0.690500	I worry that my doctor would find something wrong with me. I want to go in there alive, and come out fine without any problems. I'm also not comfortable with people touching me, even if it is my doctor.
0.714300	What might be found that I wasn't aware of or couldn't see.  No one wants bad news, especially at the doctors!
0.142900	I don't really get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office.  I don't see a reason to get anxious or worried when in most cases the illness you have is just something simple or common.  Even if it is a rarer disease, it can usually be treated in some way.  
0.785700	I am an anxious person to begin with, so waiting in a public area with other people is already nerve wracking on it's own. I also have trouble talking with people I know well about my problems, so the idea of divulging intimate physical problems makes me very nervous.
0.285700	I usually expect the worse. I usually find out my fears were unfounded and the problem is easily solved.
0.214300	I think most anxiety/worries just come from not knowing what is going to happen
0.142900	possibly finding out some bad news
0.142900	As a healthy person i usually visit once a year for basic blood work
0.476200	I only feel anxious when I feel I have a problem that may require further visits. I have little or no anxiety with check ups or other tests. The only other times when I am anxious is when I have a problem so bad that it interferes with my life.
0.333300	Just the thought that some illness may be discovered that I have.
0.285700	I don't want to be diagnosed with a serious condition, I'm not anxious about seeing the doctor but the possibility that something is seriously wrong with my health
0.738100	I don't like the feeling of being exposed to strangers. I don't want to find out information that might make me change something drastic in my life.
1.000000	Another appointment with nothing getting done and feeling the same or worse when i leave the doctors office.   They said surgery wont help me but wont give me anything that helps make me comfortable.  
0.666700	Just that he might find something terribly wrong, or he missed something on a previous exam. Or something small that I don't think about turns out to be very important. Like a small pain or something that I don't think about turns out to be a symptom of something worse.
0.476200	The lighting in most of the doctor's offices seem to mess with my anxiety. I don't care to sit in those rooms waiting on the doctor. Depending what I am going for I may get nervous of the results. 
0.523800	Worrying about blood results coming back
0.595200	I'm always concerned that there might be some hidden condition that I am uware of that the doctor will find on a visit. I also dislike any sort of pain or discomfort during an examition. The worst part for me is waiting alone in the exam room before he comes in - my imagition is working overtime at that point.
0.285700	I don't get too anxious but i would probably have to say when they check my blood pressure.
0.238100	If my condition or the doctor find something that turns out to be worst than it really is. Or the doctor find something that's too late to be treated.
0.785700	when the doctor recommend and prescribes a drug that has interactions with other drugs that i am taking and his nurse warns him and he says give it to him anyway
0.904800	finding something wrong with me.changing my meds
0.857100	I guess it would be the waiting game. Waiting to get the test, then waiting for the results, waiting for the call that everything is fine, you hope and pray. 
0.142900	The only thing that  has ever worried me is having symptoms that doesn't have a clear diagnosis. At that point, the doctor has to guess just like I would. 
0.381000	nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when going to the doctor i am just turally that way. it isnt being there that is causing the feelings its just life in general
0.142900	Because I have dealt with cancer in the past, this would be my most main concern when going for check-ups - that they would feel something suspicious.
0.857100	I'm worried they won't listen to me. I'm worried I will encounter yet another doctor who does not care at all. I feel mistrustful after previous experiences.
0.761900	They're fairly sterile and I generally feel concerned about what possible medical problems I could have.
0.190500	I don't have any worry when I go to the doctor's office in regards to my health. I currently do not have insurance so what would make me most anxious is I have something wrong that requires a lot of medical attention.
0.666700	You never know when they are going to find something that is going to be a problem.  Even when you feel healthy, an exam always makes me anxious.
0.428600	The thing that makes me the most worried is wondering if my doctor will diagnose me with some sort of rare sickness that will cost a lot of money or if he will have to check my testicles for cancer. 
0.190500	Just the waiting in the office to be seen and hearing everyone else cough and sneeze makes me anxious
0.142900	I feel most anxious when I see a doctor for pain or strange symptoms. I get worried that something is really wrong with me.
0.142900	Hearing bad news.
0.571400	I'm occasiolly worried about what I will be diagnosed with.
0.571400	I guess it's because I really don't like doctors. They are not always honest to you.
0.595200	Only that they might find something I'm not aware of. I am almost 60 so anything could go wrong. 
0.428600	Just the visit itself.  I can't really put my finger on what exactly it is.  I just don't like being there.  I don't like when they come in and talk to you like you;re friends.  We;re not, lets just get this medical stuff over with.
0.190500	What makes me more anxious while visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what they will say about anything.
0.142900	What makes me feel most anxious is just the interaction with the doctor.  I respect his opinion.
0.619000	I don't like feeling exposed when undressed. I am nervous about the tests.
0.309500	I am most worried the doctor may come across a condition I was uware of, and that requires lots of treatment
0.452400	The bill, for one. I can self diagnose online for free. We only go to the doctor to get pills for a condition we didn't know we had. I would rather die a horrible cancerous death than bother going on chemo or any BS like that. There are numerous altertive medicines out there that can literally cure this, but since big pharma says no, doctors won't acknowledge it. That's where the mistrust and anxiety comes in.
0.571400	I don't like needles. If I have to have my blood drawn I'm anxious. I get useated by the experience. 
0.761900	I think it's just fear of the unknown. I wonder whether I've developed some type of illness since my last visit, and let that fear take me to some dark places.
0.666700	I feel like they don't really care that much and don't even try to pretend to.  They are quick to prescribe pills before any other options.
0.214300	Just the wait and time it takes to get through everything.
0.571400	to hear some bad news about my health
0.571400	Mostly when I feel worried or anxious it's because I'm paranoid that something is wrong with me and I'm about to find out some terrible news.
1.000000	I have been sick most of my life. My anxiety is spiked when I have to deal with a new nurse, or sometimes the regular Dr is not in when I go to my appt, I prefer just my primary care provider. I do not trust the others very much.
0.690500	I fear physical aging of the body such as joint pain and also breast cancer, which my mother passed from.
0.404800	The waiting in a close small space, although I am not claustrophobic.  
0.571400	I am never that anxious, but if I am it is usually jut generalized anxiety that i always have. I have social anxiety in almost every social situation.
0.381000	I am always concerned the doctor is going to find something seriously wrong with me, something i have not noticed. Like a tumor or cancer or some type of STD. 
0.738100	At one point I was having severe stomach and abdomil pain.  I went to the doctors believing that my appendix may have ruptured.  The dr did the necessary test to determine that was not the case and it was just a serve case of acid and the proper form of treatment to releave the symptoms
0.142900	Nothing.
0.261900	They always seem to find something wrong with me.  I am waiting for the cancer word to come up because I tend to have everything.
0.476200	the fear of the unknown, especially at my age, is what makes me worried.  Everyone has the fear of cancer.
0.642900	I have longstanding health problems and I'm always worried they are going to say there are signs that they are getting worse. This makes me anxious and worried.
0.738100	i had having female check ups those seem so invasive
0.690500	I always am worried about what is going on with me or if she will find something out that I don't know about.  I feel horribel getting on the scale and am embarrassed 
0.714300	I am more worried about being taken seriously for pain and symptoms I am having even though I have rarely had experiences where they were dismissed. I am also usually worried about the outcome or source of discomfort or symptoms. 
0.404800	The fear that you have something worse than what you really have.
0.357100	I usually feel anxious when waiting for the results of tests
0.166700	I have no this filling when visiting the doctor's office. I'm confident in my doctor.
0.309500	The ever-present possibility of long wait times. 
0.381000	The one thing that makes me feel even slightly anxious is the idea that I somehow may have contracted some sort of disease that I would have not noticed without going to the doctor.
0.785700	cause i know he doesn't care.  i think i have white coat syndrome too where i get nervous...especially with the new doctor.  He knows nothing about me.  So i just don't go to the doctor.  I've had a cold for 3 weeks and won't go.
0.238100	I do not get anxious around doctors.
0.523800	I just don't like going. It's a fear of the unkown, and not wanting there to be anything bad wrong.
0.619000	My family has a lot of health problems. While I have been relatively healthy for my whole life so far, things could change at any time. I get nervous that I won't have my health in a future situation, so I try to do everything I can to stay healthy so I can live an active life. 
0.285700	I would say that I feel most anxious when the doctor's facial expression says something before they even tell me.  if the doctor looks discouraged about test results I usually become anxious or worried.
0.642900	After having some tests done, I'm always fearful while waiting for the results.  She will usually tell me what to expect, but I worry about everything. 
0.738100	I am worried that my doctor will tell me I have a disease or that I am overweight. Or he'll tell me that I need to start eating better.
0.666700	I worry the doctor might detect an illness/defect I was not aware of or something that may affect me adversely.  
0.785700	I hate needles I hate the blood pressure machine my health is reasobly good it's just I don't like being poked and prodded
0.214300	Simply not knowing the outcome is what would bother me.  Most of the time it is nothing, but the fact that it could be something serious makes me a little anxious from time to time.
0.738100	I never know what could be wrong with me.  I'm most worried about not knowing what the procedure might entail, if anything will hurt, and if a new condition will be discovered.
0.166700	The wait time.
0.452400	I just don't enjoy being poked and prodded by other people. I also have received some unfortute medical diagnoses (melanoma twice) in the last year, so it makes me a little worried that it will come back. 
0.595200	When I visit the doctors office it is usually for a reason, and I am worried that it will be a larger health concern than I would like to have. For example, I worry that the bump on my ear must be removed by surgery and thinking about hearing that makes me anxious. 
0.523800	I am always worried that they will tell me something is wrong.  Going to the doctor gives me general anxiety.
0.309500	That they will find something unexpected that is detrimental to my health.
0.428600	Without a doubt, giving blood or receive a vaccition such as a flu shot. I really don't like needles:)
0.381000	What makes me most anxious is just being around people, and having the environment be chaotic and loud. 
1.000000	"I basically have ""white coat"" syndrome. Everything about a doctors office scares me. It just makes me feel like I am in danger even though nothing is wrong."
0.333300	The unknown or possible conditions that could be found. 
0.571400	them tell me something bad 
0.404800	What makes me feel anxious is whether I am going to get new information or not.
0.619000	the uncertainty of whats wrong with me, and if they can fix it and HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
0.690500	I always worry about hearing bad news. 
0.690500	If he's going to find something wrong with me
0.142900	I fear that maybe i'll walk out with a deadly illness
0.357100	I feel in many cases that the answers I get are just stock answers. No thinking out of the box. I would have zero issues if my doctor asked me to exercise or eat better for 2 weeks and then come back as a suggestion. Instead, it feels like receiving a pill is what I usually get. That is when I feel anxious of what just happened and worried that I won't get better. 
0.500000	I feel worried that I will not be able to describe the problems that I am having because I don't remember things about them, like how often they occur and for how long. I feel worried that I will be told I am unhealthy and that will mean that I am lazy. I feel worried that if I let on about the stress in my life, I will be referred into therapy I do not want and my parents will make a big deal of it.
0.809500	I am worried that something might be wrong with my health, but mostly if I had a bad health last time. Otherwise I like getting my checkups. I try to rarely go to the doctors though. 
0.142900	I am always calm in the Dr's office.  I don't worry until there is something to worry about.
0.595200	I feel worried that something is going to turn out more negative than I expect. That the doctor will find something wrong that I wasn't expecting or give me bad news.
0.309500	Not much, usually. If I have to discuss an embarrassing issue I could be nervous, maybe. 
0.690500	Will I need any bloodwork done? Will I have to fight them to convince them to change my birth control or acknowledge my bi-annual sinus infections that I've gotten like clockwork since I was 16? 
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious or worried when I go visit a doctor. 
0.452400	I am worried that I won't be able to get my prescription any more.
0.666700	treated me as if I were a number would not listen to my needs for anitboitics insisted on new meds that are not time tested and proved
0.285700	Potential health issues.
0.690500	I just feel like the doctor might not take my opionions seriously and maybe rude to me. I also fear there maybe something seriously wrong.
0.428600	how much the price of meds will be
0.619000	Sometimes I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me that I don't know about yet. 
0.666700	I'm nervous to begin with and do not like going to doctors to begin with and then you add the added anxiety of them finding something wrong, so yes I do feel anxiety going to the doctor for a couple reasons.
0.738100	I feel this way because I do not know what the doctor is going to respond with after he alyzes my condition.  I am then feeling stressed because I will ultimately have to sift through the facts and determine how I want to proceed.  I get worried because I am afraid the doctor is going to provide a misdiagnosis or find something else wrong I may not have needed to know about at the time.
0.190500	I have a history of medical problems. Every time I go to the doctors I pray nothing else will be wrong. Along with my current issues are stable/improving. 
0.261900	If I have an ailment, I'm most worried about how much time and cost I will have to dedicate to having it treated.
0.714300	A doctor, whether they like it or not, has a certain amount of power over their patients, and I have a lot of trouble dealing with situations where people have power over me (and I have been justified in that concern). It's stressful having to be in situations of uncertainty or where I don't have the control I want.
0.547600	Misdiagnose me or just scam me into spending more.
0.261900	"I always worry about getting that ""I don't know what's causing your problems"" answer - or worse yet, the clear implication that it's ""all in my head."" I fear the doctor won't find anything, when I absolutely know that something is wrong."
0.142900	The only thing I ever feel anxious or worried about is (1) waiting too long for the doctor to appear and (2) worry about whether I going to get a nurse who will do a painless job with the needle!
0.738100	You never know what they are going to find.  Even if you feel totally healthy they could tell you something is wrong.  That is what makes me feel anxious.
0.666700	The fear that something might be wrong.
0.738100	that he will find something that is untreatable.
0.261900	Hoping the report will turn out fine as usual
0.571400	He telling me that something is wrong with my results.
0.500000	I worry that I am going to receive news that I have a physical illness that went undetected before. I'm worried that I might have cancer, diabetes, or heart issues. I am obese, so my weight is of great concern. 
0.523800	I am usually worried that my blood pressure will be high. The anxiety ends up making my blood pressure high. It is sort of a cycle. 
0.738100	I often feel anxious or worried about them always wanting to discuss my weight. Not my problem the reason I am there. They are always trying to blame me being overweight a little.
0.309500	Just the possibility of things that could go wrong. Things could always go awry. The doctor could always find something that you did not know you had going on.
0.142900	I feel anxious that the doctor will be in a rush and I will not be able to ask questions I have.
0.142900	I get a little anxious if I have to wait awhile for my physician. Sometimes I'm worried if something new is bothering me and finding out what it is. 
0.547600	The fact of what could be wrong makes me anxious.  I don't know if I have an issue that will require further medical attention.
0.381000	It's not a remark on my confidence in my doctor; it's more of the fact that I'm worried that I have some underlying condition that is more serious than I anticipated.
0.714300	I think I worry the most about what could be wrong. Even though I'm in excellent health, I have somewhat of a fear that something could be wrong with me when I go in.
0.476200	Nothing specific.  I do not take great care of myself and have a rough family medical history.
0.642900	Normally it's a matter of having to wait to hear back from them that makes me anxious. I dislike waiting for exams and tests to come back. 
0.547600	i just do not like being touched by people i am not close with. i also hate waiting to see if something is wrong with me
0.666700	I'm always afraid that he will find something knowing that I'm not a spring chicken.
0.666700	worry that something is wrong
0.142900	I never feel anxious when I visit the doctor. The few times in my life when I did it was only because I thought the illness I was experiencing might be indicative of something very serious. I was worried about the diagnosis but not the doctor.
0.476200	When I am there for symptoms. Also the anxious feeling is there because no one taught me how to go to doctors and make appointments for myself.
0.666700	When visiting the doctor , I sometimes feel anxious because of the unknown. You never know what a doctor is going to tell you. If something is wrong , I always have the feeling it will be something horrible...
0.642900	I worry the the doctor might find a serious issue that will negatively affect my life. I also sometimes worry that the doctor will not be able to diagnose me properly and I might have to go to another physician.
0.714300	"The physical vulnerability makes me antsy - I'm a very physically private person, so the examition itself usually makes me uneasy. And then of course there's the ""what if"" thoughts of what could be the worst-case scerio."
0.285700	"I am most worried about the ""fear of the unknown"".  In other words, will the doctor discover something that I am not aware of.   I am not worried about taking any shots or vaccines - but more worried on what I don't know at this point about my health."
0.547600	How long the affair is going to take. How poor the doctor's bedside manner is going to be. How much of my problem's they'll casually write off as being about my weight and nothing more. Whether or not they'll believe me about problems I'm having.
0.381000	I get nervous when it gets really persol such as at the OBGYN and I also hate getting shots or blood work done.
0.333300	I am a general worrier anyway. Going to the doctor for a general check-up does not worry me. But If I am having any kind of strange symptom I may being to woryy or become anxious over what could be the problem.
0.452400	I'm a turally anxious person. I think I go into the doctor's office with the fear that something is wrong, so I'm worried that I'll be right in that assumption. I'm nervous that I'll be scolded for not being perfect.
0.547600	I always get a little nervous when I go to the doctor so my blood pressure raises. That makes me more anxious that I'll have an extremely high blood pressure when they take it. Something about being at a doctors office is slightly off putting.
0.309500	if it isn't something that is easily diagnosed then there would be cause for concern. most of the time it's a cold or a cough so not anxious usually.,
0.142900	I am not usually those things unless there is a really big issue. 
0.642900	I get uncomfortable if any clothing removal is involved. Also, I get a little nervous that something might hurt. I also get nervous that something is wrong and it won't get noticed.
0.333300	That they will misdiagnose or miss something completely, or not even pay attention to what I'm saying.
0.571400	The thought that something completely insane might be discover like cancer
0.142900	Not knowing what is wrong with me and hoping that it isn't the worst case scerio.
0.428600	I usually feel most anxious when I am waiting, waiting to be brought back to the exam and waiting to see the doctor. I also get anxious when I feel sick and don't know what's wrong with me, the unknown makes me worried.
0.595200	I am worried about the doctor finding an issue or something wrong. I am scared that the doctor will find something serious or something incurable. 
0.404800	The reason I feel anxious or worried while visiting the doctors is because I generally only go if I am having problems so I'm turn I usually am thinking the worst diagnosis possible. 
0.214300	The fear that a serious condition could be found. It's really the noting of mortality, that something with the body could be malfunctioning.
0.738100	Not knowing what to expect.  Potential for more tests.
0.809500	I feel anxious because I always feel like he is going to find something wrong with me.
0.619000	I'm always worried that he may find something terribly wrong with me. I'm always worried about cancer.
0.476200	My health might have problems makes me worried. My health also might be worse than last time.
0.666700	I think for me there is always the fear of what will they find that I don't know about, the what if something is really wrong fear. Other than that the exam, albeit uncomfortable at times is not really an issue. 
0.761900	I'm always afraid that something serious will come up that I was uware of.
0.476200	Because I have some current and past health issues, I am often anxious about whether these health issues may be negatively effecting my health in a serious way. I am also nervous that my doctor may ask me questions that I am nervous to answer because I feel I might've done something to negatively effect my health.
0.571400	idk
0.238100	They might find something seriously wrong.
0.214300	nothing really
0.666700	If the doctor seems preoccupied or spends little time with me and leaves my care in the hands of his nurse, that concerns me.  When his staff makes a mistake, that worries me.
0.809500	I get worried that something may be getting worse like my blood pressure or my blood sugar levels and that I will have to deal with new medical problems.
0.619000	I feel anxious when the doctor makes me uncomfortable or talks down to me. Additiolly, if the nurses or front desk staff are rude when I walk in, I start to feel uneasy.
0.857100	Pap smears make me very uncomfortable. I do not like getting ked in front of my doctor. I often leave the hospital feeling violated.
0.619000	There is always a feeling of unknown when visiting the doctor's office. Even if I feel healthy, there's always a little doubt that something could be wrong. That's where the anxiety and worry comes from.
0.142900	I really don't think like there's anything, since her and her office folks make me feel completely at ease. Possibly what my blood pressure is going to be.
0.714300	"Because when I am there, it is usually because something is wrong that I do not understand myself and need answers for. This type of thing makes me worried because I get that fear of ""what is wrong""."
0.881000	I worry that my blood pressure will be high. I worry about being diagnosed with cancer. I'm 66 and feel my mortality.
0.476200	I'm at the age where 29 years of firefighting are catching up with me. This is wehre the weird cancers, heart problems, etc start coming in . I will probably have to take early retirement due to my TBI, so I am dreading that
0.523800	Not knowing what results the doctor will find.
0.619000	I hate shots, giving blood, etc., and will do anything I can to avoid them.  I wish there was a way for the doctor to put me more at ease.  I don't think it's her responsibility to do this, but I have had experiences where I felt much more at ease depending on the person when I've had to give blood.  
0.190500	That he may find something wrong. Even though it would perhaps be able to get better, sometimes ignorance is bliss.
0.238100	I think it is just an overall feeling I get from seeing a doctor.  I have never been good at doctors offices or hospitals, they just give me an overall nervous feeling that I can't really explain.
0.142900	I don't generally go to the doctor's office very much except for a routine check up. It doesn't make me feel very anxious or worried because I am fairly healthy and active for a woman of my age, and I don't see why anything would go wrong or if anything negative would happen when I am having nothing going on.
0.190500	I feel worried about my possible diagnosis. I worry that I might get sick more than I really am. I know my doctor will help me, but if I catch something bad, there's only so much she can do.
1.000000	I worry that something will be very wrong with me or worse yet they will fail to find something that is horribly wrong. Additiolly I will have to worry that they will not take my concerns into account. 
0.500000	"Waiting in the office after my vitals are taken and before the doctor comes in.  Also waiting for test results - anxious about the ""what ifs""."
0.976200	I am always concerned that something will be wrong with me. I have and still do drink heavily. I am scared that one day something concerning those risks taken will be serious. 
0.523800	I feel anxious or worried that something more serious may be wrong than is really the case. I also become anxious about the possibility of having to get any additiol tests given to me because often times my doctor's office is not very quick about getting results to me, so I will wait and worry about test results. 
0.142900	The most worried I get is being concerned about having to wait to long to be seen.  Other than that, there isn't much to be worried or anxious about.  Whatever I am there for, the doctor will do his best.
0.833300	I've had doctors insult me, accuse me of lying, or jump to false conclusions. I don't feel safe in a doctor's office.
0.261900	Its the waiting in a crowded room.
0.523800	I worry about being lectured about my health and also having to go through the whole procedure of tests. I don't like it.
0.690500	I get anxious wondering if I will have health problems.
0.714300	That a problem will be discovered
0.142900	nothing, I feel fine when I go. 
0.261900	The waiting while in an office that smells of sickness. If it wasn't for the smell it wouldn't be so bad but they always smell.
0.571400	I am working hard to improve my health and I always get worried that my tests will show that I have regressed in my work.  I also worry that at some point it may come back and tell me that I have developed a serious health issue that will require lifestyle changes.
0.571400	Doctors usually are hurried and that makes me anxious. I usually have questions and I'm worried that I won't have time to ask them. Or I worry about whether the doctor will listen to me and help me. I have been dismissed so often by doctors, especially for my children. 
0.738100	Being examined and evaluated more than anything. Insecurity, if I had to put it another way.
0.595200	Them finding something wrong with me that isn't easy to fix.
0.142900	Getting sick from other patients. 
0.500000	Needles primarily, but once it happens it isn't htat bad. It's the anticipation that bothers me.
0.690500	Everything about going to the doctor gives me anxiety. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, so it can not really be helped. I am concerned that I will only hear bad news, or that the doctor will be cold and judgemental, or any other number of things that could be negative about the experience. 
0.619000	What they may find or tell me what is wrong.
0.142900	I don't usually feel anxious or worried about going to my doctor. If there are problems, then I will deal with them when they arise. Only time I'm a bit apprehensive is if I need to see a new doctor.
0.238100	Just know I don't go enough and dont stay on top of my health and past health issues so when I go I am slightly worried about things I neglected to keep checking on being worse 
0.690500	Being judged. Having to get kid. 
0.142900	That I'll have a super long wait. I really don't get nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.166700	It does make me worried if I have some sort of condition that feels unresolved or it could worsen. I know it is good to figure out what is going on, but it worries me to imagine what it could be.
0.690500	not being able to properly explain my condition and not receiving adequate treatment
0.642900	I get irratiol fears that my ear infection will somehow end up being cancer. This is the mindset I normally have when I visit the doctors so I normally have a healthy amount of anxiety when I have to go in.
0.952400	I am afraid I might be told something I don't want to hear, such as cancer.
0.452400	I can feel anxious about my doctor finding something wrong with me.
0.595200	Honestly, just the thought of having to go into the office and waiting. I have gotten to the point in my life now where I freely discuss health issues and concerns. 
0.642900	I am most worried about the doctor telling me that something is wrong (like finding a lump) and that farther testing will be required. Some things cant be found or will go unnoticed until you visit a doctor, and I am most scared about some illness creeping up on me.
0.214300	I, like most people, have a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. This stems purely from not knowing if something is wrong with me that I might not have noticed. I stay in shape, and have a healthy routine, but there is always the chance that something is lurking underneath. 
0.119000	I honestly have no anxiety when meeting with my doctor. I enjoy the process. 
0.547600	Am I going to have the issue addressed or will I have it out aside again.
0.238100	"I'm turning 40 this year, so I do get a little anxious these days when I go to the doctor. There's always a little ""what if he finds something"" voice in the back of my head, even though I'm quite healthy overall. I don't really mind going all that much, though."
0.666700	Probably that they will find something horrible. They are going to tell me i'm to fat and to quit smoking. Both are easy to say but hard to do.
0.142900	I'm more anxious to see if the thoughts I have on what the issue are line up to his. If they do then I already kind of know the course of treatment so there is no mystery.
0.642900	Even if I feel healthy, I get worried that there is something wrong. Also, I don't visit the doctor often so I get anxious about being in an unfamiliar place. Since it is so far between times I visit a doctor I get worried that I waited too long for them to diagnose.
0.190500	I'm worried that I may have a hidden condition of some sort. I generally feel healthy, but there is also a small thought in the back of my head that I may have hidden, lingering cancer or something. I don't want to get bad news. 
0.690500	Finding out that I might have a chronic disease.
0.190500	Not much really. It is a process I understand that has to take place and sometimes it is tedious and takes time to complete.  Too many blood draws on occasion 
0.404800	It's a little irratiol, but sometimes when I'm in the waiting room, I worry about that the doctor might find something terribly wrong. I know there's nothing really wrong because I feel fine, but in the back of my mind, I still think something might crop up that will be a terrible burden to treat. 
0.738100	I hate shots. I hate shots a LOT. I'm always in fear that my affliction will result in a blood test or a shot of some sort and that's when I get REALLY tense.
0.666700	I often worry that results from an exam or test will point to a disease or condition such as cancer. When I wait to hear back via email from a doctor regarding test results, it is often a tense and worrisome time. 
0.452400	I mostly just get worried that I will have some unforeseen symptom that they notice that could mean something bad. I also get worried I will need a shot that day.
0.142900	nothing i know my body and the health care system as well as my doctor so there is nothing to be anxious about
0.619000	"I guess there is always the possibility of seeing a doctor for a simple check-up and having them start a sentence with, ""Oh my god, why didn't you have this mole looked at sooner....you have a week to live."" I don't really think that way until I am half-dressed and being examined.  So I would say there is a moment of feeling vulnerable in that situation, but I don't obsess or anything."
0.642900	I'm anxious about what might be wrong with me and how much the treatments will cost.
0.285700	Nothing much really....
0.476200	Typically I am just worried something will come up during the exam. My doctor is capable of making me feel better. The diagnosis of things is typically explained properly as well with little questions from me.
0.809500	The fact that I would ever be in a position to where I would have to visit a doctor for anything.
0.285700	Maybe having bad results.
0.809500	I don't want to hear any bad news.  I just want to hear that all is well and I can go about my life.  I do not want to hear that something is worrisome and I need more tests, etc.
0.761900	Worried that I get diagnosed with a serious illness.
0.142900	In the past I had struggled with Anxiety and Depression. I do not currently struggle with these issues and they have since been resolved. Due to the ture and cultural stigma relating to mental health it was somewhat difficult for me to deliver my concerns verbally to my doctor. This made me feel very anxious and worried before my appointment, but once I filly maged to communicate my concerns I was put at ease by my doctors professiolism and demeanor regarding the issues. He helped a great deal my overcoming this medical condition and now I no longer have these issues and no longer need medication for this.
0.881000	How much my insurance will cover.  If the doctor will tell me something I don't want to know.  If they are going to treat me with respect and give me the time that I need.
0.571400	Fear that I may need to spend more money. Whether it's a follow up, a medication, or even just a test.
0.714300	I have a severe case of white coat syndrome. As soon as I walk into the office I start sweating profusely. Strange because I am a doctor...
0.666700	That they will push needless meds and tests and not do anything for me anyway. Doctor is no longer a noble profession
0.714300	If I have a health problem I usually get anxious over whether the doctor will be able to help me or not. I get worried about what tests or procedures might be necessary and whether any serious diseases might be discovered.
0.357100	There's a lot that I don't know when I go into a doctor's office, and I'm often concerned that I'm forgetting to say something that is relevant to my health. I don't know what is and isn't necessary to know, and the whole experience makes me aware of my own frailty and mortality in a way I usually am not.
0.738100	I am always afraid even if i  am doing  everything right that I'm going in and they are going to tell me bad news. I have what they call white coat syndrome and it makes me feel bad. 
0.666700	when i am experiencing a medical problem I sometimes have anxiety about it. The unknown makes me anxious 
0.928600	I worry about getting bad news. I worry about being judged. I worry about appearing nervous and anxious.
0.642900	I think the feeling of finding something seriously wrong. I've been lucky to not have very many medical problems in life so I only have to go to the doctor for something minor. It's not a familiar place so that makes for some anxious feelings overall. 
0.523800	I think it's just the fact that I could get really bad news at the doctor. 
0.428600	I tend to feel anxious whenever there strangers involved, especially professiols. I tend to be anxious all the time, especially when outside of places I'm comfortable with or familiar with, and a doctor's office is the furthest thing from a comfortable space to be in. That, and I'm always paranoid that I might unintentiolly make it more difficult for the doctor to actually do their job. I tend to breathe very differently, almost as if I'm trying to keep myself from showing any potential symptoms. Plus, my self-destructive tendencies (that are caused by my depression) tend to come in the form of me denying myself help, so even I mage to get to a doctor, I feel cornered. 
0.976200	Just nervous being at the doctor's office, I have anxiety every time even when it's just a simple check-up. Mainly the uncertainty.
0.166700	The thing that I experience the most anxiety from is the fact that there are other people at the office. I always have anxiety when being in the same room as multiple people. However, one on ones with the doctor or nurse doesn't bother me at all.
0.785700	The fear that something adverse may be discovered. Also the existential feeling of a lack of control over a possible health issue.
0.381000	I think there's always that worry in the back of your head that there may be something really wrong with you and the doctor is about to find it and tell you.
0.738100	I don't like doctors in general. I always worry they will find something that I don't know about. I have a great doctor, but it is just a scary process. The physical evaluation is also worrysome. I don't like people poking around my body. 
0.357100	I'm usually worried they won't believe me about whatever problem I'm having. I've had this happen multiple times, and both issues turned out being detectable, serious ones even though the first doctor didn't believe me.
0.238100	I have COPD. Each time I visit my doctor I half expect him to tell me my symptoms are getting worse and that the end is near.
0.523800	If I truly think something is wrong with me, then I am most anxious when she is  giving the physical examition.\
0.523800	I am worried that there will be something that will be expensive. Unfortutely we are in a position where we don't have great insurance coverage and we don't have a lot of savings so a medical issue could be very costly to us. 
0.714300	I lost trust , because i want doctors to tell the truth if they are not aware of some type of medical problem before, rather than using someone as a guinea pig for their experiment.
0.452400	If my blood pressure it too high, or my weight is too high.  I work out every day and I've been a healthy eater my whole life, so when my weight goes up, I get pretty upset because I feel like there's no reason for it.
0.500000	The bill I will receive 
0.619000	I guess I am always afraid that something will turn up on a test that I was not anticipating.  There are so many detriments that can lie dormant, and something may turn up even without symptoms.  In some cases, I tend to wonder whether its better to know than not, because then you begin to live as if you have the indientified ailment.
0.642900	I have a touch of health anxiety, so I tend to expect the worst. Even if my symptoms are fairly benign, my imagition gets the best of me.
0.285700	I don't normally feel anxious for myself, but i do get nervous for my child and unborn baby. I worry that a simple cold is actually cancer or that the baby will have some rare disease. With myself, I worry that I will have cancer and won't be able to raise my kids. The actual doctor doesn't make me nervous at all. 
0.214300	I feel anxious that something might be wrong with me. I worry that I might get diagnosed with something bad.
0.666700	I have past trauma that makes me not like to be touched.
1.000000	They want to make a healthy person sick by prescribing unnecessary tests and procedures to charge a huge bill, also lacking skills and giving incorrect diagnosis.
0.595200	there's always something in the back of your mind telling you it's worse than it is. Fortutely, it usually isn't.
0.952400	When I visit the doctor, I'm afraid that I am going to be very sick. This feeling comes even if I've had no symptoms or other serious illness
0.833300	I am most worried that my doctor will notice that my health has been going downhill since the last time I saw them. I am also uneasy about the physical examition that involves my doctor physically touching me under the hospital gown.
0.666700	That they'll find something seriously wrong with me. I'm always afraid I will have some termil illness.
0.714300	I just want answers, which is something I can never get. I really don't even care if the answers are not good, I just want some answers, that's all.
0.738100	I am worried if anything would be wrong. I'm worried what my doctor will think about me. 
0.309500	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fact that I always have to wait so long before seeing him.  Sometimes I might be in the waiting room for hours.
0.238100	When I do not know what is wrong with me.
0.214300	In case I am feeling bad about something that I think is the worst case scerio and I will not find out until he has examined me or ran some tests. Worrying is mostly in my head and not a result of the doctor himself.
0.595200	I have anxiety about a lot of things. I don't think it's something in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I just do and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what I'm anxious/worried about. 
0.642900	I don't feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. I usually feel relieved that something that is going on is going to get taken care of here. I don't like to go to the doctor but I feel better once I know what is going on with my health than not knowing. 
0.785700	Going to the doctor makes me uneasy because it's so persol and I'm concerned there may be something more serious happening.
0.738100	finding something else wrong
0.142900	The most worrisome thought would be they're going to find out some things wrong that can't be fixed. I mean if you find out you have to take medicine or have a light surgery it's fine. You go there and they tell you that you have cancer, or heart failure all because you went there because you had a slight cough and are slightly fatigued..... I mean who expects that to happen?
0.500000	Not knowing what they're going to tell me or what test they're going to pressure me into taking, which will cost me extra money.
0.142900	I can't. I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I feel calm and indifferent, and a bit bored.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor's office. If anything, I might be worried about arriving late to the appointment. I wouldn't like being late.
0.476200	I am most anxious about the unknown and having routine tests uncover something serious that I wasn't aware of. So far there have been no major problems but as I get older I am expecting something sooner or later.
0.666700	I always expect a clean bill of health but I get anxious and worry that they will find something wrong with me and that is why i do not like to go. Id rather not know
0.809500	I worry about what disease I may have after reading information online about causes of severe pain. I worry about my organs and as I age, there seem to be more things wrong and more things that I have concerns about.
0.619000	Fear of the unknown. I have come because something is wrong and I do not know the answer and I will have a long wait and this will be all I am thinking about because  have to reschedule my whole day to do it.
0.595200	What might come of the visit. Not seeing my doctor, just what may or may not be wrong.
0.523800	I'm little bit afraid of bad news.
0.571400	You worry about what could possibly be wrong with you. Worry about getting certain things done. or worry about how people percieve you.
0.476200	That my doctor will find a new problem with me. That I have a new bacteria or that I have a big problem;
0.523800	What makes me feel most anxious/worried about when I visit a doctor's office is finding out if something could possibly be wrong with me.
0.476200	Sometimes if I need bloodwork done I worry about the results, but other than that nothing really upsets me. 
0.428600	I'm getting ked in front of a mostly complete stranger who is poking and prodding me, literally looking for things that are wrong...
0.595200	Just the notion that a test result could reveal something bad.  Cancer, for instance. 
0.166700	I rarely get anxious at the doctors office.  If I go to the doctor when I feel like something may be wrong, then I may be anxious until I know that it is not something serious.
0.166700	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is if he finds something to be concerned about.
0.642900	I have not been anxious from going to a doctors office in a while.  Everything that I have been told in a while was what I was expecting.
0.857100	I feel like my doctor is judging my body. I feel like I am inferior because I am not in good health and have many problems compared to my doctor.
0.619000	I worry that the doctor will find something that i am uware of. I fear what they find will be painful or expensive to treat.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel nervous about seeing a doctor
0.571400	I'm worried about something being wrong with me or something that I would not expect. Also the time can be long in waiting and that makes me anxious.
0.452400	I am not sure what the outcome will be. Is he going to give me any news I may not want to hear.
0.285700	If I have been very ill for a long time and there has been nothing to help me for a long time, I would worry wondering if the test results would show some dangerous illness like cancer, aids, etc. which could kill me soon.
1.000000	When I had to go in for a CT scan of my head after a surgery (I moved shortly after this surgery so this hospital was new), the doctors started freaking out because there was a significant amount of blood around my brain, which we knew about after my surgery. They however didn't and they admitted me and were contemplating doing emergency surgery even though I wasn't displaying any alarming symptoms like I should have. Long story short, that even made me terrified of going to the doctor, because being hospitalized that rapidly even though I felt fine was really disturbing, and to think that if things didn't work out for me, I could have never seen the outside world again just like that. 
0.428600	Being in a doctor's office makes me feel anxious because I am vulnerable and surrounded by people I do not know. That is an uncomfortable situation for me. 
0.595200	them telling me something that I don't want to hear
0.523800	I have no problem with being in a doctor's office since I used to work in one. But, I do hate when they take my vitals then have me sit for a half hour before doing their quick 5 minute check up. 
0.142900	The only thing I get worried about is what my number on the scale will be. (weight)
0.761900	That I will receive bad news but mostly because of my social anxiety as soon as I come in I'm terrified. 
0.428600	I feel most anxious when I have something wrong with my health that I am worried about. 
0.619000	For my mother, any visit to the doctor's office is a possible event filled with dread. Has the cancer spread to her brain yet? How long will she be able to breathe effectively before the tumors in her lungs over power her? For myself? I'm basically as healthy as a horse and entirely apathetic about it.
0.714300	Getting results back from tests when trying to find out if certain symptoms may be signs of a new condition or decline in health will make me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. 
0.238100	Not much really, unless I'm going there because I think there is really something wrong with me. Like finding a lump in my breast or something of that kind. But generally, I feel fine when I go there.
0.500000	What makes me feel anxious sometimes is seeing other patients with various ailments waiting to see their doctors. When I'm thinking there might be something wrong with me, it unsettles me a bit to see other people who aren't well.
0.142900	When I am feeling ill and I don't have a good idea about what is wrong.
0.547600	I worry about getting bad news. I also don't really like strangers touching me so this causes anxiety.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. 
0.142900	When I am going in with something that I dont know about and how it will turn out. I mostly go for my annual physicals. I never have ailments. So if I ever had an ailment and had to go in I would be very anxious.
0.666700	"A lot of them have elitism or an ego about them. I expereinced this several times with doctors. Or while you are sitting there at your lowest point, barely able to hold your head up, they will talk down to you. YES THEY DO. fuck em. Sorry but I can't with medical doctors. There is so much intellectual elitism and yet they haven't actually ""cured"" anyone of diseases because the underlying issue of what everyone is eating isn't addressed. We act like if we can eat it, it's our food source and will go in and out of the body. Unfortutely people forget that in anything, if you burn dirty, or the wrong fuel, you will RUIN the machine/your body."
0.785700	I am most anxious or worried about receiving bad news or requiring a procedure that I'm not comfortable with.
0.166700	Just general anxiety because I've experienced a lot of incorrect diagnoses, and as a result, been prescribed medicine that has a very negative effect on me. I worry about not being listened to. I dread the patient blame that I've experienced.  
0.500000	More so the results of testing or the results for why Im there.
0.523800	I get anxious when I visit the doctor's office because of the fear of what could be wrong. I think that it is deep rooted from the loss of my first born child.
0.285700	I am not at all anxious or worried about anything.  My doctor is just wonderful.  I go every six months.  I was just there, and he is a great doctor.
0.738100	I am mostly nervous about the cost of the visit.  To a lesser extent I am worried about what he might find (ie cancer) or something of that ture. 
0.238100	How long I will be sitting there.
0.833300	I get anxious thinking they will think less of me for how little I've taken care of myself. Which is not true really. I exercise every day. Literally every day. The results are not very noticeable, but I would be WAY worse off if I didn't exercise. 
0.142900	What makes mw feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office is finding out that there could be something seriously wrong with me and also having to get a shot or blood drawn.
0.500000	I just get anxious for some reason.  I don't like being told something is wrong with me so I get worried.  Also I hate having to give blood or do other procedures that could hurt.
0.190500	Except for routine visits, I go to the physician because of an acute condition. I usually know the best and usual course of treatment because I have researched it prior to the visit. I am anxious because my physician is sometimes blase and doesn't show the concern that I would expect.
0.238100	Sometimes I see the doctor for exams and they will draw blood so I feel a little anxious
0.642900	That they won't hear me. Or that I'll get some dreadful diagnosis and then be faced with decisions that I don't want to make.
0.404800	Having something wrong with me that will require me to take a medication that is the only option to cure what is wrong with me but at the same time will have side effects which will continue to effect me for a while.
0.142900	I dislike going to the doctor in general so I always feel anxious being in a doctors office.
0.404800	I worry that test results will come back showing something wrong. These worries are usually unfounded.
0.309500	I feel upset if I am being taken care of by a PA/NP instead of an MD. I am wary of their diagnosis or whether or not they are able to give a better assessment than the MD.
0.381000	I am most worried that my doctor will find a new problem or disease when I am examined. I don't want a new disease to deal with. I am also worried that I will lose my health insurance and I won't be able to afford treatment.
0.714300	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office when I am awaiting any test results or physical examitions. I worry because I fear something may be wrong and I would need medical treatment.
0.357100	Since I have a mental health issue on top of physical health issues, am always anxious that they will not take me seriously when I complain of some heart related issue (although I have a heart history).  Unfortutely, a mental health issue is rather like having a giant red mark following you around and often professiols have a hard time looking beyond that for another explation for a problem,
0.404800	I have anxiety just being in medical buildings not because of the doctor herself. I also often feel worried when being examined that something wrong will be found.
0.714300	I am an anxious person anyway. Going to the Dr is a very persol matter, which makes me nervous. You do not know what to expect.
0.238100	Nothing in particular.  I'm pretty much comfortable there.  Nothing has ever happened that I would be terribly anxious.  I think a certain degree of anxiety is normal if you are sick and going to the doctor.  I think the anxiety is more related to the illness or symptoms than seeing the doctor.
0.547600	I guess I worry first because it's full of sick people and the energy is negative. Anxiety about the future is also a general condition existent in all and a doctor's office is a good symbol for that. No one knows what the shadow knows.
0.214300	Probably the bill.
0.595200	Occasiolly, I may feel anxious at a doctor's office because I have a fear of needles. I always have to lie down when I need them to take a sample of my blood. I also become anxious because if I am unsure about a medicine or pill I haven't taken before, I am worried about the possible side effects.
0.452400	I always dread what the doctor will find out, like if I have some horrible illness. I also feel like he talks at me rather than to me. This worries me because I don't feel that I'm a part of my healing program. 
0.142900	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting for the doctor is when he asks me very private information. I understand why since they are related to my health, but as a private person, it still makes me anxious/worried since I prefer those information to stay in my brain.
0.666700	Not knowing what's wrong with me.  Worrying that it's worse than it actually is.  The fear of not knowing whether or not they are able to help me.
0.619000	I am not a people person.  Even though I like my doctor, any time I have one-on-one with people that I do not deal with socially, I am uncomfortable to some degree.  I recognize this, and know that my doctor is there to help, but I am still anxious.  The waiting does not help.
0.404800	When they are in a bad mood. They have a facial expression of someone angry and mad at the world.
0.238100	"When visiting the doctor, there's always a ""what if"".  I'm never scared or worried about my health, per se, but just if something is not feeling right or beginning to come on."
0.642900	The main reason is that I am almost always anxious, especially when around other people, that is something in fact that I would probably be visiting the doctor for.  Other reasons would be just worrying if something may be wrong.  Most of it is due to the fact that I have an anxiety problem and it doesn't really take anything to make me that way.
0.642900	I guess worried that the Doctor may find something wrong or more serious than I thought. The uncertainty of going to a doctors office brings about a tension and I know that elevates my blood pressure. Some times a problem might be embarrassing to talk about and that brings about a feeling of anxiety as well.
0.142900	I am only anxious if something might not be covered by my health insurance plan. My biggest worry is money.
0.619000	I dont like waiting. Then I worry that they might find something wrong with me.
0.595200	No one ever wants to hear bad news about their health and when you don't see a physician often, it's likely that there may be underlying issues you are not aware of.
0.142900	I don't usually feel worried or anxious when I go, I live a fairly healthy life and I feel healthy. On the rare occasions where I do feel anxious is when I hurt myself working out. I've sprained my ankle badly before and I felt anxiety cause I didn't know if I broke a bone or something more severe. So the anxiety stems from not knowing the severity of my injuries.
0.738100	Waiting for test results.
0.642900	I sometimes feel somewhat anxious or worried about my general health profile and whether or how much my health might be declining or how much I might be developing risk factors for future problems.
0.523800	I get worried I won't have the time to ask everything I need,  or that I put it off too long. 
0.309500	Just that I would rather be somewhere else.  I am usually OK, but there is always that thought that they might find something.  But then again, that is a good thing because then we can treat it.
0.333300	Contracting something from other sick people, or feeling vulnerable just being in the office when I don't really want to be there.
0.690500	I don't like being poked and prodded while wearing a paper gown.
0.285700	there's the inevitable 'you need to be taking a statin' but that doesn't bother me much.  I know its coming, I know she's doing it because thats what the establishment teaches her to do.  my understanding of the issue, based on recent research, tells me different and the establishment it just lagging.
0.761900	Even though my overall health is good, I always worry when I go to the doctor that she is going to find something wrong with me. This is not based on any real evidence or health concerns, but I still worry about it quite a bit.
0.166700	Just the uncertainty of which tests I have to undergo and what shots are going to be given to me.
0.428600	"I get anxious about how the doctor will treat me and whether they will take me seriously.  I'm usually more worried about the doctor dismissing me than I am about them finding a serious health problem.  I also worry about the inevitable ""you're fat"" lecture.  I know it matters, but it still makes me feel bad."
0.547600	The thought of having your blood drawn makes me cringe.
0.571400	I am anxious about what the doctor might find about my health.  Even though I am a healthy individual, there are always some uncertainties.  I just anxious about what he might find even though I believe he will find nothing.
0.285700	I haven't felt anxious or worried about visiting a doctor's office since I was a small child. I don't really enjoy sitting nude with nothing but a paper shirt on, but it doesn't make me anxious or worried. 
0.452400	I worry about nearly everything, but that is one thing that I oddly don't general worry about.  I would say the only thing I might be slightly anxious about would be to find out I have something I didn't realize (tumor, heart condition, cancer), but that seldom crosses my mind.
0.285700	I am anxious just because I do not want to get a bunch of drugs to take that are bad for me.
0.142900	"Nothing. I don't worry or get anxious. Worry is a waste of time. Mark Twain said ""I have worried about a lot of things in my life, and some of them actually happened.""  People need to relax. If anything, maybe the bill would worry me, or that a treatment needed would be way too expensive to get. "
0.142900	the results of whats wrong with me 
0.738100	Not having a proper conversation that may get to a root.
0.928600	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me!  I do not like them trying to talk me into testing that I do not want.  I used to fuss about my weight and my blood pressure.
0.666700	The uncertainty of what may be found during the visit
0.476200	I'm not worried as much about the examition as I am about finding that there is something wrong with me. I always worry that I will have a bad disease or contract something that could be bad, even fatal for me.
0.333300	I might be worried something might be found that might be bad but I try to be optimistic and pray.
0.452400	My weight always makes me feel anxious and discouraged. Discussion around how much medication will cost makes me anxious. The wait in the waiting room usually makes me feel worried and irritated.
0.666700	I am a bit uncomfortable being social in general outside of people I know very well, so I'm usually more worried I am going to make a fool of myself. I also worry that the doctor will be disappointed with the ways I have been handling myself, even though I've never been treated harshly for such a thing. Filly, there is always the small worry of finding out about a debilitating condition that might change my life.
0.714300	It's just the uncertainty. I don't know what they're going to do or say and I don't necessarily trust that they'll make the right decision. As such I just feel a general nervousness and uncertainty when going in.
0.571400	"I am always worries about getting ""grim news"" about a symptom I go see my doctor about.  I know being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness is rare, but I always feel I will be one of the unlucky ones who gets that bad news."
0.547600	I don't like attention being on me. I always feel anxious when being seen for myself (and not my kids) and being examined. I would prefer to just skip over all of it!
0.142900	Getting weighed 
0.261900	That the examition/treatment might be painful (such as the time when I had an ingrown toeil remedied).
0.642900	I worry about what could be wrong with me.  It's not the doctor that makes me nervous. It's dealing with sickness.
0.690500	I feel most anxious or worried when it comes to what the doctor might tell me is wrong with me. When I am waiting to see the doctor, my mind starts to race with negative thoughts. While I understand the doctor is there to help, I would usually not be seeing the doctor at all if there was nothing wrong with me.
0.238100	I don't feel anxious about the visit. I have lived a healthy lifestyle. I don't expect bad news.
0.785700	how to describe what's going on with me so that I can get real help, not just lip service.  
0.690500	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something seriously wrong.  I worry that someday he will discover that I have a serious health condition.  As I get older these concerns are slowly increasing.
0.547600	I get scared that they're going to tell me something is really wrong, even though I have no reason to think that.
0.261900	Hearing news that is not good.
0.809500	I have medical PTSD from a very bad experience with an ambulance and hospital. Anything medical worries me. The nurse, in particular, is rude and has no business being in health care. She has mocked my mental health and has gotten away with it. I am afraid of actually telling them how I feel because of this. 
0.547600	With many problems due to a gastric bypass and anemia, I get worried when I have stomach issues or symptoms related to anemia so when I go to Dr. I think the worst in those cases.
0.809500	Getting wrong advice because I don't fully understand medical language.
0.785700	What makes me feel most anxious or worried about going to see a doctor is that I'm very nervous to tell someone my problems because they might not understand or they might judge me. 
0.261900	As I get older I worry a little bit each time that I could have some disease that people tend to get as they get older but it hasn't happened yet.
0.285700	I only feel anxious if I feel like the doctor has something to tell me but aren't being straight with me. 
0.738100	Bad news. That is all that needs to be said. There may be things that are wrong with you and you may find out on that visit. You could have cancer, you could have lupus- there are thousands of potential scerios that will start to unfold after that visit and its only human to be scared of those potential outcomes.
0.547600	I am always a little worried that something is wrong with me, and I didn't know it. I also get worried that the doctor will be judgmental of my life, like if I gained some weight or had drinks over the weekend. 
0.833300	I know that they are there to make money.  I don't want to be another product along the factory line.
0.976200	I had GAD, so even small issues cause my anxiety to kick into overdrive.
0.142900	Nothing, it doesn't make me anxious to go to the doctor.
0.523800	I feel most anxious when I know that I will have to undergo some kind of testing. Sometimes I worry about receiving negative results, or the doctor finding something unexpected. I worry that I might have an illness that could possibly be debilitating or even life-threatening.
0.476200	Fear of the unknown. Afraid of receiving a diagnosis that is far worse than something I have previously suspected.
0.428600	If the doctor will find anything that is seriously wrong with me out of nowhere.
0.785700	I am worried something is wrong with me, or what other tests and labs or procedures might be recommended. I also worry about money. Sometimes I worry that I am not explaining my issues correctly, or that my doctor is not considering all angles of my care, even though I know he tries. 
0.142900	I feel worried that I there should not be any major or serious issue with my health and I can should get complete relief after visiting the physician.
0.428600	The feeling of the unknown is probably what makes me the most anxious.  I try not to think too hard about it, but there is always a possibility of getting bad news when anyone is visiting the doctor.  
0.833300	I just don't usually trust people in general that easily. I also hate that I feel like there job is to judge my everything I do. I feel like many doctors don't follow their own advice which makes them hypocritical. 
0.547600	I just don't like al the poking and prodding, and the overly eager attitude to just prescribe medication for every little thing.
0.642900	I get most anxious about being diagnosed with something else, haha. The doctor doesn't make me nervous, just the whole idea of potentially having another thing wrong with me.
0.928600	Just the uncertainty of it all. Not knowing if what's wrong with me is serious or mind running away with it all. Thankfully almost every time I thought there was something serious wrong with me it turned out to be nothing. But I have bad anxiety and a panic disorder so it's the worry and not knowing that makes it hard for me to deal with. Once I leave there though I usually feel fine and relieved.
0.761900	The thing that makes me the most worried when visiting the doctor is the unknown.  That I will find out some dreaded news that I did not know before. 
0.142900	Just making sure I am doing what is right for my body, keeping my blood pressure in check and following my heart meds as expected.  I sometimes worry that my benign condition will suddenly become something to worry about.
0.500000	Generally, I'm not worried, unless I'm in pain from a specific problem.  Then, of course, I'm concerned about finding a solution for the pain.
0.857100	I am anxious about all of the things they check regularly because these things are likely to have some result or they would not check for them in the first place. 
0.142900	I don't have any anxious feelings. I've know this doctor for many years and he is a nice person as well as a good doctor.
0.285700	I have not had to go to the doctor's office the last few years so I do not recall, I guess it would be when I see needles, though the nice nurses tend to make the anxiety go away
0.285700	I am worried that my blood pressure will be high or my weight will be high because i haven't done what she told me to do and I haven't been following the diet that I agreed to follow. I am also worried about finding something else wrong with me. 
0.761900	I'm anxious because I don't know what is wrong with me and I don't have any confidence in finding a solution. Mostly, I just go to get relief from whatever is ailing me but I don't expect to be healed.
0.595200	If I go to the doctor's office, it's because I already know that something is wrong.  I'm in tune with my body and only go to the doctor's when absolutely necessary.  So, I get anxious if I can't tell what's wrong with me and worried about the diagnosis; some people in my family died fairly young.
0.452400	Just the uncertainty of the experience. Not knowing if the doctor is going to discover that something is wrong.
0.690500	My doctor seems reluctant to prescribe me certain medications, and it makes me think that he views me as someone who is drug seeking.
0.714300	I am always most anxious about my weight.  I continually try to lose weight, but am much heavier than I would like to be.
0.595200	When I go to the doctor, I find myself far more concerned with the costs associated with being there than I am with my actual health. I feel like I constantly have to decided between taking care of my health and mainting fincial security. Knowing that medical procedures can be very expensive causes me serious anxiety and stress.
0.285700	I don't want to hear any bad news, so it is a little worrisome to have an examition by a doctor. However, if it is a problem which is rather simple like a cold or the flu, then I'm not too worried about those situations.
0.881000	I worry because I have bad habits. I know he' going to tell me things I don't want to hear.
0.476200	The only thing that typically makes me nervous is the doctor finding something that concerns him that I had not recognized in myself.  The fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness, even though i'm not having any symptoms, is really what makes me anxious.
0.571400	That the doctor is going to find or determine that I have an issue or condition I was uware of or not expecting.
0.619000	The thing that makes me most anxious is probably the possibility of having some horrible disease. For all I know, I could go in for a checkup feeling fine and walk out knowing that I have cancer. At the same time I get kind of worried about the doctor misdiagnosing me or missing something important.
0.928600	I have a lifelong phoboa of doctors/hospitals, etc. Big time. Comes from a near death when I was three. Ratiolly/intellectually I know it is safe and good and helpful, but my body and mind go FEAR to the enth power. I even sweat walking by an ambulance. Have tried everything and can't undo it. 
0.666700	The one thing that makes me anxious is not knowing if there may be some things or issues I might have that I am not aware of. 
0.571400	What makes me anxious or worried is the uncertainty of not knowing what might be causing me to feel unwell. Whether is it something serious or minor.
0.333300	I tend to feel anxious because I really don't like getting exams. I feel worried because I tend to feel like something will be found even if I am a healthy person.
0.261900	I guess it is the fear of not knowing.
0.619000	The most anxious part is the waiting, whether it is in the waiting room or inside one of the examition rooms. It is the time where I think about what's going to happen, what the doctor might say, and the necessary questions I need to ask. Since I don't know all of this ahead of time, I'm trying to think of questions for any scerio, which is stressful. 
0.833300	May receive news/diagnosis that you do not want to hear
0.666700	I just get myself worked up for no good reason. I hate going there, even though I have never had a horrible experience. I guess I don't like other people poking, prodding, and seeing me ked. I am the same way about going to the dentist or giving blood.
0.142900	I'm in good health so I am never nervous about seeing my doctor. I go once a year for a check-up. The only thing that bothers me is the blood draw that he orders each time, this is needed to monitor my PSA because of a previous cancer diagnosis.  I also don't care much for the colonoscopy I must endure every three years.
0.666700	I wonder whether I am going to have wait a long time. I also wonder whether something is going to be wrong with me. 
0.833300	I always feel like I may be getting judged and also wondering about the outcome. 
0.738100	Im always worried that there may be something more serious wrong with me than what I think there is. It always makes me paranoid that I will find out something negative.
0.571400	If they will find anything wrong 
0.428600	I'm generally worried about my condition. Or the news they'll give me. Or some intrusive test.
0.476200	When I go because I do not feel well it makes me anxious that they will not find anything wrong and I will continue to suffer because they cant figure out whats wrong.
0.666700	i worry about getting weighed when i go to the doctor. i don't want to gain a few pounds and the doctor say something to me about it. i also worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me and then i'll have to deal with a tough situation. another thing i worry about is sweating. i get nervous about seeing the doctor for whatever reason and i get sweaty. that's kind of embarrassing.
0.452400	I have had a serious condition in the past. It's not the doctor it's what she might find.
0.714300	The only thing that would make me feel worried was if I was really sick or though that a really bad diagnosis was on it's way.   Not knowing what is wrong is the main worry that I would have.
0.785700	Nothing in particular about visiting the doctor, except for the last one I visited. (I tend to be a bit high strung or anxious, anyway; I have chronic clinical depression.)
0.571400	I always get uneasy when a doctor is feeling around my body. I'm always waiting for a bad response, like a lump or something that shouldn't be there.
0.833300	Just the nervousness of being there. I don't like visiting and you always worry a bit that something may really be wrong. 
0.833300	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor will start telling me that some of my symptoms are all in my head or that the doctor will decide that he wants to try some new treatment.  I am very drug sensitive and don't do well when I have to take a new drug.  I have had way too many bad reactions to medications, so now I have anxiety over any new medication I try.
0.881000	I have a really bad anxiety disorder that makes it hard to cope with that situation. Also, if a new nurse is involved who doesn't know me well, it is hard to cope with. 
0.928600	"I worry that I'm going to find out the treatment for whatever is wrong with me is going to be uvailable to me due to cost. Also I hate the general ""invasion of privacy"" feeling that it causes, particularly if I happen not to be alone when I am visiting the doctor."
0.738100	basically i feel uneasy because it's a sense of what is gon be wrong this time? i also in the back of my mind wonder if i will be mis diagnosed based on previous bad experience of filly getting wrist surgery 8 months too late
0.309500	I am most anxious about screenings for diseases such as cancer and heart because there's always an element of doubt on how the results will be and if I would require further tests. 
0.285700	I only feel anxious or worried if I suspect something's wrong with me. Otherwise I'm always pretty relaxed in the doctor's office, and pretty comfortable with the nurses and staff in general.
0.381000	I get anxious about being weighed, about what my blood pressure will be and about getting ked.
0.190500	I have HIV so I am always worried that my medications may stop working or if I am starting a new treatment that it may not be as useful as my prior regime.
0.666700	Doctors finding tumors.
0.500000	When I first started going to him it had been quite a while since I have had a primary doctor. I was very anxious about my test results. I had 2 serious issues. The first one is completely under control now. We are working on the second. This had decreased my anxiety. I guess my anxiety stems from not knowing about any issues I have.
0.785700	Well when its a cold or the flu it isn't that bad. It's when you don't know what illness you have that's really scary. When you have this unexplained pain that doesn't go away and you mistakenly look on the internet for answers towards what it may be. Even without the internet, sitting there with pain in an area that could have a serious illness like cancer, waiting for the doctor to come back with his diagnoses would make anyone anxious. Simply, people fear hearing the possibility of bad news, no matter how big or small. 
0.214300	Because at home my blood pressure is good but as soon as the doctor comes in to take it, it goes up
0.142900	the only thing i worry about is when i have to get a shot. i hate needles.
0.690500	I worry about the communication aspect of a doctor's visit. I know that I will not ask the questions that I should ask and may not remember the information they have told me.
0.285700	That I might find out something new I have to deal with, when I really don't have the time or patience for more medical drama. 
0.238100	Anything that requires a time-delay worries me: bloodwork, urine alysis, etc. The lab can take a while and my mind always wanders to the worst that could happen. 
1.000000	I feel the most anxious or worried about finding out there may be something seriously medically wrong with me. I usually don't feel super worried if I go in for sinus infection symptoms, or something routine. Last time I went, it was for a breast lump, and I was terrified. 
0.642900	Always worried that something I can't fix will go wrong. I'm like that with everything not just medical problems. Bring my car to the mechanic and wait anxiously until I get the diagnosis. Same is true of my health. I'm sick I go in to find out what's wrong but going to be anxious until i get the all clear.
0.833300	Are they going to see my scars and ask me about them? What if they call the police on me and have me committed against my will?
0.642900	Mostly my weight. It has been an issue due to some of the medications I am on. I worry that I have gained weight each time I visit and that my doctor will comment on it. I also worry about the blood test results I have done each month and hope that they reflect that the medications I am on are working so I don't have to change medications yet again.
0.381000	It makes me feel most anxious or worried when the doctor wants to do numerous tests without explaining why those tests are necessary.
0.761900	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is that I do not know what to expect each time with my persol health and hoping that nothing is going to come up as wrong or a health issue. I also get anxious about just sitting in the waiting room and wondering what will happen when I get called into the office. 
0.142900	What makes me anxious and worried is that they do not listen to what I want or trying to do things a tural way. They just blindly follow protocol and make money for big pharma. Free healthcare is one thing but It would be so much better if we could afford decent rent and space to take care of our well being instead of expensive rent, small spaces and cheap food so that we are stressed and unhealthy. 
0.333300	I am mostly worried about long waits. I am sometimes worried about a possible diagnosis.I am sometime worried bout the doctor's mood.
0.547600	I have more of an untural fear of doctors and dentists. This is most likely due to the fact that I so seldom need to see a doctor. If I had been unhealthy and seen a lot of doctors, I suspect I would be way more comfortable with the process. But I assume it's much better to be healthy and see a doctor seldom and to be sick and see a doctor so often as to not be uncomfortable.  :)
0.952400	I don't like the atmosphere of doctors offices. I don't like feeling like just another number coming through. I don't feel like I'm being heard or cared about when I am visiting the doctor. 
0.500000	if it is a follow up for something unknown
0.809500	I just hate going there I've always been that way. It's kind of hard to explain. The doctor isn't a big deal but the nurses and assistants are different all the time and do different things like look at different things I don't think really matters. Then there expressions change and they say nothing so this makes me anxious. So pretty much the whole thing I hate, I'm just always happy to get out of there.
0.571400	Will I remember to tell them all the necessary information.
0.285700	I don't like having blood drawn. This is the only part of my doctor visits that I don't like. 
0.214300	I only get anxious/worried if I think I could have a serious health problem - and the doctor is giving me feedback on it. It is typically something I am familiar with so I am not that worried.
0.714300	That they will give me bad news, and that the treatment will be something I'm uncomfortable with. 
0.619000	I just don't like going. It smacks of weakness and it invades my privacy. It's also time consuming and expensive.
0.523800	The possibility of learning some potentially life changing information.  Also the discomfort of some of the procedures. 
0.571400	You never know what is wrong, I get nervous going to the dr with a  complaint not knowing what it is.
0.619000	I guess there's always the back-of-the-mind fear that the doctor will find something wrong. That's not usually a huge concern for me, though, because I've always been quite healthy aside from my weight, which I'm working on. Mostly I'm just anxious because there's nearly always SOMETHING uncomfortable in a doctor's visit. Taking off more clothes than I'd like to, or painful examitions (and I have a VERY low pain threshold - I consider those blood pressure cuffs painful), or being told yet again that I'm overweight as if I couldn't see that for myself.
0.357100	Just the waiting process makes me nervous because I just want to get it over with. Usually, doctors visits have been pleasant but I just want to get them over with so I can continue my day. If I sit in the office waiting for a long time, I start getting stressed over the potential wait in regards to whatever I have planned after, and it just makes me nervous overall waiting.
0.714300	Not knowing what will happen
0.666700	"I am always worried I am going to get a ""death sentence"".  I also worried that the procedure will hurt.  I also worry that the doctor will tell me something that I should be doing, because what I am doing is not good enough."
0.476200	When I have a gynecological or sensitive problem that I feel embarrassed about. I'm getting to be less worried about that but especially when I was young that was a main area of discomfort.
0.738100	If I visit a doctor's office, I'm worried about several things. I worry that something is wrong with me and it's going to be worse than I imagined. I also worry that I will be misdiagnosed, and I also worry about what the doctor or his nurses think of me, particularly if I have to disrobe during the examition.
0.619000	im scared what they are going to tell me about my condition and the  office just makes me uneasy, it is not like im going there for a good reason.
0.238100	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I can never be completely sure what diagnosis I am going to get. It would be silly to say I wasn't worried or anxious that I could get some negative news regarding my health.
0.309500	Even though I'm comfortable at my doctors office and have known him for years, I always get a little anxious when going in for an exam. I think it's mostly because I'm worried about what they'll find that's wrong. Most of the time it's only something minor or nothing at all, but I still get a little worried.
0.738100	Mostly just the fact the person is usually someone I haven't met before because I do not have a stable family doctor, and also the cost. 
0.214300	I will be worried if they will told me to undergo medication because I will need money in order to that.  I hate expenses.
0.476200	When we're no longer young we are always fearful of a Dr finding some health problem that we may be uware of but I'm in extremely good health so I'm not really anxious when I see my PCP. I'm more anxious about my insurance company denying payment for something or the government (congress) screwing up insurance and chasing sll the Drs out of the profession.
0.142900	If I am worried about what I'm there for, then I'm worried.  For example, I had a lump that needed to be examined. My doctor was not concerned, but because of my level of concern, had no problem referring me for further diagnostics to help ease my mind.  Waiting for the results was the anxious part, but because my doctor was not concerned at all, it helped ease the anxiety.
0.261900	Just the idea that even though everything feels and looks good, there's the possibility that something is wrong. The unknown is what makes me the most worried.
0.857100	I'm anxious about the doctor discovering something that's going to dramatically change my life. There's always the possibility that something dire might turn up.
0.500000	Just that I may have to switch medications or that something new will be discovered. That she will not be able to find or fix what is wrong. That she won't give me a recommendation if she feels it is not needed. 
0.619000	I tend to expect the worst so I often feel anxious about what the actual diagnosis will be. 
0.738100	I am worried about them finding something big wrong with me.  Something that would change my life drastically or something that cannot be fixed.
0.142900	I'm more worried about the cost than anything else. I'm very healthy, but I'm afraid of the high cost of falling ill and having any medical issue. That's what concerns me the most 
0.261900	Because instead of addressing the source of symptoms they usually just give you something to cover up the symptom while the underlying causes just get worse. And also because they are very time inefficient. I once had to sit in a room for an hour and a half with very excruciating pain just for the doctor to figure out my nose was broken, which i already knew but he didnt think so
0.857100	I feel anxious at the doctor because I never know what they will tell me. That alone worries me. What do I have to pay for next is the question in my head.
0.857100	The doctors always like to blame the patent for  everything.  They dont understand  that we  have a  real life out side  our health. I  cant make  it  to  6 doctors  in a  week and  still work enough to be able to pay for gas  to get to them doctors appointments  
0.285700	The anxious part is just the exams in general. I don't have great health insurance so if they find anything wrong I couldn't be able to afford it.
0.285700	In good general health. Not expecting any surprises. Mostly go for routine annual checkups.
0.547600	I worry that my blood pressure will be high again and that worry makes it worse.  I also worry that my disease will be out of remission and I will not be able to work.
0.714300	Obviously, that something is wrong. That you've gone in for something routine and there may be more going on than what you were prepared for. For example, going in for something that you thought was a swollen lymph node and being apprehensive that it could be cancer. I think about these sorts of things when I have an appointment. 
0.333300	What worries me is the possibility of the doctor finding something seriously wrong, like cancer. Other than that I don't really worry about doctor appointments.
0.666700	They will get me hooked on some medication that makes me worse and dependent on office visits. 
0.357100	The only thing that i usually dislike is getting my blood pressure taken. Not only have the PA's taken incorrect readings on many occasions, but , because i had hypertension in the past (since resolved) i still fear getting a high reading. Usually my heart rate elevates a bit while i'm getting it done. 
0.547600	I get worried if they can't figure out what is wrong relatively quickly. I would start to think it is something serious and potentially lose sleep over it. Luckily, I've only had that happen a few times, and in the end the problem was resolved.
0.381000	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is that something could possibly be wrong. Even if I go for a normal checkup and I do not have any signs of anything being wrong with me, just going to the doctor makes me slightly anxious because I know that if there is any bad results this is the place it will come from. 
0.142900	i dont. i am healthy and i have a healthy lifestyle
0.928600	I am afraid that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I am also afraid that the doctor will make a mistake or mis-prescribe me a wrong medication. I also feel that the doctors do not really listen when I tell them something. 
0.571400	I feel anxious when I require blood draws and I also get anxious sitting in the waiting room. I get worried that there could be something wrong when things progress so slowly during the appointments. 
0.285700	that my doctor is not well informed of my health needs prior to and during the visit
0.142900	There is nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. The doctor has always been patient with me, and very understanding. There's nothing that makes me feel out of place, and the doctor always explain what will happen ahead of time and the reason why.
0.476200	Wondering if something is wrong
0.381000	Just hearing her 'official' word on lab results, I'd say. I've normally already looked at the numbers thanks to an online portal where they post results, but I don't necessarily know what they mean and I don't generally feel like doing research (e.g. to see if a small change in my triglycerides is significant) when I know I'll see her within a week (lab work always a week before I see her, results usually online a few days prior to appointment with her). It's ever so slight. 
0.357100	I can't put a finger on it, but possibly hearing that I am doing poorly in some aspect of my health.  I try to be a healthy person, but it would be hard to hear that something is seriously wrong, and I guess that's where I become anxious.
0.142900	I don't get anxious at the doctor's office. If I have something wrong with me and they run tests then I might worry about the results, but otherwise I'm pretty calm.
0.595200	I feel nervousness in general, like maybe the doctor will find something that wasn't there before. I am worried they will lecture me about smoking cigarettes. And I am just anxious in general when I go out in public.
0.523800	The possibility that they could find something wrong with me.
0.809500	I am anxious because I can't predict my results. I am most scared of being told my health is in a poor state. Bad news could possibly come out and I wouldn't know what to do about it. 
0.642900	i have hypertension and when i go to the doctor, my bp is typically higher than outside the office. the thought of it going higher at the office makes it go higher at the office if you know what i mean. i also don't being weighed as i am currently overweight.
0.738100	I am worried there might be a problem I'm not aware of, especially high blood pressure or thyroid issues which run in my family. I also feel like the nurse and doctors at the practice I go to don't really listen to my concerns much. 
0.738100	My anxiety when visiting a doctor's office is pretty irratiol, but I can't deny that I feel it. It's largely because of the uncertainty of the experience. Even if I feel that I am in good health, it's possible that the doctor could tell me I am in poor health or have a condition I was uware of. Though knowing about the condition would be positive overall, it is a frightening thing. 
0.142900	nothing -I do get upset and tend to walk out if he she has not seen me within 30 minutes of my appointment
0.381000	I feel afraid that the doctor won't have enough time for me, or he'll brush off my questions. Those are my two biggest concerns when I go to the doctor. I don't like my opinion to be brushed off or disregarded, and I hate feeling as though my concerns don't matter. It also makes me really anxious that I wait 45 minutes to see a doctor and then the overall appointment takes only 90 seconds. It just makes me feel really worried that I'm not getting the care or attention that I should be. 
0.142900	I think what would make me feel most anxious would be if my doctor found something wrong with me
0.381000	I WAS FEELING WORRIED ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME OR IF MY CONDITION WAS IMPROVING. I GUESS I AM ALWAYS ANXIOUS ABOUT GETTING ON MORE MEDICATION THAN I WANT TO.
1.000000	Just that I don't go very often at all, and I'm not young. Sooner or later, they are going to find something wrong. I also don't like getting undressed for anyone. I have major self esteem issues, and as I said, I am a very nervous person. 
0.571400	Not knowing what is wrong with me and I get worried about if anything has gotten worse
0.547600	I always feel anxious and worried about what may be the outcome of whatever is going on.
0.142900	I really don't feel anxious or worried at all going to the doctor. I feel relieved that I am going to get better with her help. I guess a worry would always be finding out news that you may die soon, but I'm young so I really don't think about that.
0.881000	What makes me anxious is the possibility of having a serious condition. I know it's just a small chance of it, but just the possibility of that make me very nervous and scared. 
0.619000	I worry that the doctor will just brush off my concerns. I also worry because I have a history of cancer in my family.
0.714300	Ever since I found out I have a rare blood disease I feel a sense of dread and worry whenever I see the doctor.  It passes as soon as she tells me everything is okay, but up until that moment, I feel worried and nervous.
0.785700	A physical exam is generally unpleasant to me. I worry about what professiols might think about my body, or me in general. I also worry that something unexpected might show up and my health is declining.
0.309500	I usually have alot of visits to the doctor because of a few health issues i have. And always when i get examined i am anxious even thou i know i am okay i would always be anxious cause you never know how your body is going to change wether in a good way or bad.
0.976200	The fact that they make assumptions and don't listen to me. I've witnessed them giving incorrect information to other people and I'm always annoyed that they will do the same to me. So just based off of previous encounters, I dread that. 
0.333300	I tend to be anxious in general. I worry the doctor won't understand my concern, won't be able to help me or will choose not to.
0.214300	Obviousley, him finding out I'm sick. Him finding out something on me is broken. Or even him telling me I'm uble to reproduce. 
0.357100	Most of my anxiety comes from the doctor feeling that I need further testing beyond what is covered by my insurance. 
0.333300	The possibility of finding something I don't want hear.
0.571400	My doctor often tells me to quite smoking, but have not quite yet. I get worried that he is going to get mad at me for still smoking.
0.261900	Not knowing whether or not my condition is improving.  Sometimes, it's hard to tell without lab work, as I feel fine most of the time.  
0.285700	Not really much does.   I am a level headed person.  The only thing that would make me anxious is if I felt something was wrong, not with the care I actually receive.
0.142900	nothing makes me feel most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor's office... 
0.881000	I am worried that they will find something serious. Although I'd rather know than not know.
0.238100	Only if its about something new that could be something very bad, or just awaiting answers on previous tests. Otherwise im always fine.
0.238100	I have always been anxious when I go in for a physical , hoping the results be favorable
0.547600	I'm very overweight, and I worry about disappointing my doctor because I haven't lost any.
0.142900	Poor communication makes me wonder about the doctor.
0.523800	I worry that he might find something that I didn't know about.  Like some growth or cancer or something.  It's just the unknown and then what it might lead to. 
0.285700	I only sometimes experience slight anxiety. This comes from a general sense that there could be something wrong with my health.
0.809500	Now we cannot see the Dr.'s we trust. We have to see Dr.'s that are assigned to us. Usually, I am rushed through or disrespected. I don't go for this reason. I'll just die in my home. 
0.666700	You are always a bit on edge hoping that you won't find out you have a terrible illness. I feel like I don't know my doctor anymore so it's very impersol and makes you feel a bit awkward in telling someone so much about you. I also feel like there isn't enough time to be told things in detail.
0.952400	I have social anxiety. Going to see a doctor is like being asked to perform on broadway completely ked without ever having been given a script. You don't know what to expect. You feel like the doctor might be secretly judging you, and when it's all done you might find out that you are gon be dead in a month.
0.452400	I think I'm always just worried about what they are going to find out next. After all is said and done I feel all the anxiety is gone.
0.571400	I feel anxious because I know she is always going to find something wrong. If it isn't my thyroid it is something else. I am worried because she always wants to put me on that blood pressure medicine with a diuretic, which made me sick and pass out constantly last time. My doctor is a real piece of work. She doesn't think of the tural approach to things.
0.904800	I know that my specific concerns will likely not be addressed
0.238100	I REALLY DO NOT FEEL VERY ANXIOUS GOING TO THE DOCTOR UNLESS I GO THERE WITH SOME COMPLAINT. IN THAT CASE, I HAVE A SLIGHT WORRY THAT THE CONDITION MAY BE MORE SERIOUS, PERSISTENT, OR REQUIRE MORE ATTENTION THAN I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH. ALMOST ALL MY VISITS ARE FOR ROUTINE CHECK-UPS, AND I FEEL NO ANXIETY ABOUT THEM.
0.357100	Sometimes, I felt uncertain about my disease condition and related treatments when visiting the doctor's office. I was not sure if I should take a new medicine for my disease. 
0.881000	Blood work mostly, procedures that could go wrong, not really listening to me. The whole thing is a stressor.
0.809500	For me, it is the complete feeling of powerlessness. When I go to my doctor, I am both afraid of bad news, and no news. Bad news that will change my life, and also receiving no news at all, requiring me to repeat this same excruciating process in the near future. Good news is always the hope, but when I visit the Dr. I tend to look at things more pessimistically than I do in other aspects of my life.
0.476200	I'm anxious about what he might say I have and it's untreatable and that worries me a lot.
0.761900	Honestly, that they think I am exaderatting my symptoms - or that they will not know what to do and i go undigainosed or mis diagnosed because they are not allowed to perform the tests that they should be cause of cost
0.404800	I don't worry so much about getting a predictable diagnosis or treatment for a physical condition I have already noticed and/or need to have taken care of. What I worry about is whether the doctor will tell me it's worse than I thought or find something else wrong with me.
0.214300	As I get older, there is always the fear of what they might find - something that just pops up.
0.500000	I worry that the doctor may find something serious wrong with me, and I worry that he may prescribe tests or medications that will cost more money than I can afford to spend. I'm fairly healthy, so mostly I worry about the costs.
0.428600	because of my past history, my body is not how a normal healthy person my  age is. It seems like everytime I go to the drs. it seems like something else pops up
0.142900	Don't really feel worried. Just depends if its something major would make me feel worried. 
0.523800	I have had breast cancer and am now always ready for the shoe to drop when I am in to see her.
0.142900	The language barrier.
0.142900	The times that I have felt anxious has been when I didn't know what was wrong.  I had knee pain a few years ago after injuring it playing basketball.  I was nervous or anxious that I would find out after examining it that I would need major surgery.  It turned out to not be a big deal and I just needed to rest and rehab it, but it was a very anxiety inducing day for me. 
0.142900	The thought of having a newly discovered illness is what tends to worry me the most about visiting a doctor. I always have a fear when new tests are run the doctor may discover cancer or some other life-threatening illness.
0.238100	The fact that something else could be wrong with me. I usually like going to the doctors. So, not too   much stress.
0.714300	Not knowing if something may actually be wrong with my health
0.761900	I am a generally anxious and uneasy person. I takes a lot for me to trust someone on a persol level. Therefore, my visit's to the doctor tend to bring on anxiety and worry.
0.738100	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is going in there paying my co-pay and them not listen to me.  I do not go to the doctors if there really is not a problem.  I do not like going to the doctors.  So I get worried every time I go there because it is more than likely them not listening to my problems again.
0.142900	I might have to waste some time in the waiting room.  I prefer to spend my time as I choose to spend it.
0.571400	The unknown. Possibility that they will find something wrong with me that requires medical attention. 
0.452400	I feel these feelings sometimes because i do not always know what to expect from my doctor. I also dont know what they may find wrong with me if anything. It is always a nerve wrecking experience.
0.881000	I am anxious about what the doctor may say is wrong and that it may be something serious and my mind wanders in all kinds of directions . 
0.738100	What makes me most anxious is finding out the worst possible news in regards to the medical conditions I have had. I feel this way because I am a worse case scerio kind of person.  So I already have thoughts of what they might tell me.
0.500000	I hate going to pay a copay and then not get what I feel is the best option for me. It stresses me out to go and also I don't drive so getting there its not an easy task in general. So its just getting there and still having unresolved concern.
0.476200	Just sitting there, waiting for her to come in, thinking about how to tell her what has been going on with me (why I'm there to see her), about what she will find/diagnose.
0.785700	The exam itself especially from a gynecologist. I hate being nude even with a Dr I really like and trust. I feel exposed.
0.785700	I am worried that my doctor will do a seemingly common test that will indicate i have a life-threatening medical condition that i was completely oblivious to.
0.428600	I don't feel much anxiety when I'm at the doctor's office.
0.333300	I sometimes feel worried when visiting the doctors office because if I am there it's because I'm not feeling well.  But I feel regular checkups are a good thing to stay healthy.
0.285700	How seevere is my condition.Some doctors like to practice fear mongering.
0.214300	"I think there is a general anxiety when visiting a doctor or dentist's office. I feel more anxious when I am in the office because of a serious problem I am having. The anxiety is not caused by the doctor but rather by the possibility my ""ailment"" might turn out to be serious."
0.142900	For now, I don't feel that way because I trust my Doctor so much.Seems that he is my family or brother
0.428600	just the wait always makes me anxious. 
0.142900	That they will find something wrong/incurable. 
0.857100	"I feel the most anxious about the unknown.  Even totally healthy people can have bad things happen and I have not been living the healthiest lifestyle.  I worry that there will be something wrong with me that cannot be ""fixed."""
0.595200	It makes me feel worried that the doctor might discover a problem during the examition that I didn't know about.
0.142900	I do not feel worried about a visit.
0.452400	Since I have had numerous medical issues, I do have some anxiety or worry that something may be amiss when i discuss current symptoms or have to get certain blood work done.  I usually, however, keep things under control!
0.785700	I would feel out-of-control.  I would feel depersolized and treated as a body.  I would feel vulnerable.
0.714300	When I visit a Doctor's office, it is because I am already showing symptoms of something that has not gone away on its own. As a result, I am already worried prior to the visit, as if it doesn't go away on its own, it may be serious.
0.714300	I've had exams by very rude and impatient ER doctors before that made me feel less than human. 
0.452400	THat something will be wrong with me.
0.761900	I'm always worried that what they think is wrong with me is incorrect. I think that it is something worse than what it is.
0.952400	I do not like to be touched by people, so being examined is extremely stressful to me.  I am also a nervous person in general, so it does not take much to get me worked up.  I tend to be pessimistic, so it is easy for me to assume the worst about health conditions.  I (and members of my family) have been brushed off when we did bring up medical complaints, so I tend to worry whether the doctor will take my complaints seriously.     
0.238100	I am not sure why I might feel anxious or worried.  
0.857100	Going to the doctor's office makes me feel like I'm going to take a test I haven't studied for. I'm fearful of potential health defects but also of just being judged in general. I am aware on a logical level that this is silly but the feelings persist anyways.
0.404800	I persolly just dislike the actual procedures. I'm not fond of the actual process as I am a very private person.
0.809500	The possibility of health issues is always a concern. However, I am quite an anxious individual, so just the base process of attending this appointment fills me with an uneasiness and a sense of dread. I feel a lack of confidence and a sense of embarrassment, even seemingly without just cause.
0.357100	Cost of treatment Treating the pain or injury I have would cause me to stop doing something I like to do.
0.738100	I hate having to slightly disrobe for something that is no fun at all! If the doctor looked like Brad Pitt, then I would be happy to go. 
0.761900	That they will discover I have some horrible illness or that I will need some awful treatment. I also just dislike the environment (cold, reeking of disinfectant).
0.523800	Asking everything I want to.  Not forgetting something.  Trying not to be too much of an annoyance.
0.404800	Its the whole scene of making the trip their, sitting in the waiting room, surrounded by strangers and their aliments with my my thoughts that drift off to cooler place I wish to be. 
0.285700	Uncertainty about my illness, or the treatment I may need.
0.238100	its usally a long wait when I go to the doctors the waiting makes me anxious and when I have to wait to get results makes me feel worried some times.
0.142900	I have a condition that is called white coat syndrome. When I go to the doctor even though I do not feel different my bp rises. After I settle down I come out normal. I do sometime feel a little bit nervous when getting back blood tests but other than that I look forward to seeing my doctor. 
0.428600	that he might lie to me in order to make me feel better
0.881000	I feel most nervous that they are going to tell me about something that will kill me that I was uware of. 
0.142900	This depends highly on the current health situation. If I had a serious health issue, I'm sure I would feel some anxiety about the diagnosis and treatment. Maybe more so about the costs than anything else. 
0.785700	I worry that I won't be taken seriously. I worry that I won't be able to get what I need. I feel anxious about experiencing prejudice (many healthcare professiols have prejudice against fat patients and transgender patients). I worry about the results of lab tests. 
0.428600	I guess whether or not something will be wrong with me that I'm not aware of. I don't normally think like this though. 
0.547600	"I feel most anxious about the ""what ifs"". What if something were wrong, or something was gong to happen medically. I often get anxious about my interactions with a professiol, I am not a ""people"" person."
0.666700	What makes me most worried when visiting the doctor is learning that I have an illness or other negative condition that was preventable. Next is learning about an illness or condition that is neither treatable nor preventable.
0.381000	Honestly the most anxious I get is over getting shots. I know they're important but they trigger a phobia in me and it makes me very uneasy to deal with it. 
0.404800	I always worry that they will look at my former diagnosis and decide or judge me verses taking a look at whats bothering me at the time. for instance, I was self medicating with alcohol, i came in drunk several times, so when i get asked several times if im still drinking in the same visit, its irritating. Are you sure you havent drank this week? its patronizing. 
0.166700	That I will be embarrassed, and also I worry about the result they will give me.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, is the possibility that he finds something abnormal during the check up.
0.452400	I worry if the doctor may be right in the diagnosis and I worry that the doctor would prescribe a medication that would eventually harm me in the long term. I feel that the doctor only concern about making her quota for the day and would not give me the full attention i require.
0.690500	i always seem to get bad news. i hate being told or wondering if i am doing things right. everything seem so cold and sterile.
0.666700	I'm most anxious when waiting around. If there are test results in limbo, etc. My general experience is relief when I take care of whatever issues are at play.
0.357100	Mostly just that the doctor is going to find something really bad.  I am not worried about what the doctor will do or the physical examition itself.  Just the part in the back of your mind that he may diagnose something very bad.  That is what makes me worried and a little uneasy.  Not a whole lot just in the back of my mind.
0.619000	I've had so many health problems in the last 10 years that a visit to the Dr. is almost never good news.
0.928600	That my knowledge of my body and my views about medicine and disease will not be respected. That I will be forced into treatments that run counter to my beliefs. That I will be abused and put through unnecessary procedures or tests.
0.738100	I'm more worried they might find something bad that I wasn't aware of. This is more me worrying than anything as it's rare they find anything serious. Most of the time the problem isn't serious and they can treat it. I just kinda hold my breath when I'm at the doctor anyway, you never know if they'll find something you don't know about....
0.142900	I feel most anxious about anomalies showing up in my blood tests and the embarrassment of getting a pap smear.  But in general, I do not get anxious or worried when seeing a doctor.  I see doctor visits as a necessity, and any medical problems must be detected and dealt with head-on.
0.738100	In all honesty, what makes me the most anxious is walking into the doctors office and sitting there alone waiting for my doctor to come. There is nothing more that puts me on edge like that.
0.642900	I'm just a very anxious person in general, and I have white coat syndrome, so my blood pressure rises when I go to the doctor, which in turn makes the doctors/nurses worried, which makes my anxiety increase. I also get anxious that the doctor will find something wrong with me, which will have a negative impact on my life.
0.642900	If the doctors says unpredictable things or some thing bad it scare me to see the doctor.
0.452400	I mainly worry when I am not certain about what is going on with my body. What is causing issues of illness.
0.166700	Just the out-of-routine occurance. A visit to the doctor is not a normal daily occurance for me.
0.642900	whether i will get the best solution for me
0.690500	I am most anxious about finding a reason and remedy for any health problems. I become worried about invasive and expensive testing that give no answers. I worry about being overlooked or ignored about my concerns.
0.476200	Wondering what battery of tests or measures may be necessary, whether something unplanned or unnounced will be painful or stressful.
0.642900	Can they be trusted?
0.595200	Just doctor's in general make me nervous no matter how many times I have been. I think they call it white coat syndrome. I am fearful of a scary diagnosis even tho I have never had one before. 
0.595200	Waiting for news. 
0.357100	It depends on the circumstances. I not usually anxious or worried at all about a routine examition. If I'm there because I'm injured or ill, I might be somewhat worried about my condition or the prognosis.
0.571400	I do not have to visit the doctor often enough to have worry.
0.785700	I'm not sure there's anything specific. The whole visit is overwhelming. I'm nervous I won't get to tell them what's wrong. That they will be rushing and not listening to you. If you go for a physical and tell them things that have been wrong with you, you have to worry about insurance because it's no longer a physical. You worry about them overbilling because if you aren't requesting an itemized bill, you know they are.
0.381000	I only worry if I think something is wrong. I visit my doctor to decrease my worry.
0.595200	I'm afraid they will tell me something bad. 
0.976200	The uncertainty of the potential outcome is what worries me most.  That uncertainty stems from a fear that something may be terribly wrong with me. Along with that, there's always the fear that either way, I'm going to have to undergo frightening procedures that may include getting needles (I have a phobia of them).
0.619000	I think the biggest thing is that I always think the worst and assume I will get bad news a lot of times. It takes a lot for me to go to the doctor usually so when I do go I get nervous and anxious. 
0.476200	I feel anxious at time of visitation because I feel sometimes they will give me some negative results about my health.  
0.714300	I am always a little worried that they are going to find something seriously wrong with me. The only doctors I have been to in the past few years are baby doctors and they are typically very good at relieving those worries.
0.714300	i hate to go to clinic  the atmosphere makes me sick more
0.666700	I do not visit the doctor's office often but when I do I always automatically get an un-easy feeling of nervousness. I can not explain why I feel this way.
0.142900	My health is what worries me. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong. New doctors also make me a little anxious.
0.642900	I am not an anxious or worrisome person, but I do often feel these emotions in a doctor's office. Sometimes I worry that my condition may be worse than I am assuming. Also, I guess as a gut feeling, I just don't like doctor's offices, which helps to invoke these emotions.
0.809500	Cost is always a big factor and then you worry about what they may find and what treatments and/or prescriptions that you will have to take and what side effects could be included. 
0.666700	Just being in a doctor's office makes me anxious. You know you are there because you're not feeling well, but you don't know the exact reason why and you never know what you might be diagnosed with. You also never know if the doctor is going to reprimand you about the way that you handle your health and that can be embarrassing and upsetting. I am a relatively private person and I hate putting myself so out there and that includes telling the doctor private health information.
0.500000	When I have to get on a scale. I hate getting on a scale...period. I'm not morbidly obese or anything, but it makes me very anxious. I wish people didn't insist on weighing  people everywhere. 
0.476200	I always believe something is wrong when they don't just tell fast. I feel that they are annoyed someone came to get better.
0.785700	My family on both my mother's and father's, have histories of terrible diseases as well as cancer. My dad died of cancer at a young age. There is also quite a bit of mental health issues, the cause of my mother's suicide. I've spent a lot of time in hospitals watching people die and just driving by a hospital gives me the chills. I worry because I always expect the worst when it comes to doctor visits.
0.285700	I don't know. Nothing really. If I have a concern that I think something is really bad, I would probably be nervous. If I had no idea what was going on with my health.
0.547600	I think it is usually the possibility of illness or a bad visit and finding out something is wrong.
0.285700	NOT APPLICABLE
0.285700	I do not typically get worried when going to the Dr. Unless it is going to be a painful procedure.
0.642900	I would feel most anxious while visiting the doctor's office because I would fear that there was something else wrong with me instead of what I was going in for.
0.142900	I worry about what my blood pressure will be that is basically all that I worry about them doing
0.523800	"Really, the only thing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the potential for unknowns. While my health may not be the best, I have never encountered anything ""serious"" when seeing my doctor. I am always somewhat concerned that he may one day find something that requires serious medical attention, and that worries me."
0.595200	I get most upset and worried when it comes to physical examitions because of my own persol views about myself and my body.
0.142900	I feel most worried that the doctor will find something, maybe it's cancer, or some other neurological disease. But even though logically, I shouldn't worry, it just becomes automatic. 
0.190500	"Mostly it's finding out something is wrong. Other than that, it's more of ""did I cut my ils, or wash well"", and making sure I don't smell. The exam is just ""there"", and doesn't cause me too much worry."
0.214300	just the thourht of the unknown like getting bad news but not usully that bad of and experience as far as worrying goes
0.571400	There is nothing in particular, it is just a generalized anxiety I get just by going to the doctor. It is just an uneasiness that I get just being there. 
0.809500	I am always worried about bad news. My mind always goes to thinking that any results will come back bad. I also fear being told I will have to come back for more testing.
0.571400	Because of how people can't do things with how the doctor's office and the results
0.523800	Uncomfortable questions. And also the dread that he will find something wrong with me. 
0.238100	I not the type of person who gets anxious or worries about anything. If i felt anything it would be uncertainty about finding out about some condition I wasn't aware of.
0.381000	I would say the only thing that really makes me worried is the chance that my doctor will have some bad news for me after a checkup. Something like cancer or another terrible disease.   
0.333300	The only thing that makes me nervous is when they take blood because I hate needles.  I also have in the back of my mind the notion that the blood might come back with something negative that might negatively affect my life.
0.142900	Having to do an unexpected procedure that either is somewhat painful or time consuming. Having to wait to see the doctor. 
0.714300	I don't like to have my body examined, as I feel a little uncomfortable with it. Also I am always worried he might find something seriously wrong with my health. 
0.571400	I don't really feel anxious when I visit my main doctor (as described previously), but I've had a certain amount of doctor phobia as long as I can remember/since I was a small child.  I'm really irratiolly afraid of needles and especially injections.  I am capable of having blood drawn if I lay down, but I have a feeling there's part of me that always expects at a GP's place or something that they're going to want to give me a shot or something...  I know that won't happen at the endocrinologist's office, ha
0.428600	I am most anxious about the doctor not knowing what the issue is.  I am anxious about anything requiring surgery.  I am fearful of debilitation.
0.452400	I usually get my blood drawn when I see my doctor. He does it as a good habit, I suppose. I'm terrified of needles.
0.523800	I only go to the doctor for a yearly physical exam, pap smear, and mammogram or if I am feeling ill. I am concerned I may not be explaining what I am feeling properly and give iccurate information. Then, I would receive the wrong treatment.
0.500000	I worry that my doctor might tell something bad about my health.
0.619000	I feel a bit anxious about visiting the doctor's office, due to the results of my vital signs and weight.  Sometimes my blood pressure is a little high when I am at the doctor's office and my physician even knows that this is due to a little nervousness at his office. The reason behind this uneasiness is the fear of finding bad or high risk results about my health.
0.690500	Not knowing the severity of my condition and the thought of being given drugs that will have terrible side effects.
0.357100	I am most anxious of being called out because I haven't kept to a low saturated diet as much as the doctor recommended.  I hate admitting I haven't followed instructions.
0.571400	"I call the chair that I sit in closest to the doctor the ""hot seat"".  :o)  I am always a little nervous going to the doctor.  I wonder if what I am going in for might be something silly and I am making a big deal about a small thing.  Also I worry that they won't find whatever is going on with me and after testing they don't find anything.  I feel a little foolish after that."
0.476200	I worry the most about the diseases that the other patients are bringing to the waiting room. I also worry about the cost and the excuses my insurance company will give me for not covering what they are supposed to cover. I worry a little bit about the quality of care and whether or not anyone in the office will take their profession seriously during my visit.
0.738100	about what he will tell me if something is wrong.sometimes my sugar levels are high and he gets a little upset because he is very concerned about it.
0.285700	I really don't feel nervous visiting.  If it's a check up I feel pretty good about it and don't really worry about what they might fine (I can't change it anyway and would rather know).  I think the only thing I don't like is when they take blood.  Sometimes it goes smooth and other times it's painful as they have to restick me several times.  Other than that it's all good.
0.952400	I think that I'll be diagnosed with the worst condition and will need surgery. I have white coat syndrome so my worries are numerous and most of them are silly but I'm working on meditating to control my anxiety. 
0.690500	I haven't had a male doctor since I was a child.  Now I have a male doctor and I feel very uncomfortable with him.  I think that if I had either a female physician or a male physician who was more concerned and caring I would not have these feelings.
0.357100	I'm sometimes a little anxious about being physically examined by someone I don't know well. I'm sometimes a little worried that there might be something seriously wrong. And crowded waiting rooms and long wait times are stressful, so I don't look forward to that.
0.642900	Even though I am relatively healthy and have no family history of major medical conditions, there is always the chance that something can go wrong. I wouldn't say I am extremely nervous when visiting my doctor but I am a bit anxious. 
0.904800	I don't know what could be wrong with me; the mystery bothers me. I would love to have straight answers at all times.
0.666700	I am usually anxious or worried because I fear that something will be wrong with me.  I worry that I will find that I have diabetes or some other bad news.  
0.238100	I'm often worried that the solution to my problem will be complicated or very time-consuming/expensive.
0.690500	The lack of transparency and uncertainty can be burdensome. Knowing that the doctor knows more about what's wrong with me than I do, and them not sharing all of that information. 
0.952400	I am most worried that he will neglect to find the source of the problem, and I will die due to an error that was easily preventable with a little care for his job. I think they have no consequences for patient deaths, so they do not care if they miss things that will save lives. They do not care for their patients anymore, they just milk them for their sheckles.
0.142900	I just have no faith in any of them and feel I'm going to have to visit at least one more time permitting to get a second opinion and they always say it's something else so then you have to figure out which is correct which means a third opinion or simply suffering until your body kicks the ailment itself.
0.285700	I do not like having blood work done. I hate needles and it makes me uncomfortable.  I also dislike going to my gynecologist. 
0.404800	Most my symptoms are things that I worry about, and not the doctor herself. I am fearful that some of the pains I am having are serious medical conditions.
0.523800	I imagine it would be the uncertainty.  it is also uncomfortable.  why are you even asking this question?  you have to know the answer.
0.619000	Unless it for just a regular check up I'm there for a reason which I need help with I'm worried. If I'm feeling pain especially in abdomen I'm especially worried it might be something serious like cancer.
0.547600	More worried just in case doctor told me something worst thing. 
0.142900	Nothing really does, unless I am there in pain or concerned about my health for some reason, that usually is not the case though.
0.881000	I always feel like they will find something else wrong with me, I take enough meds now
0.666700	Most doctors offices are terribly sterile and uninviting and don't foster any since of being a caring individual. It makes me feel like a piece of meat.
0.690500	If the doctor will sound harsh or criticize me.  If the doctor will ignore or discredit what I say.  If I end up having a really bad health problem.
0.642900	Usually it's things like how bad my cholesterol is, maybe anxious on things that might be suggested by my doctor...and definitely not looking forward to full (yearly) or prostate examition.
0.142900	Not knowing what is wrong with me if I have to go to the doctor or maybe having to get more tests done than I thought.
0.285700	It'll sound odd, but okay. It's extremely rare for me to catch a cold, but I always feel a little anxious about the potential germs. The main reason getting sick bothers me is that it'll get in the way of my weight training (and I happen to be a training stimulus addict). Ironically enough, nothing else bothers me...I maintain a single digit body fat percentage virtually year-round, and my doctor often comes to me for fitness advice ;-)
0.714300	From the smell when I hit the door until I escape, I am anxious about everything. I trust them to a point but am always wondering what they aren't telling me which isn't really fair to my current doc because she is very thorough and takes more time than any other doc has ever spent with me. My blood pressure always skyrockets although it never is away from medical facilities but filly my current doc figured this out. I expect bad things to happen because of past experiences.
0.642900	The unknown of what the doctor will say. You are always worried that the doctor will find something unexpected. 
0.833300	i am getting older now,and i sometimes wonder,if something really horrible will be found wrong with me.it seems i wake up with a new ache or pain daily.
0.142900	I usually feel quite good so I am never nervous about my checkups.  Fortutely I am extremely healthy and always have been.  The worst problem I've had is sciatica and I went to PE for that. 
0.857100	I'm afraid they will find something else wrong or needs to be taken care of that will cost me more money out of pocket even though we have insurance.
0.761900	I just worry they will find some major health issue wrong with me. 
0.428600	the wait and being around other people who could be sick 
0.738100	What makes me most anxious about a doctor visit is two-fold: the thought of finding out something dreadful is wrong OR that nothing is wrong and I look the fool. 
0.285700	I really don't feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor.  The only issue I have is that I had a really bad experience with a doctor in the same practice and I don't really like to see him.  If I do, I just pretend that he isn't there. It is so worth it to see our current doctor that I will deal with seeing the other doctor for a minute or so when we are walking to the exam room.
0.809500	What worries me most is thinking of  all the things the doctor might find. It's stressful to think you may have some disease or cancer and the doctor is about to change your life forever.
0.333300	I always wonder if they will find something else wrong, besides the problem that I am there for.  I usually get a little anxious because I know that I have waited too long before going to see the doctor.
0.428600	They might find major health problems 
0.500000	When I visit my doctor for my examitions I am always anxious about m results. I always think that something might go wrong and this makes me nervous.
0.690500	Sometimes when going into the Dr's office with symptoms that seem like they maybe severe I become anxious while waiting for the exam and tests to determine my issue.  I also get anxious because it seems like the dr always wants to discuss worst possible issues first.
0.690500	Finding out the cause of any medical issues I am contending with. 
0.642900	I worry that I wont cover all the things I feel like I should talk to the doctor about in order for them to give me proper medical care and that the reason I wont is because I worry they will think I'm some kind of hypochondriac (although I see a doctor less than once a year, sometimes if you have a lot of concerns when you see them they seem to become pretty tired and dismissive as the exam proceeds.)
0.357100	i get the white coat syndome when they take my bp it always goes way up and scares me
0.619000	You know when you don't feel well or are in pain, but there are tests and measurements that can locate possible diseases or health issues that I may not even be aware of.  I'm also not very comfortable being ked, so that's very nerve wracking.
0.381000	They advise me on weight loss as if it can be done over night or its really easy.
0.595200	When the doctor is concerned about particular health issues I may have, I get a little anxious and worried but he has been the calm one in this relationship. He makes me feel better by explaining the whole process of care very clearly.
0.595200	I'm always worried when I go to the doctor because of the history of cancer in my family.  I get worried that little things may be precursor's to cancer or something worse.
0.547600	In my current situation, the cost is my biggest concern. Otherwise, I don't really have issues with seeing the doctor. There's only the slightest worry about what might be wrong with me.
0.238100	The potential for a negative visit usually is what bothers me the most. If I've never been to a particular doctor's office, their demeanor mostly gives me cause for worry.
0.761900	Mostly I worry about my condition and how it will affect me. I also get nervous around doctors in general, because usually when you have to see a doctor, you won't be getting good news. So I'm usually already feeling a bit anxious before I even see the doctor.
0.785700	The things that make me feel most anxious is interacting with the doctor and feeling like a may be scolded. The other thing I don't like is just going to the doctor tends to make me feel a general unease. It triggers my social anxiety.
0.333300	My worries at the doctor are usually less about the actual meeting with the doctor than surrounding matters like cost and health insurance. I am sometimes concerned about prescription side effects or misdiagnosis, but am willing enough to accept my doctor's recommendations that it doesn't bother me.
0.142900	I sometimes think about how much the visit to the doctor will cost me. I think of it more as an annoyance than I'm being taken advantage of.
0.761900	That the physician will give you a negative report/diagnosis. Doctors don't have a positive bone in their bodies. It is ALWAYS doom and gloom with them. They just  approach a patient with how the odds of getting well are so low. Their game plan is to give you a lot of medicines or advice a sometimes unnecessary surgery. Again, to make money for hospitals and drug companies.
0.142900	I am anxious to have the exam over with but worried that maybe the results will not be good.
0.309500	i be so anxious to see things like my blood presser and worried if it going to be high 
0.523800	Now that I am 64 I cannot help but worry about what the doctor may find; if there is some condition or clue that I am not even aware about, but may lead me down a serious path of health treatments and expenses. I think I am actually more worried about the possible fincial consequences than the physical discomfort.
0.309500	I feel anxious and worried because I don't know what the doctor will tell me after examining me.
0.595200	Anxious about getting old and sick.
0.404800	during an exam, you do not know what could be found, so that is nerve wracking
0.952400	The thing I worry about most when seeing my doctor is potentially finding out that I have a serious problem and will need surgery. Just the thought of surgery terrifies me!
0.666700	I do feel anxious at times that they won't know what is wrong with me or it will cost a lot of money to heal me.
0.238100	The potential for being diagnosed with something serious, I suppose.
0.690500	I always worry that the doctor will find that something is wrong with me and I wouldn't even suspect.
0.714300	I suppose that it's fear of the unknown.  As I get older I hear about all of the various health issues the others have experienced and I worry that something serious will happen to me. 
0.500000	I have several chronic pain and breathing issues.  I'm always concerned that one of these issues may evolve into something that may become very serious.  I don't like surgery and I don't like hospitals, and I'm always concerned that either may become necessary.
0.452400	Mostly I worry if my health is improving or backsliding. I have a silly worry that he will find some horrible disease or something. I mean, not really, but kind of if that makes sense. I also don't like getting shots. Or the backside exam.
0.928600	The attention of the doctors
0.142900	Not knowing what the doctor will tell me. Uncertainty of the situation.
0.523800	Not really about the doctor but more about what I might find out and how much it will cost.
0.785700	I'm always afraid they will discover some terrible new disease I have to go with the ones I currently experience. 
0.785700	You never know if your next physical could be the one that you find out that you have cancer or some other life-crippling ailment.
0.428600	Well, experience tells me that a little thing can be indicative of a big thing. How do you think I found out about a cancer that resulted in a 3 month hospitalization? A doctors visit, thats how. So, it would be rather unusual to not have trepedation when repeating the visits later. I had to abandon a cafreer because of physical pain and even the doctors that realize the source of the problem are too chicken shit to say so for disability. Seven years later and poverty is the result.
0.142900	I worry that they might find something that I didn't know about and it is very serious.
0.142900	I dont get anxious or worried when visiting a dr office.  There is literally no point in adding stress.
0.714300	Unless I am having a routine visit then there is always a chance that I could have a serious problem. Even when having a routine visit there is that chance, but it is more worrisome when the problem is not something you have normally dealt with. In my case I have a condition that will generally get worse as I age and I am anxious because I may get information that I have gotten worse instead of staying the same. 
0.547600	I feel most anxious or worried at a doctors office wondering if they will listen without being brushed off or ridiculed. They tend to be dismissive when realizing I am not able to tolerate medicine, and rather than researching to find the root cause I often feel brushed off or abandoned. I get anxious or worried because I'm obviously visiting the office for a valid reason and wish they would take a moment and try to help find or recommend an altertive solution. 
0.214300	What makes me most anxious is now knowing what the doctor might find, that is medically wrong with me, during the office visit.
0.476200	Diabetes runs in my family.  I want to make sure that I never get that disease ever in my life. I'm always anxious at the thought of the doctor telling me that I have diabetes whenever I come in. 
0.642900	I feel like I am not going to remember to share all my concerns or that if I bring them up the doctor will think they are stupid. My husband recently brought up concerns I had over a procedure that he needed done and he said the doctor literally said the concern was stupid. 
0.142900	I don't typically feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office.  I know my body and my health very well.  Visits to the doctor's office, up to this point in my life, have been relatively event free.
0.595200	I feel anxious about the exam itself and not speaking well. I get nervous and shy to talk to anyone I do not know well and sometimes stumble over my words. I also get worried over what the prognosis will be. 
0.142900	That I might have to get blood drawn which doesn't hurt it's just an annoying process.
0.642900	Even if nothing feels wrong, I'll get nervous that I've got some major health issue that I wasn't aware of. I'm in my late 30's, and although I'm in pretty good health now, I'm always afraid that issues of some sort are just around the corner for me. 
0.309500	Being in a doctors office. 
0.190500	I will feel worried if i have some health issue since long and will be waiting for the reports from the doctor.
0.571400	that there is something seriously wrong.. 
0.857100	Most of the times it's the uncertainty about how severe the illness is, the pain involved when getting diagnosed etc.
0.738100	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fear of the unknown. Even if I am at the doctors for something minor routine test can show something worse.
0.690500	Getting on the scale and being told that my blood levels are normal when I am having symptoms related to a condition I am on medication for. Also,  an abnormal mammogram, even though it has been a false finding every time.
0.738100	I am anxious and worried that something more serious may be wrong with me than I think. I am embarrassed to talk about certain things with my doctor. I just want to get the exam over and done with because I don't like to be looked at and touched. 
0.952400	I feel anxious because I am afraid he will find something wrong or he will want to send me somewhere for tests I do not want
0.238100	WHat makes me feel most anxious is just the overall doctor visit which I always find unpleasant.
0.785700	They could find that i have a dangerous health issue. 
0.285700	I feel most anxious or worried because I felt feared.
0.214300	Being in hospitals. The sounds, the smell, the sights. I guess it goes back to when I was young, every time I went to the doctor as a kid something was wrong. I guess some of that anxiety cared over to my adult years. 
0.500000	I don't know, really. I'm not scared, just nervous. 
0.547600	 Usually the thought that he might find something that is an illness or has the potential to be bad,  like a tumor or whatnot. It's not so much the examition itself as it is the potential negative outcome of my labs being bad, etc.
0.500000	I am most anxious about the results. I am scared that they will find a disease or condition that will affect my life. I am also anxious about how the doctor will handle my care. Third, I am anxious because I am self-conscious about my body.
0.857100	I'm not sure I can change what will happen. I really don't need to know the answer to many questions I can't afford to treat in the way I would need to do. most problems go away if you can not worry about them long enough.
0.333300	I'm anxious when I am really sick and don't know what's wrong with me. I go into the office expecting the worst. It also makes me anxious when she doesn't know what's wrong, and I have to get more testing done. I am also anxious when I have to see another doctor because my doctor is on vacation. 
0.666700	I am always worried that the doctor will discover something that could lead to something complicated and unwanted.
1.000000	Im afraid that the doctor lacks the basic knowledge to access the condition and prescribe appropriate treatment.I worry that the individual may be more concerned about fincial gains rather than offering sound judgement.
0.238100	It just makes me anxious having to be examined.  I don't have a good reason.  It feels kind of intrusive.
0.714300	Whether they are going to find something wrong and try to pressure me into some 'treatment' which will suppress symptoms and interfere with my body's attempts to heal and rebalance. I really wish that I could find a holistic practitioner who could help me live a tural and healthy lifestyle, making the most of traditiol medical knowledge and modern medicine. 
0.976200	The whole thing is anxiety producing and nerve-wracking. One of the primary contributors to these negative feelings involves my persol knowledge of how physicians frequently behave, think, and act i.e. their utter lack of genuine care or concern for patients, their tendency to essentially ignore patients and just drone on about whatever they would like to, and their tendency to behave like patients are a burden and infringing on their time. 
0.619000	the uncertain of your health or finding some bad news about you
0.500000	I just don't like waiting. I am in pretty good health so I'm not really worried that something terrible is going to turn up. I am always a bit anxious to find out my weight since I have struggled with it in the past. 
0.881000	Examitions require a level of persol interaction that I am very uncomfortable with. I usually only go when I am sick so I am already worried. 
0.285700	I never feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. Even if the appointment is to discuss test results. I am confident if that there is a health issue of concern, my doctor has researched the best possible demerits to present to me.
0.619000	I feel anxious or worried the most when I am sick and go to the doctors. I feel like I may receive some bad news sometimes. It's just an atmosphere where you are not sure if everything will be okay. But I trust my doctor so I am not entirely anxious. 
0.142900	Nothing really.  I like my nurse practitioner and feel like I don't mind going to the doctor's office when needed. 
0.428600	"The lack of concern for my health commonly demonstrated by the doctor. The assumption that I am an ignorant person without the capacity to understand what is being said to me. (That said, having done technical support for years, I can understand that attitude. ""My computer has a big blue screen that says I done somethin' illegal, but I didn't! It's all paid for, legal."" Yes, this is a real event.)"
0.714300	"I've had a bout with thyroid cancer so every doctor visit I think ""what's next?"" and how much will each referral and testing diagnostic cost. It worries me emotiolly and fincially."
0.619000	Often times it's the possibility of having to argue with them about what would be a better treatment for ME. There are certain meds that just aren't necessary, and I hate that I have to go in with the mindset of having to be my own advocate and ready for mild confrontation. A doctor should have my best interest in mind and not just what is easy or done out of habit for them. I also worry I won't be listened to when I try to do my due diligence to list ALL symptoms pertaining to whatever is ailing me. 
0.904800	I worry they will perform a painful procedure.  I worry they will recommend that I have a painful procedure.  I am anxious about rather or not they will listen to my needs, concerns and rather or not they will spend enough time with me.
0.381000	I don't like being poked and prodded, disrobed, made to wait long periods of time in the exam room.
0.761900	I get anxious or worried because I always expect something bad to come out of the situation.  I'm always thinking something more serious is going on than really is. 
0.785700	when my brainscans come back and I'm finding out the results
0.500000	The fact of going there just sparks tural anxiety. I don't want to face any underlying issues. I don't worry too much but just want to be sure all is well. 
0.238100	I don't often feel anxious or worried about going to the doctor.  The only thing that might make me uneasy is the possibility of them discovering I had a life threatening illness.
0.690500	Usually any procedure that involves the doctor inspecting private areas makes me worried.  I don't feel comfortable with that at all.
0.761900	I don't know the person and I feel vulnerable. I don't like talking to stranger or having strangers touch me.
0.881000	If there Is something wrong with my health. If I have to take any long term medication. The process of getting better if there is an illness.
0.666700	I am not sure why I feel like this. It is a general feeling that I have always had. Probably mostly the smell and the idea that I will be in pain ( a shot or a pap smear).  And then recently just frustrated that the doctor will treat me like my situation is stupid.
0.690500	The possibility of finding something life threatening. 
0.238100	I have no problem visiting the doctor's office. Other than the occasiol...I have absolutely no bedside manner doctor, I find doctors very accommodating. I however, hate Pap smears. Unless you've had one you can't possibly understand. So...no problems with going for physical other than pap and a small aversion to needles.
0.809500	I am most worried about finding out bad news about my health when visiting the doctor. More than that I worry about any treatment I may need. I worry about any physical pain I might have to endure and how I will pay for it. Since I can't afford it and my insurance isn't adequate, I worry because I know I probably won't receive proper treatment. 
0.142900	I am not anxious or worried about doctor's visit, but concern about time I don't like the waiting
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when visiting the doctor
0.523800	One of my biggest concerns with visiting a doctor's office involve receiving bad news or being treated too quickly and the doctor not doing a full job. As patients we sometimes wait long periods to see the doctor, so the idea we can be pushed out fast is worrisome.
0.166700	I am made most anxious by having to bare my body during physical examitions. A doctor has never made me feel uncomfortable about this...I just am.
0.500000	Unless I am really ill I don't feel anxious. The one thing that worries me most is when a doctor briefly feels for breast lumps, although that's done so quickly there's not much chance of it. So the chance of having cancer of some kind makes me most worried.
0.190500	I was most anxious and worried about my own health, especially when I wasn't sure what could possible go wrong with me and before a new symptom was diagnosed and confirmed by the doctor.  
0.642900	The diagnosis. I sometimes already have some idea or thought about why I feel bad and I'm afraid that the doctor's diagnostic confirm my suspicions.
0.142900	I don't get anxious about visiting the doctor in the same way that I don't get anxious when shopping for groceries or getting an oil change.
0.571400	I feel that the doctor might find something that is bad like a health condition or a disease that I have recently developed.
0.142900	Not right now. I look forward to makeing sure I am staying healthy now. 
0.809500	I worry that something could be found to be wrong with my heart. Sometimes my blood pressure is higher than it should be when they test it. I worry that the doctor will think I am faking the physical pain and anxiety I feel so that I can get drugs from it.
0.857100	Oftentimes, the silence that hangs in the air from other patients. 
0.738100	The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed anxiety builds. The waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
0.952400	Number one is that they will find something wrong even if I am there to treat something minor.  I will be nervous and worried and then it will most likely be nothing, a mistake.  Or the treatment will do nothing for me.
0.333300	My biggest fear would be a diagnosis which revealed some serious medical condition which I was uware of.
0.452400	Worried because just in case doctor told me something bad about my health condition.
0.190500	Mostly the attitude of the doctors and their staff.  It makes me a bit worried if the staff is not professiol in handling the appointments and/or paperwork.  
0.452400	Unless it's for a regular check-up, I'm at the doctor's office because I''m either injured or ill. My condition would make me a bit anxious. There is also the small chance that the doctor might discover something serious that I was not already aware of. 
0.809500	"Money is the first of the most important concerns. The old saying ""I can not afford to get sick or go to the Dr, hospital, etc.. Applies to most of us including me. The second worry  concern is what the Dr finds out during lab work, exams, etc and the diagnosis and the ""Cost"" I am always concerned that whatever the Dr finds through an exam or test is that they advise you on a standard rule of the most expensive treatment or specialist they can give. I have had many persol experiences with this. There is no such thing as persol, affordable, think out of the box, healthcare treatments. I am treated like a robot in a robot system. I go to my family physician and if there is anything wrong I get sent all over town to specialists and have many appointments and a lot of time and out of pocket expenses and find out later that all of that was not necessary and the health problem could have been handled and treated through my family Dr. simply and a lot less expensive. "
0.761900	That they will find something wrong with me that is very harmful and that would be life changing. Today going to get checked by a doctor with all the things that can go wrong is a very stressful thing.
0.571400	I'm worried about the readings of my vitals that the nurse takes. Those are generally the best way to tell how I'm doing. By the time the doctor comes in, I'm more apprehensive at what the numbers are more than I'm worried about him as a person or physician. 
1.000000	I feel worried each time I visit my doctor because I feel he's going to add me on more medication. He said that my blood pressure continues to increase. The medicine that I'm on already makes me feel dizzy at times. I don't want to be placed on more medication. 
0.333300	The thing that makes me most anxious is waiting to find out If I have a disease that can kill me like diabetes or cancer. Another thing that can make me a bit anxious is having a rectal exam, as it is very uncomfortable.
0.785700	Gynecological examition makes me so anxious and worried because first thing you have to show your private parts, second the thought about the test results.
0.857100	When I sense that the doctor has their own agenda rather than responding to the patient in front of them, it makes me very anxious. When the doctor exhibits arrogant behavior or seems disrespectful, I worry that they won't really listen to me or will discount what I have to tell them. When a doctor seems to assume that every patient is displaying drug-seeking behavior, I worry that they aren't really listening and that I will not get the right treatment.
0.809500	I'm afraid of receiving bad news about my health
0.476200	Its just a very nerve wracking experience, if you don't go to the doctor that often like me, you just never know what illness might pop up.
0.285700	The only thing that worries me is if I am sick, and I am worried that the doctor will have bad news as to the sickness.  I worry that the cure for the ailment would be traumatic or painful; like if I needed surgery.
0.238100	Not knowing what the results of tests or an examition might be. It makes me a little nervous,not knowing what to expect.
0.333300	As I get older, I recognize that my body is aging as well. As the body ages, it tends to degrade. What makes me anxious is if he finds something wrong and wants me to go see other doctors or have tests performed. I don't want to spend the time having to do that.
0.619000	I am particularly uncomfortable with physical examitions and so they make my anxiety flare up.
0.595200	I feel like I'm being judged
0.809500	When I visit a doctor's office, my biggest fer or worry is a negative diagnosis. It is basically the fear of the unknown or the uncertainty of it. 
0.381000	We all want to avoid bad news and pain
0.142900	I only get anxious sometimes in the waiting room because I get social anxiety. 
0.476200	I worry that I may have underestimated the seriosness of my condition. There is usually also the worry that the doctor might find something wrong with me that I did not even suspect.
0.642900	It worries me that my physician will give me bad news about my health. 
0.547600	I am a very nervous person. When I have a doctors appointment I am very antsy and high strung. I fear my diagnosis will one day  be cancer.
0.619000	I just don't like medical visits. You're vulnerable and not in control.
0.714300	"I have to be KED! Well, not exactly. The gown is open in the back though, making me feel exposed and vulnerable. I don't want to turn my head and cough while he checks out my ball sac. Sh*t, he's looking down there a bit too long. Is he gay? Oh, no, here come the latex gloves. ""Bend over,"" he says. "
0.642900	I have a fear across the boards with doctors and dentists. Im afraid of bad news such as cancer or the likes. I think finding out the bad news would make what ever it is get worse faster. I also worry that i will be looked down on, due to weight. Although it hasn't been the case, its still in my head.
0.333300	I always feel a little anxious when someone has to look at my ked body. I also worry that being anxious will throw off my blood pressure readings, I have low blood pressure, and want to keep it that way. I hate getting on the scales as I know my weight is not great for my height. I am always a little anxious when the blood results are given to me. I want to be in excellent health and if I am not I want the doctor to tell me it is something that can be changed by diet or medication.
0.714300	Although I try my best to keep myself healthy, I never know what a medical check-up will bring. I'm just an anxious person in general, so it's hard for me to sit still when someone else has information about me that I don't know. The anxiety comes from wanting to make certain that I'm physically and interlly OK.
0.761900	The number one reason for anxiety when going to a doctor is the cost. I fear they are going to recommend something I can not afford.Or find some form of cancer or something.
0.595200	I am worried about what might be wrong with me.  I worry that it might be really serious.
0.547600	Well, I'm 38, so I just don't want any unwanted surprises. :-) 
0.214300	The time necessary to identify and appropriately mage health issues sometimes worries me, as I do not feel that I can trust my PCP or any other single doctor individually.   I have had too many bad experiences in maging my own care, and that of various family members.
0.166700	When I have to discuss my results that do not know about with him
0.142900	"I don't like it when the physician doesn't know what is wrong and has to refer me to a specialist. For example, I asked my physician ""Why can't you just do the biopsy?""  She said she didn't have the resources in the office.  It makes me very anxious when I have to make an appointment with another physician and wait while I don't know what is wrong.  This has happened to me in the last year.  Then for the BIGGEST thing that makes me anxious is worrying if my insurance, UHC, is going to try to pull some nonsense to get out of paying for something.  They actually did this, they made every nonsensical excuse not to pay the physician for the biopsy.  The physician's office eventually wrote off the expense, but that is not fair to them.  SO, my insurance trying to get out of paying is what makes me most anxious.  "
0.476200	I am always concerned when I go to a doctor appoint even if it is just for a check-up.  I am not sure why I get so nervous.
0.833300	I worry that something is seriously wrong.
0.166700	The doctor is not totally alert. Wrong diagnosis. Visiting a doctor for the first time.
0.571400	I always fear the worst when I have a symptom or pattern of symptoms. As such, I am not so much anxious about the doctor in particular, but about learning about conditions I may have.
0.619000	I am anxious when my mother is there with me. She will ask questions and sometimes , when the physician asks me a question, she will pop in with her input before I speak.
0.381000	I'm frequently worried that I won't be able to correctly explain my problem, or mess it up so that he won't fully believe me. It's also worrisome that doctors frequently prescribe things that you know isn't what you need.
0.619000	I guess, just the possibility that something could be wrong, or that the doctor will try to steer me down a path I don't totally agree with. However, it's best to address any issue asap. 
0.381000	The thing that makes me feel most anxious and worried is getting blood drawn. I also get nervous when I have to get a shot. Also, pap smears.
0.666700	Generally, when you enter a doctor's office, it's either to receive treatment or advice regarding an existing issue or concern.  The best case scerio when going is that nothing is wrong, or it is not as serious as suspected.  The anxiousness or worry stems from the altertive scerio, that the issue is more serious, the issue requires additiol treatment, and the issue may not only affect my future health, but could include significant out of pocket costs.
0.666700	I would just get a little worried about what the doctor diagnostic would be, hoping that what might be wrong would not be major or life changing.
0.523800	 One never  knows the outcome .. the potential is there for all  kinds of problems.
0.261900	if I have an extreme illness and it may be caught too late
0.904800	I definitely get anxious when I visit the doctors because I feel like they will find something serious.  I tend to jump to the worst conclusion when a test result comes back and when I am asked to come in again.  I get really nervous/worried when I have to wait for those results because I often go into a rabbit hole of reading things on WebMD and other sources to find out more.  Knowing that these visits are to prevent illness from happening or help cure them only eases these worries a little. 
0.428600	Finding out what is wrong with me. Or having him find something new that is devastating. I worry about what the diagnosis might be.
0.761900	It's just a part of my persolity. I am an anxious person. I sometimes feel worried that there will be something wrong with me.
0.142900	Whether I need to be here.  Whether they can help me.  Whether this is a good value for my money.
0.523800	I am worried when the time to know the results of tests. I am worried whether my conditions are getting better, dosages of medicines are right for me in the past three months, when I may proceed for reproduction, ... etc.
0.523800	finding out something wrong could make me feel a little anxious or worried but in general I prefer to know.
0.833300	I always think something will be wrong. I think they won't take me serious.
0.928600	It is just uncomfortable.  It is not something you do everyday so when the time comes for an appointment it makes me anxious.  I worry about gaining weight or my blood work numbers not being in the range they should be.
0.285700	Having to weigh myself in the beginning.

0.142900	I am most anxious when I do my blood work or when I have a pap smear. I always fear the worst. I don't know why, but I always feel like something is wrong. Things usually turn out alright, but I still always doubt things.
0.642900	I am worried the doctor will find something that is wrong with me and that I have health problems I wasn't aware of.
0.285700	Whenever anyone goes to the doctors, we are going at our most vulnerable state. We think there's something wrong with us. We always await the worse news. But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's not as scary as I thought.
0.571400	When I have to get a cancer screening or something of that nature done. I really get worried when my kids or loved ones visit the doctor to be honest.
0.333300	If I know I have to get blood drawn I will get very nervous and have a panic attack, I do not like needles and that makes me anxious, otherwise I never have many issues while visiting the doctors office.
0.619000	Just the unknown of what is going to happen.  No one wants to get shots or have to draw blood, or find out something looks strange on you.  Those things would make anyone anxious and nervous.
0.142900	I am mostly anxious about the diagnosis. I also get anxious about being left in the examination room for a long period of time before getting seen. It almost becomes claustrophobic to the point that I need to get up and open the door.
0.142900	I would feel anxious visiting the doctor if I had something going on that was scaring me or that was something major that was wrong with me. Sometimes I worry that if I go in for something that it won't be solved.
0.571400	I have anxiety so just going to meet with someone I do not know well in a public place automatically causes me to feel anxious and worried. Couple that with it relating to my health it is more severe.
0.142900	The unknown of what the answer will be. I've had some pretty serious health issues happen and there are chances of reoccurrence. 
0.857100	Not knowing what is going to happen. Worrying that there is something wrong with me. Not trusting the doctors.
0.428600	I think that there may be some hidden cost and it becomes an unattainable thing for me to get. It could be something worse.
0.309500	I sometimes get nervous about talking about an embarrassing symptom that I might be experiencing, or I get worried that an serious illness might be diagnosed in tests. 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when visiting my doctor's office.  The staff are always very nice and make me feel comfortable, and my doctor has fantastic bedside manner that makes me feel at ease.  The only thing I would feel worried about is not knowing what's wrong with me.
0.714300	Being sick and assuming it's the worst possible thing. I'm worried about getting sicker in the waiting room with other sick people around. I'm worried about procedures that might hurt or feel embarrassing, such as bloodwork or bad side effects or something, and embarrassing as far as potentially showing body parts I don't normally show and talking about bodily functions
0.285700	Just because if you're going to the doctor, something is wrong with you.  You don't know what's going on, and if it's something serious.  Nobody wants to hear that bump on their head could possibly be malignant.  It's fear of the unknown that makes me nervous, not necessarily fear of the doctor.
0.571400	I always get anxious that the doctor will criticize me in some way or blame me. I also get anxious that I will receive bad news and require more medical care that is outside my financial budget.
0.690500	Just not knowing what exactly is wrong with me is scary. If i go in knowing oh it's just a sore throat or the cold or something isn't that big of a deal. but if i'm going in for a blood test or something like that, it gets a little scary.
0.571400	i am anxious to talk about what is going on with me and im anxious to find out if something new is wrong with me
0.357100	Sometimes I feel anxious or nervous when I'm getting a physical exam by a physician because I'm worried they will find something wrong. 
0.142900	Nothing. I don't worry about it. I don't think anyone really does. It's such a normal part of people's lives like putting gas in a car
0.881000	Like I ALREADY wrote, I don't like waiting.  I want to get crappy situations done with as soon as possible so I'm not sitting around dreading and thinking about the worst case scenario.
0.619000	I am sometimes afraid that there will be something seriously wrong with me. I sometimes dread hearing the worst, but so far, it has always turned out just fine. 
0.619000	When I go to the doctor, I often think if I happen to have something that is not yet discovered in me as those silent diseases that makes me feel anxious
0.428600	I feel the most anxious or worried about what the unknown could be when I visit the doctor for an illness other than a cold. I wonder what could be the cause and if it is something serious. 
0.285700	I don't have a good track record with caring, thoughtful doctors. Most tend to disregard what I say or think about whatever's happening to me. In addition, I have a poorly understood chronic disease (CFS/ME) that many doctors refuse to even admit exist, despite overwhelming new information that it is a biological illness.
0.285700	I get most worried about the doctor not being able to find a diagnosis for what is wrong with me. I have had some health problems in the past that I have had a hard time finding a diagnosis for. This means more waiting and more doctor's visits in the future.
0.500000	Having to wait a long time. This is a waste of my life.  Doctors seem to overbook their appointments.
0.285700	I only feel anxious when I know there's something wrong with me or I feel terribly ill. When I'm feeling that way, I start worrying that I might have something serious.
0.142900	Just the waiting process. i do not like to be in a room full of strangers waiting to be seen by a doctor. Other than that, i am completely comfortable with it and do not have any problems at all. 
0.285700	I think getting a bad dianosis is probably the worst part about going to the doctor and also what keeps me from going to the doctor is that fear that something will not be good
0.476200	I feel anxious or worried because I feel like I can predict what they are going to say. They are going to talk about how I need to lose 20 pounds and they will ask me questions about my lifestyle and recommend ways to lose weight.  It is a sensitive topic for me and I just don't want to talk about it, let alone with a stranger.
0.571400	when we visiting the doctor it would be very difficult to seem it.It would be very fair of it.Getting a treatment it would be very important of it
0.690500	I've always been anxious when going to the doctor's office but it has nothing to do with my doctors or their staff. I'm always concerned that some small ailment will end up being a larger issue. I've also had family members diagnosed with serious illnesses, so I worry that my time will be up at some point.
0.571400	I never know what to expect. My family has a history of cancer, so I'm always afraid that routine scans or checkups will result in them finding something that shouldn't be there. I'm concerned that I won't know how to react to what they tell me, or that  they won't find something until it's too late. 
0.285700	my psa count as it is an indication of cancer. thankfully mine is normal and has been everytime taken. but it is the test i worry most about though i think my dr is more worried about bp
0.833300	I am an anxious person in general, and medical stuff makes me especially anxious. I think my fear is that the doctor will tell me that I have a serious health problem that I didn't know I had. I worry a lot about those types of things.
0.476200	I always worry what they might find. I have a history of cancer and diabetes in my family and I am always concerned that is going to become a issue in my life as well. I guess that is what I am most worried about, something that I can not control happening and altering my life.
0.619000	I worry that something about my health will be wrong. I'm afraid that I will have a terrible health issue, or even something minor but inconvenient. I think about how I'm a bit overweight and that is going to eventually cause health issues. I wonder if this appointment will be the one where I find out that my weight has caused some issues.
0.809500	What makes me most anxious is the fear that my doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I also fear many of the procedures, as well as just interacting with medical people in general. The latter comes with me just having an avoidant personality disorder.
0.785700	That they'll find something wrong with me or something like that or tests will come back positive....
0.357100	I am more worried about getting the news than I am after I have received the news and know how to take care of the situation.
0.142900	I worst fear is that of catching a cold or flu from someone else that does not take the same needed precautions as I do. for example, washing hands.
0.571400	That I'll actually find myself and that will actually read to do something that I don't actually either want or need; basically that I won't be completely honest with the Dr.
0.309500	I just don't like being at the doctors.  I always remember what happened with the Tuskegee men's study and I'm worried about how doctors can abuse their power.
0.547600	I really get nervous about multiple things such as giving blood or other tests that I have not experienced. I can say I am kinda a baby when it comes to tests and such that doctors may do. This may stem from the fact I have not been to the hospital before for anything serious
0.214300	Mainly Iâm concerned about spending too much time in the waiting room around people who have a contagious illness. 
0.857100	i think it's the fear of finding out you have some sort of illness / disease that you weren't aware of before. i am especially nervous about blood test results
0.690500	I just generally don't like interacting with people on a very personal level.  I don't like to be touched, I like to be private.  Getting undressed in front of a stranger in a strange place and having them poke and prod and examine me asking personal questions is semi traumatic.  
0.476200	I just don't like doctors offices or hospitals in general.  I have never had any health issues so I am not afraid something is wrong with me.  I just have never liked them.
0.142900	If I have a problem that I'm unsure what it is. Everyone is always scared of the what seems like the inevitable. The inevitable is the big C word. Cancer. Either we die from a heart related problem or cancer most likely. It's just a matter of time.
0.190500	Nothingg at the moment.  I'm mostly healthy expect for my weight from drinking habits.  I started having random pain that was constant and moderate to serve I would worry about what the diagnosis is at that point.
0.547600	When I do go to the doctors office, because past doctors have never believed me on my condition I was always feeling anxious and worried throughout the visit. However, this has slowly went away. Still for some visits I become anxious or worried that my conditions may be developing further in a negative way. 
0.666700	One thing that makes me feel most anxious is the fact that there might be something wrong with me. That worries me, and I stress out about it.
0.523800	I am not sure what it is. I guess I am introverted so sitting in a quiet room with someone I donât know well is uncomfortable. Also I donât want them to think I am seeking drugs 
0.333300	I know I am going to feel foolish saying this but I absolutely hate getting shots. It's not the pain that it causes but rather the mental build-up of thinking of the needle going in you and all the blood.
0.595200	I feel worried about whether I can get my questions answered and whether I can get the care I need. I have at times not received the treatment I feel I needed or the correct medicines when I have needed them. 
0.285700	I think the worst part of it is just the waiting and the anxiety that provides to you, not knowing what might happen or what is wrong with you
0.690500	I am always a bit anxious with doctor appointments. I think that there is just that factor of the unknown that makes people worry. 
0.261900	I don't. I feel relaxed and I don't care. They are people just like me, and if they are trying to do their best for me, I don't have to worry about what is going on.
0.285700	I'm generally not a person that worries much about anything. Unless, I am in a great deal of pain or agony, I'm confident that there's nothing seriously wrong with me. Now, if there's every an instance where I'm experiencing great pain and the doctor can't figure out why, then that would make me anxious.
0.142900	usually I am most anxious or worried when I have to visit the doctors office for my children. I never want to see my children in pain and taking them to the doctor with the thought that they may need a surgery or another inverention is what worries me. I also want to make sure I am making the best deicions for my child's health - it is a big responsibility to have someone else's health in your hands when they cannot make decisions for themselves yet.
0.714300	I just get the feelings that I would expect most people to get.  If you're at the doctor then something must be wrong.  I just want to get it over with and get out of there.  If you are having fun and enjoy visiting the doctor then something is not right with you!
0.928600	I am always worried that something will be very wrong and I don't like being touched by strangers. I also worry that I will need to get my blood drawn and needles scare me

0.785700	Sometimes the most common thing is the unknown. What if they find something wrong with me that is far worse. I would sometimes rather not know then to know something is wrong. That would be the only real fear, or worry is finding out something that might be truly wrong.
0.571400	I used to be worried about the cost most of all, but I now have stable finances and appropriate insurance so that is less of a worry.  I worry that they'll tell me something scary about my health, like needing surgery or having a chronic uncurable condition.  I've needed surgery that had me on bed rest for a week and it wasn't pleasant.
0.142900	I would feel most anxious about any test results I may be getting back.  I would also be a little anxious about the potential that something may be very wrong and I would need an extended hospital stay.

I dread the idea that I may have some kind of serious illness and that it will affect my life significantly. 
0.190500	Being diagnosed with cancer would have to be my number one worry, even though I have never been diagnosed with it before, its just a really worry for me, and I do things in my life to try to avoid this diagnosis.
0.761900	Being able to adequately explain my concerns, anticipating the response of the doctor, being ignored or talked down to, the actual physical exam also makes me anxious because I don't like being touched.
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious is if they discover something that is wrong with me that I do not expect in the least. I am a very healthy person, but it would be extremely upsetting if something like that came up.
0.785700	The fear that I've not taken care of myself well enough and it will result in a malady that I could have avoided.  The prospect of not being well for my children.
0.500000	I just hope he doesn't come to me with bad news with something wrong. I am most fearful of cancer which can strike anyone without warning, and causes emotional harm for the whole family.
0.476200	Anything can go wrong at any time. I'm in good health, but you never know. There is always this little bit of anxiousness that something could be wrong or something in the future.

0.619000	I sometimes feel like I am being judged by my doctor. Also, I am anxious that I will be misdiagnosed again. 
0.309500	I really can't think of anything, other that coming in one day and finding out a have a NEW doctor that I wasn't informed of beforehand, especially after having gotten used to my current one.
0.357100	The thing that worries the most is if my insurance is going to cover things that I might need to do. This bothers me more than any kind of procedure that I can imagine getting.
0.690500	"I get nervous by the ""formality"" of the setting. Sometimes the setting is too clinical and not very personable. I worry about these things and not about the outcome of the visit."

0.976200	the unknown, not knowing what you could possibly find out about being sick. I worry about being judged by the doctors or nurses for my appearance or health care issues.
0.928600	I am worried about what is causing all my pain and problems. Add to that how long it is taking to find out it makes me more worried each time I go
0.452400	I'm worried mostly about two things: 1) do I have a serious long term health issue that will be revealed to me? 2) If I mention minor things that are bothering me, will the doctor thing I'm wasting his/her time?

0.761900	I'm always anxious that I will get some bad news about my health, especially if its something I don't see coming. I enjoy being active and feeling healthy. I wouldn't want anything to jeopardize that or to have a long/lasting effect on my family. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. However, I also would want to catch any problems as soon as possible to hopefully battle whatever it is that I have going on.
0.595200	Well i am worried they might find out i have some reare diease or something like that and that could have a big impact on my life and well being
0.476200	That the doctor will not believe me when I describe my symptoms - or that he will argue with me about how I feel.  
0.571400	that he isnt going to give me a proper diagnosis and just give me anything to get me in and out of the office. i am to the point where i am not going to want to go there anymore. the hospital system is fine it is just the care isnt there, 
0.714300	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is finding out that I have any major problems or issues.

0.142900	I really don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor but I suppose I will try to explain some reasons why I might.  The first and most important would be if I am concerned about my own condition or symptoms being something way more severe than it might be.
0.738100	I am worried that they will discover something that is wrong with me. I know i am healthy but there is always a suspicion that something is wrong and they will discover it. It just more nerves about having a bad disease discovered. 
0.785700	I worry that I will receive random and unexpected bad news regarding an unavoidable health problem. Additionally, even though I am a healthy weight, exercise, and otherwise take care of myself, I expect without reason to be scolded for doing something wrong health-wise.
0.785700	I think it is the closeness and intimacy in a stranger looking at and examining my body, as well as not knowing what is wrong or what could be wrong with me.

0.571400	I usually present with a specific problem.  Feeling somewhat anxious about a new problem is a normal response.
0.595200	"I'm most concerned that the doctor will find something wrong with me that was clearly my fault.  It's not so much that there's something wrong with me that bothers me; it's being faulted for my lifestyle and choices.  That seems really backwards and silly, perhaps, but that's my bigger fear.  It's not them saying, ""There's something wrong with you.""  It's them saying, ""You haven't been taking care of yourself."""
0.785700	What makes me feel very anxious is probably the fact that I wont know the results until a couple weeks after the appointment. Therefore I tend to worry a lot about the results and the outcome while visiting the doctor office.
0.357100	If I am having an issue that I am not sure about or pains that I do not have all the time.  i do worry about terminal diseases and things of that nature.  If you are experiencing things that you donât know anything about it can be a highly tense situation.

0.714300	I am often worried that the doctor will not have a solution for me. Often the doctor proposes a possible solution, but rarely suggests a solution that will definitely address my problem. Because my time with the doctor often feels hurried, I am worried that all of my concerns will not get addressed. I also get anxious when I have to discuss problems that are somewhat uncomfortable or may be perceived as embarrassing for me. I also hate needles, and worry about whether the doctor will recommend a blood test.
0.285700	I feel a little anxious to know if I have good news or bad news. Obviously I am hoping for some good news, but it doesn't always turn out that way.
0.404800	The idea that I'm going to have to pay for it, or will need to buy medication, or will have to put up with a serious amount of tests.
0.642900	I think I'm afarid of the what if? What if they think I have something wrong that I do not and then they mess me up for life with meds or surgery I do not need, I have seen to make people abdicated to pills to need to be that way. Plus the cost and hassle makes me out of sorts.  
0.666700	I'm worried that they'll find something wrong with me that went undetected and will seriously impact my life.
0.285700	I just generally feel this way whenever I am out and about, doing things. I am a bit shy so I get nervous when I'm interacting with a lot of people.

0.428600	Mostly what upsets me is the fear of the unknown. I rarely go to the doctor because I have a good understanding of the human body and various illnesses/injuries.

0.785700	I often feel anxious when discovering the results. Even if sometimes I know the condition is not anything to worry about, I feel very tense.
0.595200	A lot of times my concerns and symptoms are dismissed, and I am rushed out of the office.  It feels like my doctor is only there to put out fires and deal with absolute emergencies.  With smaller issues/pains that could potentially develop into something worse, she doesn't have the energy to investigate or deal with them.  The same attitude is prevalent with other doctors I've seen.
0.285700	I hate change and fear of the unknown. Waiting is also very hard especially when waiting on routine blood work, my mind will race and come up with utterly ridiculous scenarios. I fear the negative results of what has been in my family history.
0.738100	I worry they will find something bad.  I don't like to hear negative things about my heath.  I worry I will have to take more medication and I don't react well to medications.
0.285700	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most likely to feel anxious or worried about someone there making me sick.  I absolutely hate to be in small areas full of sick people.  If I could isolate myself in a little personal bubble/pod while in the waiting room, I would certainly not mind the doctor adding a few bucks to his rate to cover it.  Why don't you invent that and throw me a few bucks?
0.547600	I always worry about the what if. What if something is wrong what do we do if something is wrong. Sometimes I think too much into something and that just makes me worry.
0.761900	i worry that something is wrong withe me. i worry that they wont know how to help me. i worry that they will tell me bad news. i worry that they will tell me i am overweight and need to lose weight. I cant go to the doctor without being told that i am overweight.

0.214300	Fear of the unknown. He might find something wrong that I don't want to know or hear about. I usually wait as long as possible before going to the doctor. We don't have a lot of money so I wait until the problems pile up and I have no other choice but to go. 
0.476200	Walking into the doctor, you have no idea what is going on with your body. Sometimes you might need to do further study and look deeper into the body to see if there is anything wrong. There is always uncertainty if you go into the office with some kind of symptom that seems normal, but it could be worst than you thought.
0.809500	worried that they won't take the time to answer all my questions.  Will be made to feel that I am a bother for having questions/concerns
0.690500	I'm worried that they will say something about my weight or blood pressure or that I'll have a negative result when I go. I know that I don't have the healthiest exercise or eating or drinking routine and I'm sure that it'll catch up to me at some point. So, the concern is that it catches up to me when I'm at the doctors and I get awful news.
0.666700	I don't like the impersonality there often is when being examined. It feels, sometimes, like being a car or something else that is being checked for malfunctions, rather than a person: the way you are led to a room and have to sit around waiting for the doctor, for instance. It also feels somewhat invasive to be examined in that way, and that makes me self-conscious.
0.142900	the cost or chance some of my blood work would come back showing a positive result for some unforeseen disease.
0.357100	I think what makes me feel the most nervous is learning that there might be something wrong with me that I did not know about before even going to the doctor in the first place.
0.690500	Uncertainty is the key to promote anxiety in my opinion. During the visit, I am worried when I meet with the PCP to discuss the outcome of the examination. The main reason is the uncertainty about the result. What if something really bad happens? What is my current health condition? I cannot control my feeling in the uncertain condition.
0.142900	The only thing that makes me feel anxious. Is I had surgery for female reproductive problems. The surgery has a 40% failure rate and I go the doctor every 6 months to see if the procedure is still holding or not. That can be a little disconcerting because if it fails I have to have another surgery.
0.690500	I am always uneasy in a doctors office.  I have never gone there for a good time and usually good news means that they have nothing bad to tell you.  I tire of hearing I am getting old and also the rotation of doctors with the current state of health care and insurance in the country.
0.595200	You're afraid of finding out answers in case they might be bad. You're afraid of the cost. You're afraid of being embarrassed. You're afraid of being vulnerable. You're not sure what's going to happen, and there's a possibility of bad news, so you immediately only focus on the negative.
0.952400	I am usually worried about what the doctor will say. I don't want to hear any bad news. I also worry that they won't find anything when I know there is something wrong. There have been times where my doctor would say that I was fine, but I knew I wasn't. I also am anxious about what type of tests they will do. My biggest fear is blood work. I usually know when I am getting it, but I always hope they won't do it. 
0.309500	Whenever I'm visiting the doctors office I feel like I tend to get the most anxious whenever I have to be weighed. I also get a little bit anxious whenever I'm sitting in the exam room and have to wait for the doctor to walk in because I just want to know what's going on with me as soon as possible and having to wait just makes me feel like I'm on pins and needles and I start to get worried that it could end up being something worse than what I'm expecting it to be that's going on with me.
0.190500	What usually concerns me most is how much it is going to cost. Though I have insurance the bill can sometimes still be considerable.
0.881000	I am concerned that I am broken that there is something wrong with my body that is not fixable or is not responding to treatment. This anxiety resonates with me every single day, but is at its highest when I am getting an exam at the doctor's office.
0.381000	When I don't know if I've collected enough symptoms through tracking to be able to get a diagnosis. A diagnosis is hard to get, but once you have one, you can make a plan and do something about the problem. I hate knowing something's wrong but not being able to get help for it, and every time I go to the doctor with a problem, I'm afraid it's going to happen again.
0.619000	If I am going to the doctor for a health problem I can get a little anxious nervous and scared. I have a habit of always fearing the worst.
0.142900	What makes me anxious when going to the doctor is maybe finding out something that is worse then what i thought
1.000000	I am afraid and worried when I have blood work done because  I always think they are going to find something wrong with me. Also, I am afraid they are going to change the dosage of the medicine I am taking for my auto-immune disease because they would rather go by the lab work then how I feel. 
0.428600	I feel anxious mostly because of just the uncertainty of what I  might find out, I think I go with the attitude to expect the worse. I also get upset because of having to wait for the doctor to do the exam, The waiting builds up my anxiety.
0.142900	I think i'm pretty healthy, my doctor says so. So i don't really fell worried or anxious visiting him. Basically it's just the routine checkup, what can go wrong? 
0.666700	I get worried that the doctor will find something is seriously wrong with me and I'll be blindsided by the diagnosis. I once had a regular checkup with my OB GYN where my doctor suspected I had a lump and referred me for a mammogram. This was alarming as I had no idea that would be an issue. I was also in my 20s. The mammogram showed that I was fine. But now I worry about it happening again.
0.642900	Not sure if they know what they're doing. Doctors seem to be really good at Emergency Care, and invasive procedures but a lot of the rest of the care they give is hit and miss or just plain wrong.
0.333300	I do not feel anxious at all when visiting a doctors office for normal reasons. They tend to be good at diagnosing and treating conventional illnesses. I just do not trust them with anything beyond that really. The only other reason I may be anxious is if it is flu season. The last two times I have had the flu, I caught it at the doctors office seeking treatment for something else. 
0.642900	That I could potentially find something wrong with my body or something that's out of sync, whether it be blood pressure or even my weight. I feel like if something could go wrong, even a small chance, it's something that I'll think about.
0.547600	It depends on the doctor and the reason for the visit. If I have to go to the gynecologist, it's stressful due to the extreme invasion of privacy. I'm normally not anxious when going to my primary care doctor, unless I have to provide a blood sample. I have an extreme fear of needles.
0.976200	I normally have a lot of anxiety when seeing a doctor not necessarily because I am worried the doctor will not be good enough, but because I am afraid about the uncertainty caused by not knowing what is wrong with me since I am at the doctor to find out what it is. I may find out that it is something really bad so I am scared of that. I am also afraid that the tests that need to be done will cause me pain or discomfort, and I am especially scared of needles.

0.571400	Usually if I am seeing a doctor it is because something is wrong.  I am a natural worrier and tend to worry that it is the worst case scenario.  Even though I usually know deep down it's not the worst case scenario, I feel tense until the doctor tells me that.

0.214300	Contracting the flu or another airborne pathogen while waiting in the waiting room. Other than that, not much. Most of our visits are well checks where we have no urgent medical treatment needs. So, we spend most of our time making sure our hands are washed and cleaned and use both face masks for protection.
0.404800	I hate social interaction the most. I don't care about the results, because I know that I'm in good shape and doing everything correctly.
0.976200	I feel like the doctor will tell me something bad, something that will effect my life or the way I lead my life. I am fearful of all possible outcomes. I worry about these things that may hurt my family if I am sick.
0.142900	Just hearing some bad news but I know they are just doing their job at the end of the day, so whatever they do is understandable.
0.714300	Sometime I get worried that something will be wrong. I have two beautiful daughters and I always want to be healthy for them. I also have a long family history of breast and ovarian cancer. As well as heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. I always worry that I maybe suseptable to one of these conditions and it worries me.  I ear that one day I will be checked or tested and Iâll end up with a condition that a family member of mine had.

0.666700	"After having blood work, I know my cholesterol is high and I know that he is going to ""lecture"" me about my eating habits which makes me very uncomfortable, he wants me to bring it down naturally."
0.571400	I feel like I am not going to be able to clearly explain how I am feeling to her. I don't want he to think I am over exaggeration anything so I kind of hold back but then I feel she won't really understand what I am dealing with.

0.595200	Well it's always a scary situation as you get older when you go to the doctor because even if it's something minor they may find something major and the thought is always scary. 
0.190500	I think the most obvious answer is that nobody wants to hear something is wrong with them.  I have an unnatural fear of death anyways.  I do not have a regular physician because I am almost never sick.  So on occasion, when I have been sick or something has been wrong that I felt that I needed to go the doctor, I have worried that I would hear bad news.  The mind tends to go to worse case scenario.  I go to get a yearly mammogram and a yearly pap smear-neither of which is a pleasant experience just for the fact that it leaves me exposed. So that is enough to cause anxiety but add to that the possibility that they will find something wrong is always enough to cause worry.
0.500000	The thought of finding out that something is worse than i thought. Especially during the cancer screening. I also worry when i am actually hurt because i know now that they are less likely to prescribe useful medication because of the opium epidemic. A cough that used to get prescribed cough medicine now gets crazy lung numbing pills that are newish to the market. not a fan. I worry about anything they may find, and how i will pay for all of it.

0.571400	I'm a very introverted person.  I prefer to keep to myself and am usually comfortable talking with anyone outside my immediate family about health issues or mental health issues.  As such, even though I'm fairly familiar with my primary care physician, it still makes me a bit uncomfortable and a bit nervous, or anxious.
0.166700	A dreadful diagnosis such as a terminal disease, cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, or organ failure. Anything that makes me worry about dying is worrisome.
0.642900	I think I always think the worst when I go, I act as if I am going to walk in and they're going to tell me I have some deadly disease. I usually feel like when I leave I feel better automatically no matter what is wrong just because I find out there is nothing wrong with me (that can be long term bad).
0.142900	The most anxious I feel is the wait for the Doctor. I understand that they are busy, but when I sit around waiting long past appointment times I feel like they do not value my time in the same sense that I value theirs by being on time.
0.333300	Nothing really makes me all that anxious. Sometimes I dont like talking about my mental health issues like anxiety or depression because that just sucks. 
0.881000	I get anxious and worried every time I visit the doctor. I'm not quite sure what it is to be exact of the reason that I'm so afraid, but I think that it has a lot to do with me being afraid that something is going to go wrong. When I'm worried, my blood pressure usually shoots up from me worrying a lot. I feel so much dread when going to the doctor. 
0.785700	I am always concerned that there is some underlying issue that I am not aware of, and am fearful that I will get test results that reflect this. Also I am not a fan of being touched even in normal circumstances so that is stressful for me.
0.785700	I never visit the doctor for a good reason, i'e either sick or injured so worrying about the worst case is human nature. Plus the whole thing is uncomfortable, with the doctor feeling up your member, them taking your pee, the waiting room, and paying for it all.  
0.571400	I get nervous about being around a lot of sick people. If I'm seeing a different doctor than normal I'm worried that they won't take me seriously. I also worry that there might be something really wrong with me if I can't figure out what is wrong on my own.
0.857100	I try to take good care of myself, but I know I don't always make the best choices. And I worry and have anxiety all the time anyways.   So it's just worse when I need to visit a doctor. I always think and worthy about the worst possible scenarios.

0.261900	I get most worried that I'll be told I have a serious medical condition of some kind, particularly cancer. My family doesn't have a history of cancer or anything, but some of my behavior throughout my life with substance abuse has led to what I think is a higher risk of certain cancers, so that is what makes me most anxious about going to a doctor. But it's not something I dwell on.
0.785700	Not know what they are doing to find or say about what they find. They always say something is wrong so they can push a pill or want you to come back and keep paying them. The health system isnt really designed to cure you because they would lose customers then.
0.571400	i worry they are going to push drugs. I like to do things holistically and the militry drs dont often like that
0.381000	While being pregnant, I always worried about the doctor appts. Is the baby ok? Will the heartbeat sound strong? Are there complications.  I have found that specifically with this circumstance, I was very anxious.
0.738100	THINKING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. KNOWING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG AND MY LIFE MIGHT CHANGE JUST LIKE THAT.
0.547600	I am usually worried that something will hurt. I also donât like that Iâm usually in some form of undress. It makes me uncomfortable. 
0.619000	"i get anxious or worried from the very situation of being in a doctor's office or medical setting. This is commonly referred to as ""White coat syndrome"", and I believe I suffer from it as well as a lot of the general population. "
0.738100	First, the paper gown is a nightmare. Who doesn't feel anxious wearing only a bit of paper? My usual appointment is for an annual exam, so there's always anxiety about having potentially cold and uncomfortable metal objects put in my girl bits. And, of course, the fear that the doctor is going to find something horrible/fatal
0.714300	I never liked hospitals or clinics. Those places always made me anxious as a kid and I guess I never got over it. My fear of needles also contributes to that anxiousness. 
0.285700	I am usually not worried when I visit the doctor's office. I take most things as they come. If I had to think of something that makes me anxious, it's the thought of what the visit to the office might cost me, and how much I will have to pay out of pocket since I don't have insurance. Other than that, I don't get nervous when I go to the doctor.
0.809500	What makes me feel most anxious is just not knowing whether or not I'm alright medically. I don't know if I'll need to increase, decrease, or change my medication.
0.642900	The potential for being disagnosed with something new and dangerous can make me feel worried.  The potential for being pressured into new medicines and/or shots can make me feel worried.  Being told to take 2 different blood medications when I have not yet started taking the first one makes me feel worried and manipulated.
0.404800	I sometimes worry that there might be something major wrong with me. Like I fear the worst sometimes like if I would to be diagnosed with cancer or something life threatening. 
0.666700	The fact that I may find out bad news about my health makes me feel worried. For example, my last visit was a pap smear. A few days later, my doctor emailed me saying that they have to do my pap smear over because there were not enough cells to test.
0.428600	I always worry that they will find something that is going to be a problem in my life.  I think I go in hoping for the best and expecting the worse.  But so far so good, nothing wrong with me yet.(knock on wood)
0.571400	I am usually nervous when i need to have any blood work done. It is a terrible feeling, especially if you have to do it on an empty stomach. No matter the assurance that the doctor gives me, i still know that it is going to be an unpleasant experience.
0.881000	I am afraid that something will be discovered that has gone unnoticed, such as cancer! I am nervous at being inspected closely. I am nervous that something is wrong that will be missed or misdiagnosed. I am nervous about my body shape or life choices being judged. I am nervous about the financial cost. I am nervous that some drug will be recommended that I do not want to take or that will be expensive or will have side effects.
0.476200	Just learning something new about my health, especially if it's something negative. But haven't really experienced that so it makes me worry that one day something might come up unexpectedly.
0.142900	I have a severe social anxiety problem, so being out in a public place makes me anxious, but there's nothing about the doctor's office in particular that's upsetting for me. I usually feel more calm once I'm in the examining room than I feel before I go because I know I'll be taken care of.
0.285700	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the thought of them finding something that could lead to a terminal diagnosis such as cancer. I do smoke cigarettes (about a pack a day) so sometimes I worry that something would be found to indicate the need for more testing. Uncertainty makes me nervous if it's for something that could potentially be serious. I am generally not anxious or worried when going to the doctor's office though. 
0.500000	The thing that makes me the most anxious is that they will diagnose me with something worse than what I expect.  Also, I sometimes worry they will notice something irregular that I didn't notice on my own, such as a tumor or heart conditions like high blood pressure.
0.285700	A long wait makes me feel anxious.  If the doctor were to suggest a test that I was not expecting I would be worried.
0.595200	I just do not like to go the doctor. I worry that the doctor might find something that is wrong or tell me something that I do not want to hear. I worry that my test results might not bge good.
0.523800	"One incident stands out from my 67 years - my current physician said ""we"" needed to check my heart again. Turns out I had a murmur. Subsequent tests revealed a mitral valve problem, which will be corrected via robotic surgery. That was scary for me and still is as the surgery has not been scheduled. Generally, I am somewhat apprehensive concerning new complaints (e.g, a mole). Part of my anxiety is related to having seen family members suffer with various diseases. For example, my father died of cancer at age 40 (I was 11). My mind tends to go to ""cancer"" when I have an otherwise unexplained pain. Generally, however, I find the typical examination to be quite routine and not anxiety inducing (except in the circumstances i have outlined above)."
0.833300	When visiting the doctor's office, I am afraid that I may get some news that could be very bad. I am also afraid that I may have not been following the doctor's orders as I should and he may be upset with me. I am also afraid of the costs that may be incurred.  I am also afraid of needles so the thought of a shot is upsetting. 
0.619000	I feel concerned and worried that I might receive bad news when I go to to the doctor. I feel this way even when I have no reason to feel this way.
0.190500	I feel most anxious when I have to wait a long time after a blood test or x-ray or similar tests. I also feel very anxious when the doctor seems to be in thoughts when I am sitting in front of him. I am also anxious when what the doctors says is not clear to me or he talks in a very complicated way.
0.857100	I worry that the cancer in my eye is active again.  I worry that the doctor is going to tell me that i need my eye out.  I worry that the cancer will spread...even though it was small and i had radiation treatment to hopefully correct it. I worry that my family will fall apart if something re-occurs in my body.  I wonder that the doctor will tell me that I need more treatment and that it's not over
0.714300	You just never know what is going to be found out. I have a lot of iffy family history that makes me nervous so I always dread going to the doctor
0.142900	i just hope that there is nothing wrong with me and hearing everything is all good that make me feel happy
0.619000	im afraid they will tell me something bad or tell me that im unhealthy because of my weight or vitals
0.142900	Getting blood work because my veins are not good. I hate that I may get stuck 4 or more times in order to get blood done. 
0.714300	Well, seeing a new doctor is unnerving. Especially if you've ever had a bad experience with a doctor. Also, feeling like your needs may not be met or like there is something unexpectedly wrong with you makes you feel anxious or worried. 
0.523800	Well, I don't want any bad news. Also, I just feel like I want to get it over with. I feel as if I am very rushed.
0.619000	That I will get bad news.   That the doctor will tell me something bad about my health.  I also worry that I will have to undergo more tests or treatments.
0.357100	If I have maybe a bump or an ailment which I kind of worry if it's something more. The head games you play with yourself where you try to play doctor but really your brain just goes to worst case scenarios. 
0.761900	I feel anxious when I got to the doctor because sometimes im not sure what they will tell me. I get worried because they could tell me im dying and there is nothing that they can do about it and that its too far gone, or they could misdiagnose me and then I could die from getting treatment that I dont even need. 
0.190500	Not knowing why I feel the way I am and is it a really problem or just I need to keep a better check on myself
0.714300	I am worried that they are going to tell me I have some huge problem and then judge me for it. Or that they may just say I do so they can make money. Or make me feel uncomfortable about myself. I am a very private person. The best case scenario is that I go in they say I have a clean bill of health and I just paid them for that. 
0.881000	Expenses are a big part of it, but I also don't feel very thrilled about finding out what may be wrong with me either.  Plus, my injury made me feel very useless, I couldn't work or do a lot of other things and those feelings sort of colored all of the experiences that I had at the time if that makes any sense.
0.333300	that i cant afford it or im going to have something keeping me off work too long. the wait also makes me anxious.

0.381000	because i am not sure if i will ever get better an i tell the dr iwnt to get better but he says its a long journey
0.928600	I am anxious that the doctor visit will end up costing a lot of money. Sometimes I think that ignorance is bliss and I would rather not know if something is wrong. If you look hard enough something will always be less than perfect.
0.547600	i'm always anxious about results and i hate having to wait. the wait always makes me worry more and i'm the type of person that usually thinks the worst when something comes up
0.261900	Most of the time it is the wait to see the doctor.  The sitting to get back into the office then the waiting once I do get into the examining room.  I worry that something new may be needed that will cause an extra charge. So all in all I would say waiting and money.
0.523800	What makes me feel most anxious is not know if something serious is wrong. Also, there are worries about medical coverage and insurance. Costs of medical treatment also make me anxious.
0.690500	I hate stepping on the scale and I hate to be partially naked in front of people I don't know. I'm also always a little nervous that the small thing I mention just in case, could turn out to be something big and a bad diagnosis. 
0.571400	I am a breast cancer survivor so I am always anxious before any doctor appointment now. I feel like I would rather not go and not risk getting anymore surprise bad news. This usually occurs with blood testing or any other types of medical tests. I felt fine before I was diagnosed so I know that there is a chance to feel good and not know something is wrong inside. It will probably make me feel this way for the rest of my life.
0.500000	I am most anxious or worried about that  there is something unexpected that I  didn't think could be a concern.  I would be worried that there would be many tests investigate further.
0.333300	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office for something that is not routine (outside of my regular appointments). It is the unknown that I worry about.
0.761900	The biggest fear is that something very bad will be discovered. I worry about going for what seems like a relatively normal ache or pain and finding out I have some deadly or crippling disease. No one wants to hear their upset stomach is stomach cancer. Finances can also be worrisome. I am always nervous I will need to get expensive prescriptions or procedures I did not anticipate.
0.761900	The thing that really bothers me about going to the doctor is that he will order another MRI on my back again. I had a frightening extreme case of claustraphobia one time a year ago in a very small MRI machine and I am afraid that I will experience that again.
0.976200	I'm and anxious and worried that I may have a fatal disease. Also, my blood pressure always rises when she first comes into the room. She says it's a phenom called white coat syndrome. I also hate having my weight taken because I am fearful that I have gained too many pounds and will have to go on a diet. 
0.571400	There is always the possibility of finding out something is really wrong or that something is going to be extremity difficult to treat. 
0.595200	When I have to have blood drawn or put through other tests to confirm or deny diagnoses. That is very stressful because I have to wait for results and while I am getting my blood drawn most phlebotomist do not know what they are doing
0.142900	There is really nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried. The only thing i do not like is waiting. I am not overly cmnfrotable around sick strangers. I get a little uptight when everyone is coughing and sneezing and the room seems to get smaller. Again I have no worries at the DR other than waiting.
0.714300	When I visit a doctor's office I feel most worried when his or her expression is worried and when he or she can't explain exactly what is going on.
0.357100	I am a very reserved person and being examined, even by someone I trust, feels somewhat invading.  I also am thinking about whether the exam will produce any negative findings such as high blood pressure or less than favorable results with any bloodwork that has been done.  I go in trying to relax and talking to myself in a soothing way but it usually just makes me more tense.  
0.166700	Mostly about pain.  If I know that a shot or some test like bloodwork is required, I do not like it.  It's not enough to make me avoid them but it does add to my slight worry.  
0.142900	I am always completely relaxed when I go to visit my doctor's office. He is very friendly and his staff always puts me at ease.
0.357100	I typically feel anxious. I think the only thing that ever worries me is if I think that something is wrong and I am worried about what treatment might be recommended or potential side effects. I am also sometimes worried when I know that I am going to have something painful done
0.619000	"Anxiety is two-pronged, in this case: first, that the doctor may ""find something"" in my results, and second, the fact that he or she might not actually be correct about those findings. Doctors, again, are only human, and prone to mistakes or oversights. This makes all of their claims at least somewhat suspect. "
0.381000	I am generally not too anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because of the strong relationship I have with my physician. What would make me most anxious is if I'm seeing the doctor for an ongoing illness that is severe and am dreading a diagnosis of a major disease/cancer. 
0.357100	I really don't care much anymore. I am 69, have lived a full life, and I fully expect my health to deteriorate and I am capable of accepting that. The only thing that makes me close to anxious about visiting the doctor are painful shots, but I can handle it. 
0.595200	I wonder at what halfassed shit they are going to try and push on to me. The place I go is a little hick clinic. Nice enough people for around here but not well educated enough to suit me.
0.857100	When I go to my doctor's office for a check up, I am always anxious that my blood tests will show that something is wrong. I tested in the pre-diabetic range last time I went, so this is a worry for me right now.
0.619000	Not knowing what the outcome will be and it there has to be something done how bad will it hurt and how long will it take to heal.
0.547600	I feel that a doctor is reacting to my symptoms but rarely cares to work on discovering what is causing it. They are more inclined to just hand me a prescription and send me on my way.
0.881000	I feel anxious that I won't get the right diagnosis or that the doctor won't tell me preventative or natural methods to my health issues.  I don't just want a drug.  I want to know how to prevent my condition from getting worse and what natural steps I can take for my health before taking a drug.
0.809500	When it's an issue that potentially requires more than a simple solution to it makes me feel concerned heavily thinking of what may be options or what could be the potential outcome of everything. There are times when I've become overly worrisome as to what could be happening to my health or whether or not these signs are going in line with what I may be thinking is the issue at hand. 
0.809500	It's ultimately the fear of the unknown. I could be walking around unknowingly with a disease that could kill me and not find out until it's too late.  
0.595200	Im anxious when I go to the doctor sometimes because I dont know what to expect when I go there. In the back of my head I feel like everything is going to be fine but you never know.
0.619000	"I'm not talking about my primary physician. The NP that I use is awesome. I'm thinking about the orthopedic Doc that I see because of a broken arm. I've seen him for 2 years and I get butterflies in my tummy every time. He is so quick when he talks to me, doesn't listen to me and talks ""over"" me. I always go in worried about what he is going to say. "
0.785700	I'm afraid they're going to point out a medical problem that may be damaging to me. I'm unsure whether or not I can trust them to make the right diagnosis and prescribe what I need. 
0.642900	Typically I feel that way when Iâm having a basic procedure done and routine exam. Not sure why because itâs not the Dr. 
0.285700	I feel anxious most to find out my condition. I get nervous to see my results, more than how the doctor views me. 
0.976200	I get really anxious about all aspects of visiting a doctor's office. I'm usually very nervous before I even get there. I dread getting weighed. I'm always worried that they will find something seriously wrong with me, even if I'm just there for a minor illness or an annual physical. 
0.428600	What makes me nervous about being at the doctor's office is being around people who I think are sick.  I'm afraid I will get sick just by being there. 
0.261900	I will have to fight to get the doctor to acknowledge I'm a human being and listen to me. He never has time to actually listen. He hops on the first thing he sees on his phone and writes a prescription. That's worrisome for me. I know I will not get good treatment unless what I have is common and everyone is treated the same.
0.333300	I am getting to an age where cancer becomes more prevalent and also because of family history. I am certain that i will receive the proper care and support from my health care provider and family, but it is still an unknown concern.
0.142900	What makes me the most worried when visiting the doctors office is finding out if I have a heath related problem that is not good for me. 
0.261900	The prospect of pain or experiencing something physically uncomfortable - having a boil lanced, or a skin biopsy taken. 
0.190500	I am not usually worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I do get anxious waiting for test results. I hate the anticipation of having to wonder how my blood work is going to turn out, and if I have anything I need to be concerned with. My family has a large history of cancer, so I constantly worry about developing it. 
0.738100	Being told that something is severely wrong with me. I just had this happen recently when I went for a physical and ANS turned up positive (auto immune issue). I still have to go to another lab for a more detailed test and I've been putting it off since I kind of dread it, plus, it's is a hassle. I'm also always uneasy when I'm getting examined I don't have a specific reason, I just don't like it. I also hate getting undressed and having the whole staff in and out and you are sitting there naked in a paper gown. 
0.714300	"The smell of a hospital/doctors office immediately gets me anxious. Moreso however, I almost expect them to say something is wrong (whether or not I have reason to think there is), and either ready injections or prescribe medications. It's primarily the thought of ""what if something is wrong"" and the outcome of it."
0.595200	I feel anxious because of the waiting room and germs (I am a bit of a germophobia and am afraid I might contract an illness while waiting). I also get worried about maybe being pinpointed from the doctor if I didn't follow there instructiosn to the t
0.904800	First of all if there will be something seriously wrong with me. Secondly, if there is something seriously wrong with me and the doctor doesn't realize it because she is rushing through so she can move on to the next patient. Just her getting the diagnoses wrong in general. 
0.619000	First of all coming to appointment on time and waiting for up to an hour for the doctor. Then expectation of lack of details after exam.
0.357100	Anxious to see what they are going to say. Because no one or Doctor can know your body better than you. Are Bodies give us signs if something is wrong.
0.523800	Thinking that he will find something that is wrong that I didn't know about. That there will be something major that will affect my life.
0.476200	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most worried about hearing bad news. The moments leading up to the visit itself is most nerve-racking. 
0.142900	What makes me anxious is that my doctor finds something really wrong with me. That would be one of my biggest fears, and to be honest is what makes it harder for me to get a check up from my doctor. Though my doctor does his best to make me feel that I am as comfortable that I can be. No one really wants to hear any type of bad news. Once I hear that everything is fine with my health from my doctor then that is when all of my anxiety disappear. That is what worry about the most.
0.357100	I worry the doctor will not listen appropriately.  I worry that I'll be sitting alone for a long period of time waiting with only a paper on.  I worry that I haven't told the whole truth inadvertently.  
0.214300	The thing that I'm the most worried about is having to get extra things done like labs where they take blood or running tests because my insurance doesn't cover squat so I have to pay for everything out of pocket.
0.285700	The lobbies and the wait time, It takes way too long and people usually have their kids running around being obnoxious.
0.857100	Not knowing what the doctor is going to say or what the test results are going to be.  Needles and blood make me nervous
0.738100	I am greatly uncomfortable getting blood drawn. I immediately get very fearful of this once I step into the doctors office. It's uncomfortable to have someone touch you and to not have clothes on, etc.
0.761900	I worry about getting weighed and having my blood pressure taken.  I also worry of course about them finding something bad
0.428600	I feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office because I'm fearful that something is wrong that I didn't know about and I'm scared how I will react
0.261900	I might get kind or nervous that i might have something really bad or dangerous to my body and my mind. Nothing else but that. 
0.142900	Actually, I'm not worried when visiting my primary care physician. On occasion, I have been concerned when visiting a specialist regarding what they might find wrong but that is short-lived as I am always determined to approach whatever issue by working with the physician to resolve it.
0.285700	I don't usually feel this way. If I were to be anxious, it would be for a painful test or procedure. 
0.690500	Mostly, I'm worried about whatever situation made me visit the doctor. I don't visit the doctor unless I feel I have a serious problem that won't go away on its own and it will need some medical treatment. This is a very rare occurrance though.
0.642900	Always wonder if maybe he has some bad news after giving his examinations. Also going to a doctor is rare so i'm a bit nervous just interacting with him. If i go to the doctor it is generally because of some problem so i worry about that too.
0.452400	That I may or may not have a serious health confliction and in having one my doctor will look down on me and judge me. I am also afraid about how much everything will cost me in the end
0.261900	I always get a little worried something will be wrong. My health is very important to me so I get anxious about it.
0.523800	About finding out if I had some kind of eating disorder. Also if maybe the reason I was losing weight was that of something that could not be explained what so ever. Also, I was worried that if I had some kind of disorder, what would the woman that I love say about that?
0.761900	I think that the things hat makes me the most anxious is just not knowing what to expect.  I often start to imagine the worst situations, like the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me and I let my imagination get the best of me.  I also tend to think that procedures and exams are going to be more uncomfortable than they actually are.
0.690500	That the problem is much worse than what was anticipated.  In general medical office or hospitals give me anxiety, which compounds the issue of worry and anxiousness.
0.595200	I guess I just do not want to hear any negative information. Being in a doctors office feels a little cold and sterile. The environment encourages you to feel nervous and a little jittery. 
0.476200	"I don't feel overly anxious or worried, it's more like a small bit of ""what if I'm really sick"" or the doctor finds something abnormal. "
0.428600	I get a little nervous about judgement maybe. Like they'll think Im a hypochondriac if I tell them everything I need help with. I don't like the smell of the place, that alcohol smell. I don't like people touching me. I don't like how you're shoved around like cattle into different rooms. I don't like the front office at doctor's office, they are usually cold and sterile. Just say hello to a patient would be nice. LOL
0.761900	I hate sitting in the waiting room. It is noisy, dirty, and loud with patients, kids and the TVs blasting. The waiting room is not conducive to people who have mental disorders. Then when I am answering the basic, every visit questions (like do I feel like hurting myself or others) I feel anxious that he is not listening or caring how I really feel unless I answer opposite of what I know the correct answer is. He barely looks at me when talking to me and has used another patient's name when writing my prescriptions. I don't trust him nor do I even like him. I want to go back to my other doctor.
0.142900	What makes me the most anxious is that I'm afraid my kids might catch a bug and get sick. Especially my middle son who has a PICC line so he can get sick very easily.
0.500000	The times when I don't know what's wrong with me, or how much it's going to cost. Also if I don't know what to do after the doctor leaves the room (do I wait for a nurse? do I go to the checkout desk? do I just leave?)
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting the doctor's office is my fear of social interactions.
0.571400	who knows, there are so many symptoms that can be said to be related to all kinds of diseases, nobody wants to let some body else tell them that they have diseases
0.285700	Not getting the results back quickly is what makes me anxious when going to the doctor or if she can't give me an answer right away and has to rely on lab results instead.
0.571400	I worry mainly weather or not i have money to pay for the copay and then if my insurance is going to cover the rest. Insurance companies are so weird you never know what they are going to cover and finances are always my biggest stressor. 
0.785700	I get anxious when visited the doctor because I'm afraid of what they might find and that it will be bad news.
0.452400	I'm worried about the doctor telling me something is wrong with me or I'm anxious about the doctor seeing my penis because I've never had a woman look at it in my entire adult life and I feel like The 40 Year Old Virgin all the time regarding my lack of proficiency with the opposite sex.
0.452400	I don't like sitting around in the waiting room not know the people there nor knowing what is going to happen in the doctors office. Uncertainty is not my strong point. I like to know what is going to happen. I understand that can't always be the case but I like to eliminate variables. 
0.761900	I lost my mom to a stroke a few years ago so I am now anxious whenever I visit a doctor, I was not prior to suddenly losing my mother. I smoke (less then half a pack of cigarettes a day) and I know the negative impacts this can have on my health so I am always worried. Also my cousin's 18 year old son was just diagnosed with Cancer so I am now aware that anything can happen. 
0.785700	I'm always worried he will find something wrong with me either during exam or with bloodwork. I get anxious getting called in like I've failed the test.
0.857100	I only get to die once an that is all my life can be.  Most people seem bad at accepting this let alone doing something to make it better.  I dislike the mind and the things we've done with them ever more.  Trying to believe someone is professional vested in myself getting an improved life seems beyond any idea of lies I could ever believe with any safety so I approach all medical professionals as near enemies.
0.833300	I might be diagnosed with something horrible. I may need to have further examinations. I may be billed a very high amount.
0.761900	I'm a worrier, always have been, so seeing a doctor, even for a regular checkup, is nerve-wracking to me. I always think beforehand that the doctor will find something wrong or need to do a followup on something that's worrying to him. I tend to get myself worked up before doctor appointments, but that's just my personality.
0.666700	I always feel slightly uncomfortable being examined, they may be more to do with my personal insecurities than with the doctor or the exam itself.
0.976200	I can't stand to be touched. I have PTSD from being raped and I absolutely hate when they want to do a gyn exam. I am never made to feel like this is okay. When I went to the county clinic for birth control they told me I couldn't have birth control until I allowed them to examine me even though I have never had sex other than being raped and I was hysterically crying. I just wanted to get birth control because I'm getting married and want to be prepared but I ended up leaving with nothing and felt so ashamed.
0.738100	I usually worry that they will find something wrong with me that is serious. I tend to assume the worst. I look to them to calm me down and help me see that chances are good it's nothing serious.
0.714300	I hope they dont find something wrong with me I wasn't expecting.  I hope they have the answers I need
0.619000	My biggest fear is getting blood taken, so I'm always petrified I'm going to have to have it done. It causes me a great amount of stress. Sometimes I'm worried I might be diagnosed with something I had no idea I had.
1.000000	I just have horrible white coat syndrome. We went to the doctor when we were little only if we were terribly ill. I think as a result, I have a profound fear of all medical surroundings. 
0.714300	Not really that I have some condition to where I'm going to die. Sometimes when the doctor is the opposite sex as me it sucks and I hold things back. Some times when it is clear the doctor isn't listening to me I get upset. And most of the time they will judge you and assume things with out knowing for sure. 
0.285700	I hate everything to do with getting any medical thing done.  It makes me feel sick just being there.  The worst by far is getting blood drawn.  I hate it so much and it makes me extremely anxious.
0.738100	I am always worried that something is going to be really wrong and also they it will cost a lot of money. 
0.571400	Just the act of going there.  The uncertainty of what could possibly happen and what the next steps would be.
0.547600	I get nervous around doctors. I am afraid they might find something really bad about me or it might cost a lot of money. I do not want to have to do any procedures or anything or they might be just judging me by my health, as a person not just a doctor. 
0.690500	What they are going to say. What they are going to find. The outlook. The coldness of the doctor. Having to explain things to the doctor. Them not listening. 
0.738100	I'll answer with another question.  How does one feel when they take their car to the mechanic.  its a similar type of anxiety to me.
0.809500	Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.
0.738100	Being at the doctors makes me anxious and worried because I dont know what he's going to tell me.  I dont know if something seriously could be wrong with me or not.
0.595200	I think the thing that makes me most anxious is whether something is really wrong or not when I visit my PCP. If I have to wait for results, that is the worse for me. Not knowing is sometimes worrisome and makes me anxious because of the wait.
0.452400	I think like most other people I'm most worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I've been very lucky with my health, and would like to stay that way so whenever I go for a checkup there's always a little bit of anxiousness that I might have some disease or something that I don't know about.
0.690500	Finding out I have a condition that cannot be treated or that is crazy expensive. I have issues with my own mortality, so anything that might be cancer always freaks me out.
0.285700	There is actually not much that scares me. I know I have a light heart condition and moderate CAPD. But I know also that I have quality healthcare and that this healthcare is available when I need it. I have regular check-ups and have cardiac training 3 times per week.
0.285700	Finding out that my I might have inherited a health problem from a family member during a check up or analysis, that is always a major concern and cause for nervousness when booking a check up.
0.333300	I think of the worst possible situations and get worried about being diagnosed with something bad. I am usually able to get those thoughts out of my head though.
0.857100	I just am an anxious person.  I don't like the doctor's office and try to avoid it when possible.  I go when needed though and usually good comes of it.  I just get so nervous that something might be wrong or that they're judging me.
0.309500	My biggest concern is that I will not be able to describe my symptoms clearly enough, or remember all the relevant bits, in order to convey the full picture to my GP. If I do a good job of explaining my symptoms, then I feel she does a good job of piecing the info together and coming up with options for me.
0.333300	There's not really alot that would make me worried about actually seeing the doctor. If anything I would be the most worried about why I am going to the doctor. If I dont know what is going on and it is something that has been bothering me, it more about the unknown. The other thing I would be nervous about is if I have to go to the doctor last minute and I have to see another doctor that I havent seen before. When you see your regular doctor there is already some trust there so seeing someone else doesnt feel right to me and it is hard to trust them because they are not my doctor. Lastly, when I go for my yearly exam it just makes me nervous because of the discomfort. 
0.285700	The number one thing would be the discovery of something that is asymptomatic. I'm sixty years of age and feel pretty good. So I guess any anxiety I might feel would be tied into discovering an issue that I had not planned on.
0.452400	I hate the unknown, this is what causes so much anxiety when I go to the doctor.  My doctor actually tries to help the anxious feelings since she knows how I feel when I go.  I don't like surprises so my anxiety comes from not knowing what is going on or what will be done about it.  I wish I didn't feel this way so I wouldn't be so uncomfortable about going.
0.381000	I feel anxious or worried based upon whether my doctor will discover an issue with my health. This means that I will have to deal with the necessary research to determine if my health will require more attention as well as achieve the necessary footing to converse with my doctor on the subject of my health.
0.642900	With my condition, I have seen alot of doctors. But still am a little nervous going to appointments. Just removing your clothes and having someone poking around. I think it's also the unknown. 
0.285700	The wait time makes me anxious. And having multiple ppl to interact with that could possibly be sick. 
1.000000	I'm always worried that something terrible will be found, especially now that I'm getting old. I also worry that something will be misdiagnosed, sending me in a long spiral of unpleasant tests and more appointments that lasts for weeks. Since I don't fully trust doctors, I also don't trust them to cure me if something terrible is wrong.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious when I visit a doctor's office.  I am calm and looking ahead at what I will learn about the doctor and my health.
0.523800	I am always afraid that they will want to draw blood from me.  I have a very severe phobia of needles and I almost always pass out.  It's embarrassing and I always have to explain myself before they start the process.  I usually tell them it's probably safer for everyone if they let me lay down somewhere while they are taking the blood.  I have hit the floor several times and hurt myself after passing out.  It's a terrible thing to live with.  
0.642900	I feel anxious when I am at the doctor's office because, even though I am healthy, there is always a chance that a medical problem could be discovered.
0.666700	Social interactions in general are a big thing for me. I am not very good at handling them without some form of anxiety cropping up. I also feel that going into the office is like going into the unkown where I might find anything to be wrong with me that could change my life.
0.142900	I am afraid they might find something that is out of the ordinary. The daunting feeling of fear is what is the most worrying. 
0.142900	The only time i feel anxious is when i go for my annual mammogram.  Now that i get the digital kind its not as bad. I still get some anxiety. Any other time i go to dr i feel no anxiety. 
0.785700	The things that make me feel most anxious at the doctor's office are a) my ability to communicate clearly the symptoms I am experiencing and how often I experience them and b) describing intimate or personal issues with female nurses and doctors.  I am far more comfortable with male doctors or nurses.
0.619000	I am always nervous that something will be wrong with me. I get nervous sitting in the waiting room because I imagine whatever symptoms I am experiencing could be a serious illness. I worry about the doctor not saying much because they get concerned while examining me.
0.547600	Test results. I have a few issues with my blood sugar and A1C, so I'm always a little anxious about what they will say about my sugars and my weight. I do not want to have insulin at any point in my life, so I've been working on controlling sugars without it. Sometimes I succeed, but not always. And a lot of doctors don't approve of the diet I'm using(ketogenic), unless they have a higher understanding of nutrition.
0.261900	I am most anxious that i will get bad new at the doctor such as high blood pressure or something else going wrong. I usually do not have any issues once i am there but the lead up to going to the doctor makes me very anxious and worried. 
0.761900	I am afraid I'll have some horrible disease or find out that my doctor cannot help me in a way that will improve my well being. It feels tense because I don't know what to expect and am also afraid of being judged.
0.142900	Nothing , I selected nothing on the survey because it's true. I feel calm and fine in the doctors office. I have never been through a real medical scare to make me feel otherwise. 
0.357100	I always get anxious about blood work results. I never really get bad results but I sill worry a bit. My blood pressure is always a little high when I go in but this is a normal thing for me.
0.857100	I get extremely nervous and upset with every doctors visit that I have. Iâm always worried that something worse is gonna be found out or even just something new that could potentially be bad. I hate all the tests and blood work and just initially everything about it. I canât wait to get it over and done with and get back out of the office. Iâve always been this way and I suppose itâll never change. Even if it is just a simple checkup or something like that my heart still races and I get very anxious and nervous.
0.666700	Mainly that something will be wrong, when I go for the next check up, I'm getting older and I smoke and this is around the age when my mother started to have medical problems.
0.571400	The most anxious feelings are brought on by the fear of what might be wrong with me. In addition anxiety also builds when trying to decide how I am going to describe my issues to my doctor.
0.595200	It has nothing to do with my doctor herself, or her staff. I'm just not a huge fan of sitting in waiting rooms, and I feel like that tends to cause my heart rate to rise and then for me to just get nervous about being there in general. I feel like hospitals and doctor's offices just have a certain smell to them that I'll never fully get used to. My main issue with my health is also having a history of anxiety disorders, so that definitely plays a huge roll in how I feel about doctor's visits. I think that I work myself up thinking about the unknown, and fearing that something will be wrong, even when I'm just having a routing checkup and no reason to believe that something is actually wrong.
1.000000	I have never been a health-minded individual and have been obese most of my life. I become defensive when I feel judged regarding my health. I am deeply worried about my health but much more afraid of finding out that something is seriously wrong.
0.642900	I always feel like my doctor doesn't want to be there and would rather be doing anything else, besides working.  I always feel like I am a burden and not someone who should be there because I deserve to be there.  I find my doctor is always on me about something.  I always feel like when I am asked a question, regardless of my answer, the doctor will interject something else I should do instead of any positive feedback.
0.404800	It is an irrational emotion that sometimes comes up, but not always.  I like to have the experience behind me each year.  As I have aged, this has been the case, for when I was young, I seldom saw a physician, except once for a gall bladder attack due to which, the gall bladder was removed. That period was somewhat anxious until over.  But that was 25 years ago. 
0.428600	Although I'm seldom there because of sickness, there is always the possibility they'll discover something wrong.  That worry naturally increases with aging.
0.452400	What would make me feel anxious or worried is the unknown. Primarily aside from yearly check ups the reason for going to the doctor would because there is somethingwrong with my body. So the not know what is going on would make feel uneasy.
1.000000	Not knowing what is wrong with me or having the doctor or nurses find out additional problems that I had no idea about.
0.666700	I feel my doctor my find something horribly wrong with me during an examination or he might give me bad news. General anxiety at being examined, poked, and prodded, its a very intimate interaction that doesn't happen often.
0.166700	I am just a worrier in general its my personality. At the doctor's office all that worries me is getting sick from touching something as I feel there are a lot of germs in these places.
0.381000	The fear of hearing some kind of bad news. Even if it's just a routine check-up, I'm always fearing the worst in terms of hearing bad news. The entire atmosphere at a doctor's office gives me that vibe. 
0.238100	Just having to have a physical, Other than that i do not mind going to the doctor's office as i generally only go for reason i am aware of..
0.738100	As a female I'm used to the fact that a lot of doctors will tell women that whatever is wrong with them is because of hormones or stress, and so I worry that they're going to miss something important. Particularly since doctors are far more interested in a woman's privates than her heart (annual heart scans aren't in vogue, but they'll nag for a pap) when heart attacks are one of the top killers of women. The problem is, you never know if you got a good doctor or not until you've seen him/her, so I'm always anxious thinking I might be going through the embarrassment and cost of seeing this person that I might never want to go back to for my care. Then you have to start all over again with a different doctor, with the same worries. 
0.357100	I am worried that they may find some problem that will require further surgeries and testing. Not that the doctor is unqualified.
0.666700	I think I get anxious just because it is usually for an acute problem, so it was not something I had scheduled. It ends up making me rebalance my board study schedule which makes me anxious. 
0.142900	I really don't have those feelings.  I guess when a new issue comes up  there might be a thought that it could be something bad and incurable but I don't dwell on things like that.
0.714300	I am confident that I do not currently have major health issues, but I do struggle with extreme pain from a root cause that is not serious (life threatening). I get anxious when going to the doctor because my pain issues get dismissed due to my relative good health otherwise. I worry that my problem will never get solved and that going to the doctor is a waste of my time and money. 
0.428600	The one thing that causes me to be anxious or worried is that I sometimes put off going to the doctor over aches and pains and I am afraid he will find something majorly wrong with me. 
0.238100	If im super sick or think something may be wrong then seeing the doctor and getting that either confirmed or not is stressful
0.857100	firstly i don't like being poked and looked over. secondly the fear of having a serious disease is always in the back of my mind when visiting the doctor. lastly it's also just the fear of not having control of the situation. 
0.857100	I am always concerned about finding out information that yields a high likelihood of having a terminal type illness or chronic condition.  I guess I openly feel like I have a chronic condition which cannot be helped without surgery and/or medication.  Both of these alternatives really cause worry for me.  I do not like medication at all.  I feel that the side effects associated with them increase the problems associated with my health. Furthermore, I know any surgery can turn more problematic so I would say it is the uncertainty that makes me most anxious.
0.714300	Usually when I'm anxious for a Dr. visit it's when I'm feeling real bad and expecting the worst. In those cases it's always been less severe than I imagined which is a good thing.
0.833300	That they won't believe me. Or the that the next step in my treatment will be scheduled too far out and I have to wait a month to have a test done.
0.285700	I do not feel anxious or worried at my doctor office. I feel like my doctors office has everything under control and makes everything as calming and relaxing as possible.
0.190500	The doctors office has always been a place that is scary to me. It is just the thought of the unknown, because we have all heard stories about the people who just go in for a normal check up and find something terribly wrong or something of that nature, and plus I had to get a series of painful shots when I was younger, so my perception of the doctor's office and hospitals has never been very good, although it has gotten better. It is more the place itself, and the unknown factor that worries me than anything that my doctor or any other physician does.
0.142900	I wouldn't call what I feel when I visit a doctor's office either anxious or worried.  It's more like frustrated and indignant.  Especially when I'm on time and they are not.  I don't spend much time anxious or worried in general - why should a doctor's office be any different?  It is what it is - worry never helps.
0.619000	I am worried about something being wrong that would lead to expensive testing and treatments. I also worry about catching the flu from being around sick people in the waiting room.
0.285700	I am worried that the diagnosis will be worse than I initially thought. Although unlikely and Im not a hypochondriac, still, a small part of me feels very anxious about a bad diagnosis. 
0.261900	"I feel worried when they see something of concern on my blood work and want to redo it.  Blood work is very telling so it makes me extremely nervous if something looks ""off"" to my doctor."
0.690500	I am most anxious and worried when going to the doctors office because I am anxious that something will be wrong. There are several conditions that run in my family, like diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure and more.  Each time I go to the doctor, even for a routine physical, I am always anxious that this will be the time we find out that I have those conditions too.  I do not like taking prescriptions and therefore do not want to have to start taking them for life. 
0.571400	I would feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I am injured and worry an exam may cause more pain or if I feel there is something really unusual about my symptoms and something could be seriously wrong. Regular visits do not cause me concern.
0.285700	I don't have any anxiety when I go to the doctors office.  I usually only make appointments when necessary so I don't feel that anyone's time is wasted.  the only thing that really bugs me is when I have to wait a long time without any feedback from the front office staff.  I know that emergencies come up which throws the schedules off, but I believe that keeping patients informed is important.  If you don't let them know about a schedule change you are basically saying that their time isn't as valuable as someone else's.  so I guess this is my anxiety issue when going to the doctor. 
0.928600	I'm always treated like an unnecessary burden that they have to rush through dealing with.  I never feel like I can ask what I need to ask.
0.642900	I get worried that I will receive bad news in regards to a a problem that I have going on and I hope it turns out for the best
0.404800	What usually makes me nervous about going to the doctor's office is when there's something that i feel is wrong with me that's beyond a regular checkup. It doesn't really have anything to do with the doctor since it's mostly the situation that got me in to the office to begin with. But when there is something worse than usual, then everything from the wait in the waiting room and the patient room to just talking to the doctor/nurse is nervewracking
0.142900	I don't. This doesn't apply to me. I don't go in feeling nervous or anxious when going to the my doctors.
0.714300	I am always a bit uneasy going to the doctor.  I worry that he is going to find something wrong with me.  I'd almost rather not know.
0.500000	I am getting older, and I fear that a condition is in the works that I do not know about.  I fear that something is happening right now that I won't be able to bounce back from.  
0.476200	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I have symptoms, or am suffering from an illness and have no idea what it is.  If my symptoms are extreme, sometimes I'm anxious or worried.
0.142900	I'm actually never really worried as although I don't get sick or have to go to the doctor's office often, I am confident that they will figure out the issue and get me back on track health wise, in a good amount of time. 
0.738100	What makes me the most worried is if it's something serious or not. I personally don't have health insurance so anything serious would also probably cost me a lot of money out of pocket. This is particularly worrisome as my personal income isn't that high either.
0.285700	The only thing that would make me anxious or worried is the condition that sent me to see the doctor in the first place.  I'm the sort of person who won't go to see a doctor unless I think there is something seriously wrong.  Not serious in the sense that I might think something life threatening but serious in the sense that it's something my body's defense system seems to be incapable of taking care of on it's own.
0.761900	I think I am just allergic to doctor's offices!  I am one of those people whose  blood pressure goes up when tested in the doc's office.  I look at the trays of sharp instruments lying in wait on the counters and I am uneasy!  I have a vivid imagination.  I am anxious about any invasive tests, about possible pain, about possible bad news, esp. as I get older and older.  I have learned to trust my doctor, and as I have reached the age just this year when my yearly physical exam does not have to include a gyn exam, I am much more relaxed.  
0.809500	The thought of what could be found or diagnosed. I have not had much health scares up to this point but I am aware I am getting older and things are bound to happen. Both of my parents are both still living and very healthy for the most part.
0.142900	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I have always been pretty relaxed while I was there.
0.309500	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor is whether or not I will be able to convince them to address all of my concerns rather than just the one or two issues that they feel like addressing. Other than that I have no worries about visiting a doctor because I realize that I'm getting older and I'm not going to live forever.
0.666700	I guess the number one thing is fear that a routine exam or test will uncover something really wrong with me.  Now, to be fair, I am a paranoid hypochondriac.  So any time I get the slightest little pain or perhaps a lump or something, I am convinced it's terminal cancer and I'm going to die in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, that has so far not happened.  So I think it's very important that I have the ability to access proper medical care (in the past I haven't always had the access)  to go and get checked out on a regular basis, more for my own mental peace of mind than because there is something actually really wrong with me.  Other than that, sometimes I do worry that a doctor or nurse will be judgmental and make comments to me about certain unhealthy characteristics like my weight or smoking, but that's not nearly as big a concern.
0.285700	I do not  feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am confident that things will go well and that evverything will be fine and dandy after I leave the office.
0.381000	I get most anxious and worried about the bill I will receive. I have an HMO and pay $25 for PCP office visits. However, after my appointment my doctor's office will re-evaluate the co-pay and what was discussed and bill me for items that came up in conversation during an appointment. 
0.738100	I usually feel anxious that they're going to find something wrong with me than is worse than what I though.  If I have a cough, I worry it might be related to the lungs or that they may not be able to get my symptoms under control.  I worry that I'm going to be judged and this all makes me anxious and worried. 
0.452400	There is always the risk that something could be found that was not foreseen, but on the whole this is not how I typically feel since I lead a relatively healthy lifestyle.
0.261900	I just feel anxious because I'm afraid something might be wrong with me. I am afraid I will be told something I don't want to hear. But I do trust my doctor.
0.285700	I don't usually feel anxious or worried. If I do it's usually when I have a rare or odd issue that I am not sure will be diagnosed.
0.309500	I feel anxious if I am having a health issue and worried it could turn out to be something serious.  I make sure I get a thorough explanation when my health issues are being explained to me.
0.357100	I am most anxious or worried about visiting the doctor because one can never know what will be found out about my health. But this stems from the fact that I have largely avoided doctors for most of my life. If I regularly visited a doctor, then perhaps I would be less worried.
0.595200	I feel anxious sometimes because if I need to go the doctor, something is wrong with me.  There concern over the unknown will always lead to a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor.
0.714300	I feel most anxious if a doctor is not open to my full explanation of what my body is doing. Most doctors are too close minded regarding nutritional therapy and so I tend to be skeptical of a doctors quick diagnosis. I know my body the best so I trust my insight more than them.
0.142900	If I have something new that's wrong with me and I'm already concerned, then yes, I am nervous going to the doctor, but it doesn't have anything to do with my physician. It just means I know that something is wrong and I'm nervous to find out what it is.
0.357100	I feel anxious sometimes about telling them what's wrong with me, and wondering if what they can do to help me. 
0.809500	I am worried that he will not believe me when I tell him my symptoms and that I will feel like a foolish old women.
0.809500	I have been for several different exams and what bother me the most is, I usually know what the problem is and so does he but I dont really wanna hear what it is. The few rare times when I dont know what it is, Im worried about cost, and what I will have to do for treatment or if something new is wrong that I will have to deal with. You always have the dread of finding something new, when you think you know what is wrong, doesnt happen very often but when it does, it scares you.
0.333300	The main thing I don't like going through is a breast exam and/or a pelvic exam. I would imagine both of those are slightly uncomfortable for almost all women. I know they have to be done though, so I manage to get through them whenever they are needed.
0.666700	I am concerned that the doctor may inform me that there is something seriously wrong with my health.  I am afraid of finding out about an incurable disease or health issue.
0.904800	Authority figures in general make me feel uneasy, but i hate going to the doctor. i am not sure why, I also hate getting naked in front of anyone who is not my fiance. That is a huge trigger for my anxiety. I don't like being poked and proded or touched.
0.333300	I just don't enjoy people poking and prodding me. Even worse is that you're paying to be poked and prodded. They usually don't seem very confident in what they are doing or why they are doing it, It feels very impersonal almost like you're a car at a mechanics shop and not a living breathing human with thoughts and emotions.
0.738100	I don't like to give details about private issues. The healthcare system seems to be set up as a referral business. The first visit is just to get a patient to go somewhere else.
0.714300	With the doctor I've been using, you just never know what he will come up with. He's friendly at times and other times a real jerk. Also, he divorced his wife and married his nurse. Don't upset the Queen!! 
0.976200	I am most anxious that there will be bad news, or difficult news.  I am also anxious the dr. wonât understand what I am trying to explain.
0.142900	I want to be able to find out what the issue is right away when I go to the dr office. I also would like to avoid a run-around with treatments that would be completely pointless and offer no remedy to whatever reason I had to visit the dr office. I also do NOT like dealing with needles, having my blood taken causes me some anxiety whenever it happens. 
0.500000	Being touched makes me highly uncomfortable and I would rather you not do that, please and thank you.
0.476200	I don't like when she rushes me.  I don't like when she does not listen to my health concerns.  It makes me anxious that something could go wrong that my doctor could simply brush off and overlook.  I often wonder about a mole on my back, which she said was benign just by looking at it.  Meanwhile she is not a dermatologist.  And she then referred me to a dr that had killed my friends father by misdiagnosing him.
0.285700	I am most worried about the cost. I have the very good luck to never have health insurance when I need it, and even when I do it's still a large expense. I rarely feel any kind of anxiety over my health when I'm able to see a doctor, it's when I can't that worries me.
0.142900	I'm most worried about how long it takes.   Generally, going to the doctor's office does not worry me
0.761900	The one thing that makes me feel the most anxious has been a couple times when doctors pushed medications instead of making sure I actually needed it.  If there are major symptoms and they don't take the time to find the source and instead just automatically try and mask a problem I feel very angry and defeated.  I've wasted time and then you have to go somewhere else.
0.190500	That my health isn't what I want it to be and that it's going to be terminal or worse. That's it really
0.428600	Usually a doctor's office is cold and this environment causes me to fell tense. Also I often forget to tell the doctor important symptoms and I become anxious when trying to remember them.
0.285700	I don't really mind going to the doctor it doesn't affect me usually. Unless I'm worried about something, but just going in for a checkup I'm usually fine
0.476200	Unexpected health issues, or issues that seem minor and turn out to be much larger. I am fearful for my health as I get older so having a good examination is really important to me.
0.761900	The great unknown. If I'm in the doctor's office it's because I really need to be there, and I'm usually heading out of the country or returning and something has gone wrong.
0.666700	I'm anxious because you never know what the doctor is going to tell you. For example they could tell you that you will have cancer in the next moment and you wouldn't be prepared for that whatsoever. It is scary.
0.333300	Not being able to know the outcome it what makes me the most anxious worried.  The actual act of being at a doctor's office and talking with a doctor doesn't make anxious or worried, usually.
0.761900	I'm always scared because I have lots of health problems in my family history. I am always scared that something is going to come back bad or a simple ache is going to be so much more than just a simple ache. I am always worried about what they will recommend or what they have to say.
0.571400	I don't feel anything in particular.  Why should I?  I don't know whether or not to trust what they say. So why should I feel anything?
0.690500	I am worried about something being wrong with me that i am not aware of. I am worried about unexpected medical expenses. 
0.619000	Whether or not that i would bleed once I was in the office. The doctor always needs to draw a significant amount of blood, usually until I get dizzy. 
0.785700	Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel.[1] The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch
0.238100	The first thing that makes me anxious is getting on the scale. I dread that more than anything, and also I get very worried about cost because I am self pay.
0.833300	You never truly know what a doctor could tell you. Your body and mind can feel 100% sometimes and the inside of you could be completely destroyed. 
0.976200	The outcome of a diagnosis would be what I fear most. I do not participate in many actual exams, I don not like people touching me. Not even for a shot or checking heart rates. I just get extremely anxious about seeing any DR for fear of bad news.
0.476200	I am mostly anxious or worried because I have little faith in their ability to diagnose my problem. Or show concern by getting to the underlying cause of my problem. Medical costs keep going up and up and yet is seems as if medical care has been drastically declining.
0.452400	Hardly ever but sometimes i will think the doctor is going to tell me that there is something more that is wrong with me.
0.476200	it would be only when my doctor is not there and i would have to deal with another doctor that i don't really trust or know to much 
0.142900	I'm worried about the cost of a prescription or care. Healthcare here in America is very expensive. Right now I'm luckily on my parents' insurance, because I simply cannot afford my own as an individual. Once that time is up, and if I get sick or injured, I'm screwed. One of the biggest causes of bankruptcy in this country is due to healthcare bills.
0.690500	I feel more anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I never know what they may find. It is an uneasy feeling going in and having to wait and see what may possibly be wrong with you. It makes me overall nervous and my blood pressure rises a bit when I go to the doctor's because of fear of the unknown. What also makes me most anxious is the kind of tests they may have to do or if I have to get a shot, or blood drawn.
0.666700	Just afraid that they will find something that is not good. I haven't really taken care of my body from like 12 to 22 using heroin and doing whatever drugs I could get my hands on. Just the past three years I got my life otgether and my health is phenomonal. But I am worried I will have something go wrong with my brain because I have had two traumatic brain injuries. I don't want the doctor to tell me I have brain cancer
0.571400	What makes me feel worried is that they will quickly prescribe meds and will give you no inside depth to how you can truly take care of yourself by keeping your body in an alkaline state to fight off diseases and ailments.
0.642900	I am never sure if my condition will get worse.  I don't want to have a negative report but understand it is a possibility.    I have to live in reality when it comes to the information. 
0.357100	I had a major illness when I was younger, and it took the doctors a long time to find out what was wrong.  I had to have blood drawn on a daily basis for over a month.  To this day I still hate having blood drawn.  I always look away, and just hate when I have people who aren't that competent drawing blood.  I also worry about what hereditary conditions I may have.
0.904800	I am always afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I absolutely fear having something serious and needing surgery or some horrible disease like cancer.  It's terrifying for me to visit even if it's just for a cold.  
0.261900	It's probably a dumb reason, but her hands are very cold. She's a tiny woman and being in a doctor's office all day doesn't help her warm up. She apologizes, but that makes me a little anxious. If I had recently been ill, I also feel a little anxious about my lab results. I don't get many colds or the flu, but when I do I feel very sick. That makes me think there might be some other problem, but so far it's not been very serious. 
0.571400	I guess the uncertainty of your health is what makes me the most anxious. It really worries me that I don't truly know if I'm fully health even If I feel healthy.
0.738100	I don't know what they are going to do to me, if something will be painful, or what the results of any tests might be. I tend to not think about my health too much but then when I go to the doctor suddenly I have to deal with it all
0.571400	I wonder if they will find some kind of health condition I was not aware I had. I also wonder if they will judge or criticize me for things like not getting enough exercise or always eat nutritiously.  
0.761900	I am most worried about examinations which may be physically painful or uncomfortable, as this has necessarily been a common occurrence for me lately. I am also a reserved person, and therefore may feel physically or even emotionally vulnerable in these moments. This is particularly true if my condition is a source of embarrassment to me, such as a urinary tract infection. I may also be anxious about forgetting to ask a clarifying question in the moment, or otherwise missing the opportunity to inform myself or give the doctor helpful information which can lead to more effective treatment.
0.738100	I feel anxious and also worried about what results will come from the doctors evaluation.  Although I know deep in my mind nothing severe should be wrong I also know there is a chance that something may come back that would make my health even worse than it currently is.  
0.571400	Nothing makes me feel anxious more than just having to wait in the waiting room. It seem unnecessary to have an appointment at a certain time then be force to wait another 30 minutes or so. Can be very frustrating when they do this at the office. I get anxious because I could have been doing better things with my time then spending it at a waiting room. This waiting time feeds into my anxiety, but most of the time I feel like I am in the clear, and have no issues I should be worried about since I get tested every three months.
0.142900	The only thing I get worried about is that I am going to forget to tell the Dr. something or not be able to communicate correctly.
0.142900	Obviously there is always that sense of the unknown. That is to say that any normal routine issue can snowball into something much worse. It's impossible to tell with utmost certainty what is happening within our bodies at any given moment but I suppose that's all the more reason we need to take care of ourselves as best as we can.
0.309500	you never know if they might find cancer. You could go to the doctor for something you think is probably minor, but it is actually something really bad
0.190500	I'm worried that they might find something wrong with me. It also makes me anxious being poked and prodded. It is a little uncomfortable. It's quite personal and not at all private.
0.714300	"What makes me most anxious and worried is not knowing the doctor personally enough so that you know whether or not they have your best interest in mind on that particular day.  I think like anyone off that doctors can have ""off"" days."
0.285700	I always worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. Its not the doctor herself that makes me worry, just the thought that one day she might tell me I have cancer or something.
0.500000	I generally do not get too worried or anxious about anything.  What is, is.  If a problem reveals itself, I will tackle it head on.  Worrying gets you nowhere.
0.666700	I feel the most anxious and or worried if the Doctor may give me different results that I was hoping for, for some unexpected reason, that's why I am always trying to imagine the worst case scenario.
0.285700	My blood pressure. I always worry that it's going to start spiking. It doesn't though, so I am mostly worrying about nothing.
0.476200	Doctor's offices and hospitals in general are never fun places to be, it's where people go when they are sick or hurt or dying.  Really not a whole lot of positive connotations there. Also, there's always an irrational fear the doctor is going to stick you with needles or tell you you have cancer or whatever.
0.666700	"I tend to be an anxious person in general and have a family history of high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This often manifests in ""white coat syndrome"" when my physician or a nurse takes my blood pressure. It is usually off the charts the very first test, and sometimes it stays that way throughout the examination. This issue is further compounded as my employer/insurer has a ""wellness program"" that ties the outcomes of routine examinations with insurance premiums for the year, so there is extra incentive to maintain healthy numbers (with blood pressure being one of those numbers). For that reason, I record weekly blood pressure measurements to bring with me to examinations; unfortunately, my normalized recordings are not the ones that make it ""into the record"" for the wellness visit numbers..."
0.690500	That they are judging me. I just get so anxious that most of the time I won't tell them certain things because I'm embarrassed.
0.666700	The unknown makes me nervous.  Not my doctor.  I know that he will figure something out, but its the process of getting to that solution and the waiting to get in, or wanting to know that he can fix whatever is wrong.
0.285700	The results of a test i might have to take would make me feel very anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.
0.285700	Sitting surrounded by sick people, in an environment where nosocomial infections abound. A doctor's office is where sick people come, and a percentage of them are contagious.  Limiting the amount of time in a doctor's office reduces exposure risk.
0.785700	I worry that something could be very wrong.  I could potentially be diagnosed with a terrible disease like cancer.  To me, it's just the fact that my day could have been going very well, and that could be changed with a few sentences.  I get concerned that something could have been wrong with me for a while, and that it might be too late to be reversed.
0.142900	I sometimes get nervous that I will get sick while I am there. If I am going to puke I would prefer to do it in the comfort of my own home.
0.666700	I get nervous that the doctor will scrutinize my health. I do not want to here things that I know, like drinking less pop or eating less carbs etc. I also get worried they may find some serious health complication that will upend my life.
0.452400	I most worry about how I am going to pay for the doctor bill AND the prescription they are likely to prescribe. It seems that everything requires a new medicine.
0.238100	I always get somewhat anxious when visiting the doctors because of all the germs and sick people there presently or before me. I always sit furtherest away from people as possible and hand sanitize to restrict the spread of illness as much as possible. As far as the actual visit, it's not that bad it's just the germs and illness I am weary of. 
0.333300	I would only be anxious or worried if there was a new problem that required tests and a wait for results to find out if there was something to be concerned about.
0.333300	It feels kind of impersonal and condescending to be sitting there feeling as though you are being talked down to most of the time, or like you have 15 minutes of this doctor's time and then he's moving on. Being on display makes me feel anxious.
0.857100	I am worried that they will find something bad. I am very anxious about my health and am always worried that something major is going to turn up no matter how unlikely that is. I also get worried about pain such as from shots. 
0.666700	I just tend to worry that there may be something wrong with me. My family has had a history of heart and cancer issues, and I always fear that one of those, or something else entirely will affect me at some point.
0.714300	If I have something wrong with me that has been bothering me for a while I am concerned about what the cause may be. I worry that the doctor may find something considerably wrong. I worry that the doctor may run a test that will have a very bad result.
0.857100	It mostly isn't  a conscious thing, I just get this feeling of dread from being in hospitals even if I am not the one being treated, I don't really know why. but weighing myself causes anxiety because i am really fat and I know that the doctor is going to bring it up (which is their job so I am not saying it is wrong). I also have anxiety about my health so I am always nervous that they are going to find something wrong with me. Also if I am being honest there is an inferiority complex going on, doctors are successful and even though I know it's just in my head there is a feeling like the doctor is looking at me like I am a looser.
0.619000	When visiting the doctor, I am always aware of the possibility that something I considered a minor issue may seem more serious to my doctor and lead to a diagnosis of an urgent health issue. 
0.619000	I typically won't go to a doctor's office unless I am completely sure something is wrong. By the time I am there, I know I have a problem and I tend to worry about how bad it is at that stage. I do not like people touching me as well, so being examined always pushes my personal space limits. 
0.738100	I get anxious sometimes believing the doctor is going to tell me something negative about my health. I also stress out about having some medical procedure that will cost me out of pocket money, for some outrageous medical bill I will receive. 
0.571400	just been to so many doctors feel more worn out and tired of all the appointments. there have been times i've been worried but i don't have the energy anymore for much worry. 
0.404800	I have high blood pressure and at anytime I expect that will effect me in a negative way, despite having it under control with meds, I do still get worried at exams or blood drain. Another is my age. I am over 50, so I know lots of thing a happen at this age range that I should be concerned about. Getting a colonoscopy is one thing I have not done yet, and I should.
0.642900	I do not feel that anxious or worried most of the time. But sometimes, I feel anxious which I think is very normal. I usually feel anxious or worried if the symptoms is something new. I am especially worried if I have my exams coming soon. I get worried about how long will I be sick, missing important class, not being able to do well in the class. Sometimes I get worried if the disease will last for a long time.
0.190500	The most nerve-wracking part of visiting the doctor's office is the potential that something serious is wrong; but, otherwise, I do not experience a strong anxiety about actually seeing the doctor. 
0.142900	I would feel anxious if i had blood work or sometime of test . Say a disease test , They werent able to provide me with results over the phone, Made me go to the office 
0.833300	A diagnosis that i was not expecting or finding out that ive put off treatment for so long and it's worse that I thought
0.666700	I worry about problems I have no control over. I have had problems with my blood pressure in the past and I worry that my blood pressure will be high again. I worry that some other problem that I am unaware of will be noticed. 
0.571400	I feel really anxious when I visit my doctor because I just want to get done with my doctor appointment as fast a possible. 
1.000000	Most likely it's basically because I have never liked being physically touched and also because I have a fear that they will find something seriously wrong. I also don't want someone telling me that I have to change my way of doing things and I absolutely don't like being lectured to.
0.714300	I guess it is just a normal anxious thing for most everyone. The waiting is probably the biggest thing that makes me anxious. 
0.166700	Nothing really. I am usually at ease. I guess if I had to choose one thing it would be waiting in that small room all by myself.
0.428600	I am sometimes worried that she will judge my life choices or tell me that I am seriously sick. I once had a doctor fat shame me. 
0.309500	I feel anxious being left in a cold room by myself for too long. It leaves me too much time to think and make myself worried
0.714300	There is always fear that the Doctor might bring news of terminal illness that might be afflicted with. So that fear of bad news is what make me anxious and worried.
0.214300	Not knowing how unpleasant the treatment/examination might be. Also I might receive bad news. That bad news might raise the possibility of pain, suffering and unpleasant treatments.
0.285700	Not too much makes me concerned when I am at the doctors office. i dont go very often but when I do it's usually not for a major issue, its just because its time to check up on my health so usually I am not worried. If there is something going on that brings me in that might make me a little anxious, especially if I have to get tests done because I dont get the results right away.
0.928600	I'm always wondering what is the doctor gonna find. I lost a parent to cancer at a young age so I always think I'm going to get a cancer diagnosis.
0.190500	I tend to google things a lot (big no-no) whenever I feel exceptionally bad, or have something weird going on physically, so that tends to create a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. I assume the worst. 
0.619000	I am over weight and I am always fearful that the Dr. writes he off because its my weight.. instead of looking further into y problem.
0.904800	I am most worried about what diagnosis they are going to give me and what I am going to do about it.
0.238100	I get most anxious when waiting for a blood tests or physical exams.  I don't worry about the doctor, I worry about what could be wrong with me.
0.142900	The length of time I have to wait for my scheduled appointment time. Billing seems to be an issue a lot. I get frustrated with the lack of respect of my time.
0.428600	That he might find something I didn't know what was wrong with me.Or that I might need a shot. those things scare that crap out of me.
0.166700	I think the doctor might not understand my condition. I also think that they may rush to quickly to conclusions or not fully recognize what is going on.
0.714300	You never know what to expect when you go into an appointment. Usually you are going because something doesnât feel right in your body and that worries you. With the internet nowadays you can always look up the worst case scenarios and no matter how hard you try the thought of the worst is always in your head. This scares a lot of people before they go to visit the doctor and that sometimes includes me
0.738100	Sometimes I have fear before entering the doctor's office in terms of finding a health complication that I didn't know I had before.  Usually, these examinations end well for me. 
0.142900	The only thing that makes me anxious about seeing a doctor is that they will recognize a problem that I did not know existed. But that is why you see a competent physician.
0.738100	I always feel like I am going to be told that my cholesterol is too high and that I need to start taking medication for it. I know this is just my doctor doing his job, but I don't like having medications pushed on me. I rather eat healthier and get more exercise.
0.357100	What makes me feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit is usually just my condition, hoping that it isn't something super serious or expensive to fix. Needles also make me uncomfortable, but they are a necessary evil at times.  
0.357100	I am anxious about possibly being seek, or needing a treatment. Usually I go visit during routine checkups, I am not very anxious about those. When I go when I do not feel too good, I worry about finding out if I will need a treatment. I also do not like needles, so if I have to get a shot, I feel anxious. 
0.381000	I am most anxious that I will forget to mention something- or what most people probably feel- that they will receive some bad news. In general I keep healthy habits and have not received any bad news. I am 39 so generally I do not expect to hear bad news about my health as I have not so far.
0.238100	I suppose the most anxious thing I have worried about is whether or not the doctor was in a rush. Sometimes they try and push you out and don't like being asked many questions.  
0.666700	What makes me most anxious and worried when I visit the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me and I will have some sort of health problem that I've been unaware of.
0.309500	I'd say just randomly having some new infection that I didn't suspect because I usually do things that wouldn't harm myself so this would surprise me and make me wonder which activity exposed me to this and what I can do to correct it. Also, I sometimes will worry about needles if I have to get one just because I'm not a huge fan at the end of the day
0.571400	The only thing that really gives me any problems is thinking about the unknown and the possiblity that there could be something wrong with me that i don't know about.  This presents a small level of anxiety and fear that there could be something that is not good. 
0.523800	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. On the contrary, I want to find an answer to why I feel so bad, or something that will help me. Unfortunately, my concerns go largely ignored.
0.619000	Just the act of going to see the doctor.  There's sick people everywhere, the office is usually cold, especially in the examination room..  You often have to wait alone in the exam room for a few minutes which increases anxiety..  Shots aren't too bad, but it's still a needle so those suck..
0.714300	I'm always worried that I have some serious medical condition.  I'm a hypochondriac, and I think what worries me most is being diagnosed with some horrible condition that I've never heard of.  Also, I have a bit of a fear of needles.  I'd hate to be surprised by having to take a blood test.
0.619000	I feel anxious and worried when I am at the doctors office because I always worry of getting some disease that cant be cured or cancer I am sick all the time with ibs and I recently had hyplori I have alot of stomach issues and bowel issues so I always think of the worst outcome possible I am very anxious
0.619000	I am worried about what will be found when they examine me, if it's something serious or not. I'm worried about the cost, and I'm worried about being judged for my weight. I'm usually very anxious about all of these things. 
0.333300	I really dont have any anxiousness at any of my doctors office visits usually. The only time there is anxiousness is if my doctor orders bloodwork to be done. While the procedure itself is easy, the before hand is what gets me anxious. 
0.381000	I get anxious because i'm always afraid that they are going to tell me that something  is wrong and need to change something. 
0.142900	The things that could make me most anxious is that i am always pressed for time. The majority of the time when i go to the doctor it is a all day experience because the doctors office is so busy. SO i worry that i wont get out of there  on time to finish my day. I could also worry that there could be something wrong with me that is not fixable.
0.738100	When I visit the doctor, I'm most worried about them finding something wrong with my overall health, or even something specific that could really harm me.  I worry I'll need some type of invasive procedure.
0.642900	If I'm having symptoms or there's been a change in my condition since my last visit, I worry that something's wrong with me. I worry that it could be serious and that it could be expensive. I don't have a lot of money for healthcare.
0.523800	I worry that he may uncover unknown ailments that could create new life challenges, or exacerbate the ones already experienced from being a type 1 diabetic.
0.261900	I am always worried about two things primarily. When I enter a doctor's office, and sometimes even before, I am slowed down by the thought of the total cost of the visit. I find it very taxing to my patience that I get charged for my visit to the center, and then I get charged for my doctor's time AND THEN I get charged for my prescription. This is all of course assuming you pay the school's insurance fee which is far higher than the govt marketplace plans available to the public. The second worry I have going in is that whatever I am scheduled to have checked out will be worse than I thought. I have an acute worry that if I go check myself up the doctor will tell me oodles of things that are wrong with me, which sounds scary honestly. I suppose the second reason also ties into extra bills.
0.571400	I get worried because I always think the worst and that the news will be bad because a lot of times it has been. Iâm 35 but I have already been diagnosed with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis and have had an ischemic stroke. After getting these diagnoses when I least expected them, I just feel like any diagnosis is possible for me.
0.285700	Nothing, I visit the doctor's office with they hope that they can resolve my issue, not worried that they'll make it worse.
0.642900	I do not like the doctors office because its always full of sick people. I do not want to make my health worse by compromising it. I also believe that doctors try to push pills on to people and get incentives for it.
0.666700	I'm afraid that they will give me bad news. I'm afraid of getting sick in the future so I feel nervous.  
0.309500	I get slightly anxious when talking about my pre-existing condition (sleep apnea). Another thing that might make me a little bit anxious is getting a physical (for obvious reasons).  Getting weighed also makes me slightly nervous.
0.476200	I am worried that they will find something wrong with me. I don't want to be told I have high blood pressure, or something wrong with my blood work. So it makes me nervous to go. 
0.595200	The alone time in the doctor's office is what makes me the most nervous. Usually when you show up you wait in that room for 30+ minutes alone. It is very cold in there, and usually the rooms are a plain white color. I become especially worried after a blood test/physical/etc when the doctor says they will return shortly and I am left alone again.
0.190500	I usually worry that they will not be able to hear the baby's heart beat.  After that I worry that they will come too soon or that I didn't take care of them well enough in utero.  It's hard to know that all is okay until they are here.
1.000000	Everything.  What if I catch something while I'm there?  What if the thing I'm going to the doctor about is 10 or 100 times worse than I thought?  It's horrible.  What if they find something I wasn't even expecting?  So much worry for something that could maybe be handled at home.
0.238100	I hate the blood pressure cuff. I always get really nervous when they put the cuff on me and I have to sit there while my blood pressure gets taken. Because I get so nervous, my reading is very high.
0.690500	I always have a fear in the back of my mind that I may receive life changing news. I have had surgery a couple of times in the past and so I tend to think of the worst case scenario. My worry tends to play tricks on my mind and make any form of pain seem worse than it may be.
0.547600	I am just uncomfortable being in a doctors office and having them exam you and touch you. When I think there is something wrong with me sometimes I am concerned they are going to think I am crazy, and there isn't anything wrong, or maybe there really will be something wrong. Just being in the doctors office gives you that feeling of what are they going to find.
0.309500	"I dislike having anything ""invasive"" like a papsmear, but that's probably me (and most people), and does not reflect on my doctor."
0.476200	I just worry that something will be wrong with me or go wrong in the process. Nothing has been wrong with me yet, but I did the most worrying when I was pregnant. I thought for sure something would go wrong with the baby, but everything ended up being okay. I'm just a worrier in general.
0.142900	i don't have these feelings at the DR's . I always feel comfortable there because we have a high level of mutual trust.
0.714300	My main worry is that the doctor will not be there.  In the past 12 months I have been to my appointment each month only to have the doctor on vacation 2 of those times and one time no one was there and the door was locked.  I don't worry about what he may tell me I only worry that I wont be able to get my Rx's filled.
0.785700	I tend to feel anxious when I visit the doctor because as much as I like my doctor, I do not like going to the doctor. I am always worried that I will get bad news or a bad diagnosis of health
0.428600	I do not like to have my blood drawn so that is what makes me feel the most anxious and I worry about how test will come out. 
0.809500	The Doctor finding something very wrong, either cancer or something caused by my diabetes. I don't want to leave my family at a young age 
0.857100	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when I go to the doctor is knowing that I will probably leave with some sort of mind altering medication. I have bipolar 1. That can not be treated with therapy alone. I hate my medications and the side effects of them. I almost died because of the medications that I was given about a year or so ago. I am now horrified to try anything new when it come to medication. Though it does stop certain moods, it turns me into a vegetable that can barley function. 
0.785700	I'm extremely private and modest. I don't like having to disrobe in front of him. It makes me feel completely awkward and uncomfortable - like I'm being judged.
0.595200	What makes me most anxious is that I feel insane. Doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. They keep telling me I'm fine and there's nothing wrong with me and making me waste time when I don't feel fine and need better medicine.
0.690500	Just the idea that something could be worse than it seems. Or that they'll berate me or something like that.
0.857100	Mostly, I am concerned that I will have a major health problem diagnosed or discovered. I am always thinking of the worst possible scenarios in the moments leading to my scheduled appointments, especially when it's not a regular checkup and I am going to the appointment because I am feeling ill or something similar. Those moments always make me anxious, and I usually feel relief when the appointment is over and nothing major is discovered.
0.690500	Ever since my mother died of a rare neurological disease, I worry that something terrible is going to happen to me, especially in regard to my health.  It is a ridiculous fear, and one that I am trying to get over.  I worry about what could happen 
0.738100	I worry about the tests.  I'm ashamed that I did not lose weight or do everything my doctor told me and that I'd disappoint them.
0.809500	Finding out that something is wrong with my health and that I will have a short while to live or that perhaps my lifestyle choices will have taken a significant toll on my body and state of health.
0.166700	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctor.  The only thing I could say may be a factor is just uncertainty about having a serious issue, but this is not typically how I think.
0.881000	Doctors have a strong and conservative mindset. They are not flexible. They can not look past the main concern and focus on something else. In my personal case, doctors can't look past my weight issues. Even though I have an entirely different medical concern that is not related to weight, they keep focusing on weight. I am also anxious because I do not like physical exams, I do not like to be completely honest because they judge you regardless.
0.881000	I dislike uncertainty, so I tend to feel a good deal of anxiety while waiting for test results and analysis. If I had 100% certainty that a particular ailment could be successfully treated with a particular approach or if pharmaceutical intervention would always work exactly as I wishes, my anxiety would likely abate. The not knowing makes it difficult for me and the waiting for results heightens the negative affect.
0.785700	The single thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the fear of being diagnosed with something that I had no idea I had. I am always scared that when Iâm doing a check up theyâll find something wrong with me, but I know it is better they find it sooner rather than later.
0.738100	I just don't like the entire experience even though I know that most doctors are there to help and they really care but I don't like tests and being probed and don't like the possibility of them finding something bad.
0.309500	When I am being given shots. Since I was a child I have had a phobia of needles and do not enjoy when I need one. I understand they are important, but I still don't like them.  
0.428600	I worry that something out of the ordinary will be discovered, and that I'll have some problem that I don't even know about.
0.142900	A primary concern for all of us would be the money and how much we will spend on the visit. Also thinking that there might be something terrible going on with me
0.928600	I have anxiety regularly, but I also hate being the sole focus in any situation. Plus, I don't like exposing myself due to a childhood trauma. I am sure that my distrust of my PCP adds to his anxiety. 
0.714300	I get anxious during the waiting time, I worry about the results of exams and tests I may have or need and discussions about things that may be wrong with me
0.142900	I have had unexplained pain a few times and I have been nervous wondering what it could be prior to going. I felt anxious to have tests done and get results in case it was bad news. I never felt scared to speak with my doctor though.
0.333300	"Well I'm usually pregnant and towards the end of the pregnancy they ""check"" you for dilation. I just hate that. And I hate pap smears too, which are similar in uncomfortable feeling."
0.714300	"It's that stupid adage of ""What you don't know, won't hurt you"". I know it is bad to think such, but it is scary knowing that something is wrong. I often don't go to doctors until i need to out of fear that they will find something."
0.381000	Uncertainty is what would bother me the most. The uncertainty of if something is wrong and what to do if there is something wrong. 
0.714300	I'm worried but also curious, if they will find something and worried they may make a wrong choice for me.
1.000000	I consider myself a hypochondriac so when I got to the doctor I sit there imagining all the things that could be wrong with me.
0.666700	Knowing that I was unable to ascertain the cause or treatment necessary to overcome whatever the ailment happens to be. Knowing that my literal life is in another person's hands. It is an opportunity for life or death, the gravity of it gets to me.
0.857100	For one thing having an appointment at a certain time and then having to wait and wait.  Then when you finally see the doctor he spends very little time with you.  I get anxious about the outcome of my visit and what he will find.  My blood tends to rise a bit in this instance.
0.238100	i feel most anxious about what could be wrong with me i also dont like no knowing and waiting for awhile im a generally anxious person so when it comes to public events i just am not in my overall comfort zone
0.714300	Basically I go when I have problems . So not knowing the issues makes it worse. I feel threatened because of how uncertain everything is.  
0.452400	I think going to the doctor, in general, gives me a little anxious feeling.  Whether you are going because of a problem or a regular examination, the feeling of wonder about what he/she will say about your health is definitely present.
0.452400	I dislike going to the doctors in general- I have anxiety and hate needles. I pass out when getting blood drawn, they are unsympathetic...the list could go on... 
0.547600	I just get worried that my glucose numbers are not good enough for my doctor. I'm also worried that they will find something new that's wrong with me.
0.642900	You never know what your results are going to show so that can be nerve wracking. But also being examined fully by someone you donât know very well is just uncomfortable 
0.142900	I only really feel anxious if my daughter is very sick. I want to make sure that she gets the best treatment possible. I have a hard time when she is sick because I worry about her. Sometimes I am worried that she won't get the right treatment plan. Usually my anxiety is relieved when I actually talk to the doctor.
0.238100	I'm worried the doctor will see something that I didnt know was a problem.  Or that something that is bothering me is more serious that it initially seems.  
0.547600	Fear of the unknown.  I am worried about what she might find when doing an evaluation.  I am worried that she might find something wrong.
0.642900	I feel anxious and worried when i visit any doctor . The reason is because i am always afraid of my health. I am afraid that doctor would say something wrong about my health
0.714300	Well I consider myself rather poor so I always worry about my doctor finding some kind of condition I have , that would be very costly to cure. So basically I am afraid of the money I will have to spend. 
0.404800	I would be most anxious about something being wrong with me in general. My family has many hereditary health and autoimmune problems and I have a few myself. Several members of my family have also had cancer while young and I have shown some signs of potentially developing two types of cancer in the past. I am moderately concerned and worried about the possibility of developing cancer while relatively young like several relatives. I am anxious in general about talking about myself and having myself touched by another person. I have general anxiety and just don't really like talking to people much, especially about myself.
0.357100	I'm often worried that my health may have deteriorated since my last visit. May blood pressure or weight may have gone up, or some other medical condition may have arisen.
0.642900	I don't really know what it is, I don't think it is the doctor themselves, but rather just the entire experience. I go to a hospital when I am not feeling well, so in my head, everyone is wondering what is wrong with me or why I am there. Plus, I do not want to have a time where I go to the doctor and something is very wrong with me. 
0.476200	I don't know if I will be there for an hour, waiting. If I have tests I would be anxious about the results. 
0.595200	I'm always afraid they won't take my concerns seriously, that they think I'm over-exaggerating my symptoms. I've had a doctor flat out tell me I was wrong even though I knew I was correct and it led to a fear that I just won't be listened to. 
0.428600	What makes me feel most anxious when I am at a doctor's office is when I have to take an eye exam, because I feel they never give me sufficient time to focus on what lens is better when I'm getting tested.
0.523800	I worry they are going to find a health condition. I'm always worried they will discover cancer. I also worry in general that my cholesterol will be too high, they will comment on my weight, and other routine health conditions. 
0.571400	It would be finding something terribly wrong with me, like cancer or an unknown illness. That's the worst kind of news a doctor can give someone.
0.333300	That they don't take me seriously. I have gone multiple times with the same symptoms and each time I am given the same prescription and physical therapy recommendation. This has gone on for 3 years.
0.547600	I'm not sure what makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, maybe it's the possibility of having to do more tests.
0.714300	I am always worried that the doctor may tell me that I have been diagnosed with a serious medical condition.
0.333300	My main concern and cause of anxiety is the worry that my actual illness is serious. I'm very rarely thinking about or distrusting the doctor or healthcare provider instead.
0.238100	Again, it is not necessarily feeling these things outright and instead, just wanted to be prepared and anticipatory. Being aware increases the chances for finding the best solution. 
0.357100	The thing that makes me the most anxious is going in to see the doctor for something minimal and finding out that it was a serious problem. I still remember the time I went to the doctor with my mother to get her checked up and during the time she thought it would be a good idea for me to get checked out too. When we went there the nurse said that everything was fine with my mother so I felt relieved but when she went to my results she had said I had a few traces of kidney stones in me. I began to worry because I always saw myself as very healthy but she reassured me it wasn't that big of a deal.
0.785700	That they will tell me some stuff, and it will seem to make sense, but ultimately it won't help me with any of my problems and nothing will be resolved.
0.714300	I think that most people walking into a doctor's office, even if they look and feel healthy, are anxious and worried about being diagnosed with something terrible. Just a few years ago I thought that I was quite healthy and was told at the age of 30 or 31 that I had very high cholesterol and had to start taking prescription medication to address the problem.  Every time I go to the doctor I'm worried that I might learn of a similar problem.
0.142900	The battle I sometimes have to have to get them to use a manual blood pressure cuff on me instead of an automatic one.   As previously mentioned, I have severe osteoporosis due to osteogenesis imperfecta.   It is possible for the automatic one to tighten so much that it can literally fracture my arm.  Thus as the nurses' handbook for OI states, a manual blood pressure cuff should be used on folks like me.    Doctor's office staff are not used to patients coming in and insisting on the use of a manual cuff.   I don't look forward to having to go through that each time.
0.452400	If you're feeling under the weather and the cause is not immediately apparent, resulting in tests - and you need to wait on test results before treatment can be decided.
0.523800	The unknown, not knowing if what health check up could turn up or progress into something worse or more intense. Anxiety hits everyone, and just going to one would incur a little bit of worry or doubt when getting checked out and evaluated.
0.238100	Going to the doctor is like taking your car to the mechanic. There could always be something seriously wrong that will require time and money to fix. In this case, my health is the most important, so of course I am concerned the doctor would find something bad under my hood.
0.214300	I typically am not very anxious when I go to the doctor. The only time that I do worry is when I'm not sure what's going on with me. As I typically don't get sick, this is not really an issue for me. 
0.595200	I worry that there will be something wrong with me, something that will cost a lot of money to fix and I would not be able to cover the medication or procedure. I do not going to hospitals in general so that does not help my situation at all.
0.619000	I'm always afraid that I will get bad news and it worries we every time I go to the Dr's office. I have a great doctor and he always lets me know what I need to do.
0.142900	I feel anxious and worried when I have to go and something is wrong that I can't figure out pretty much by myself because my mother died from multiple myeloma. It was not found until she was stage 4. So I am always anxious whe I have to wait for lab results.
0.619000	Never know if when going for a checkup for one thing, some other thing could be discovered. I guess the anxious feeling is that i do not fully understand everything that could be happening in my body until a checkup
0.428600	I am anxious about my health first. Secondly, I am afraid I will get huge medical bill I cannot afford.
0.761900	I think it's just the idea that, while I may be there for one thing, they may find something else wrong with me. The idea that all the care I take to be healthy and to make sure I am well might mean nothing because my body might betray me in a way I have little control over. 
1.000000	I have white coat syndrome. Going to the doctor's no matter what it is for makes me anxious or worried. I feel my blood pressure raising. There could be nothing wrong, but a cold and I still get all worked up.
0.642900	Learning the results of tests that I've had taken. I usually get scheduled for tests like cat scans to check my lungs. Waiting til my next appointment to learn the results of those tests makes me anxious to the point of almost being sick to my stomach.
0.595200	It makes me anxious that they may find something severely wrong with me and it will change my life. Or that they will misdiagnosed something and it will affect my well being. 
0.666700	i sometimes become worried because i tend to imagine the kind of disease they will find that i am suffering from,i fear the kind of injections and medications i will go through and at the same time i fear loosing my life because of illness
0.523800	I think the scariest thing is not knowing what the result of your test are going to be. Even if you feel super healthy and you are living a healthy lifestyle nobody can be 100% sure that they are healthy 
0.476200	I think that all people who go to a medical practice feel the same as me. Perhaps the patient goes with a slight abdominal discomfort and in the consultation discovers that it was not something so light what he felt but it was or is a serious and delicate disease. However, I recommend taking this risk and going to the doctor. That will always be the best option.
0.571400	I never know if itâs going to go okay. I have a heart condition and sometimes things look great and other times not so great. Itâs stressful and expensive. 
0.642900	I don't want the doctor to randomly tell me I've been doing something wrong, or that I have 2 months to live, or some type of cancer. All of those ideas freak me out. I don't want there to be something wrong with me. 
0.690500	In general, I would feel anxious because I would not be sure what the diagnosis would be.  Also, I'm always worried about having to buy medicine or take time off of work.  So I always feel apprehensive until I find out what the problem and treatment is.
0.285700	I have social anxiety so that always plays into my anxiousness. I also will sometimes worry that I will get diagnosed with something bad or that there will be a major problem when I go. Though it's usually in the back of my mind. 
0.785700	I had cancer 8 years ago, so I naturally worry that something might develop, or perhaps secondary cancers from my treatment.  I also am embarrassed about my weight, although I am on a walking program and am doing the best I can.
0.690500	I usually feel anxious and worried when I am unsure of the outcome of a diagnosis. When I am going to see a doctor for a concern with my health and I don't yet know the diagnosis, that makes me very uneasy. The other thing that makes me worried about visiting doctors, is the doctor themselves at times. Because I don't know the doctor personally and I am unsure of what type of person they are and how they maybe professional or not. 
0.428600	I guess when I go to the doctor I am scared that they will find something really bad, as I have had cervical cancer and it came back 3 times.  I try not to be negative but it just worries me.
0.738100	I am always worried that I have some form of cancer. I smoked for many years and did not take care of myself becuase I was taking care of others. Now I am suffering for it. I want to live a long life, but I fear cancer
0.714300	I think the fear that something might be wrong with me is the worst. The scary thing is that even if you think it's something small it might turn into something huge. I can see why people try to avoid it.
0.381000	always worry about going to the doctor. some tests can show somthing is wrong even when you have no symptoms so that always gives me a little anxiety until i know what is going on fully
0.333300	Finding out from the doctor that I have medical condition is what makes me most anxious or worried.  The medical condition may require taking medicine or seeing a specialist.  I always feel relieved when I go to the doctor for a physical and it turns out that nothing is wrong with me.
0.571400	My most anxious moments at the Dr's office involve tests which have been recommended and the realization that I will not be able to pay the co-pay and deductible required for most of the needed tests.
0.714300	I just never really know what to expect and I feel that it is a waste of time. There has been wrong diagnoses in the past with people, so who knows. It's like flipping a coin. I'd be more worried about what the doctors says if anything.
0.523800	I feel anxious about telling things to the doctor because I always feel like the doctors don't believe me or think my concerns are not important. I also feel anxious if I have to be undressed for an exam.
0.500000	"I am most concerned of a ""worst case scenario"" that I have built up in my head when a medical condition has become severe."
0.142900	Nothing does as I do not go to the doctors at all. If i were to go to the doctors it would be something very serious that I need to get checked out with tests, so I would be worried about whatever I was getting tested for. 
0.523800	The main thing that makes me anxious when going to the doctor is wondering if they will find something very wrong with me. I worry about ever contracting a deadly disease where it is unlikely to be cured. This reason alone is why I make sure I see my doctor for my annual checkups. I want to know well in advance if I need to get something treated. 
0.690500	I am worried sometimes when I visit that my weight will be more than the previous visit.  I am worried to he get onto me possibly about the weight.  I am worried that the blood work could show some issues like high cholesterol.  I am worried that the blood test could show high liver levels which could be fatty liver. I am worried my blood pressure could be elevated.  The blood pressure maybe just elevated during that time because I am nervous about our visit.  Usually tho I feel very comfortable with my Dr.  
0.904800	When I see one of my specialists I am afraid she will find that something is wrong and that I will require surgery.  I have already had four of them for a medical condition I have.  She is a great, caring doctor but the fear of the unknown is the worst part.  I have an anxiety disorder as well so that makes the experience even worse.
0.452400	I worry that he will find something wrong with me that I am not aware of.  I get a little anxious when he runs tests and I am not sure why he feels they are needed.  I don't like the explanation that he runs them for all patients in my age group.  I understand that he is pro-active, but sometimes it worries me.
0.785700	I am worried about making sure to resolve whatever issue I have come in for. I am worried about my insurance working properly. I am anxious about what questions the doctor will ask.
0.666700	I feel most anxious about some bad news I could get from the doctor's. I am overweight, so I am always worried that I could have a diagnosis related to that.
0.142900	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is my skin appearing to be in need of hydration. I never want to appear to my doctor as being as ashy.
0.809500	"I am always concerned for surprises. I'm always afraid that they will find something ""new"" that is wrong with me, which is disheartening, considering how many chronic conditions I have."
0.166700	I just don't like going to the doctors office. I am a very healthy person, but the process of being in the doctors office does generate a very small amount of anxiety. Mostly the long waits. After I meet with the doctor, all is good.
0.642900	Mostly my fears are actually going to the hospital and getting sick. I also don't do well with waiting in long lines. I need to be able to get in and out. I also hate not having my records available online. 
0.761900	I always worry that the doctor will find something significantly wrong with me. For example, I am a cancer patient, and constantly worry that he will find my cancer has spread. No matter how simple the problem, I become very anxious prior to my appointment.
0.214300	What makes me feel worried is just the anticipation about whatever could be ailing me being worse than I thought it was. I would not want anything serious to happen to me in that case.
0.238100	I don't really get nervous that much. It's more about shots. I hate getting shots and i'm terrified of needles. That's really the only reason. Getting my flu shot was hell LOL.
0.666700	I am anxious that I will have a visit like my last one and that all he will see is my weight and not me. 
0.142900	I dont like getting blood tests. That is truly my only fear. Overall, i would say that I have no fear of the doctor. I am in generally decent health overall, so i dont have much to fear. 
0.357100	I feel anxious because I want to be better but most times I have something new that arises and adds to my disease debt. I try to remain optimistic but until they give you a positive result it is hard to do that so most times I am waiting on them to say something negative. I also just don't like waiting long lengths of time for the doctor to arrive. More times than not the doctor visit will require a needle for blood work so that makes me anxious as well. I am presented with multiple people before seeing the doctor which makes me feel like I have a huge problem that many people have to deal with. I just don't like having bad news.
0.285700	I don't usually feel anxious or nervous when visiting a doctor.  I feel that whatever feedback I get, I can learn from it.
0.381000	To put it simply... fear of the unknown.  Everyone goes through this, unless they're a psychopath (I actually kind of envy them for that).  If you don't know what's wrong, and you don't know how serious it is, you're going to have that fear.  I's normal.  I'm actually wondering why this question is even necessary.  
0.642900	I would hate to learn that I have a dreaded disease that I didn't know about. I would like to think that my lifestyle would keep me from having a bad disease.
0.214300	I feel dirty when I go into a doctors waiting room. And especially in the back room where you see the doctor. I think of all the sick people that are in the same area and it makes me feel very dirty. Like I need to take a shower as soon as possible or something.
0.261900	I worry that I come across as complaining about every little thing. I have a terrible habit of ignoring things for a long time until they become a big problem, and then going to the doctor. I decided I didn't want to do that, but now I feel as if I have been put through a ton of unnecessary testing this year because of my complaints to the doctors, and I worry that I am presenting myself as a hypochondriac
0.738100	My mind always goes to the worst case scenario when I don't feel well or my kids don't feel well. I am always worried that my own diagnosis will be confirmed or that the course of treatment for whatever is wrong will be expensive or time consuming. I really fear being sick or injured and really worry that I something terrible will happen and I will get diagnosis that something is wrong.
0.547600	When I have an acute problem that hasn't gone away on its own, I can feel pretty anxious. I can also feel anxious when I've been waiting for a long time.
0.309500	"My body and my car share some interesting commonalities. When I take my car to a mechanic, I dread hearing, ""Well, it could be the alternator or it might be the wiring or maybe the starter.""  The same is true of a doctor's visit. The worst possible result is lack of clarity.  That being said, of course there are situations where lack of clarity is real, and as long as doctors have a plan for clarifying a situation, I'm OK. Not thrilled, but OK. The main way that doctors reduce my anxiety and worry is by convincing me that they are telling me what they know or believe in complete honesty. If I don't think a doctor is leveling with me, then I get really anxious. I would rather have a truthful, irascible doctor than a pleasant, uninformative one."
0.285700	There have been times when a test or exam turned up something questionable that needed to be explored with further tests. I have had a few cancer scares. Those times were anxious for me, because I knew there was a possibility I would have cancer. Thankfully, I never did.
0.142900	"While I have never really experiences the sensation of anxiety or worry when visiting a doctor or health care provider, I can definitely imagine why many people are apprehensive.  Many people are worried that the treatment may hurt or feel uncomfortable during the exam.  People may also be scared to hear the truth regarding their condition and be in a state of ""ignorance is bliss"".  These factors cause people to not only worry and become anxious, but to also not follow up or seek treatment for their condition or ailments."
0.285700	That I will need to have shots or I will hear the word cancer. I do not mind the exam and any drugs or other things I would need to do.
0.666700	I have very strong white coat anxiety. I'm not worried about the aspect of pain particularly. It's more the whole aspect of fearing for the worst coupled with the unknown drives it. Loss of control and claustrophobic feelings also factor into it some extent. The apprehension is worse with some medical professionals than it is with others. 
0.404800	I worry that they may try to push a drug on me that will end up hurting me or ruining my life. Of course, I'm very resistant to that and I would reject anything that I couldn't research before I took it. I just feel like I have to keep my guard up and make sure that I'm doing what's right for me in my understanding of things, regardless of what the doctor wants. 
0.571400	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I am relatively young and in good health, but I am always concerned that something will come up that I am not expecting. I am too anxious of a person over all, so this is really in line with my personality.
0.761900	that i will be belittled, and my concerns wont be addressed because they will make up their mind about it with little information and dont do a full exam.
0.904800	I do not know what my current symptoms are, and how they effect the rest of my illnesses.  I dread going on new medicine.  I already take 9 presecriptions
0.285700	There is nothing in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried. I was anxious when finding out the sex of my baby.
0.809500	Worried that they'll find something seriously wrong - or worse, they'll miss something seriously wrong. Worried that they'll suggest I change my lifestyle in ways that make me unhappy.
0.666700	Thinking if they are really up to the task and willing to devote their full attention. If not, I may end up suffering from their incompetence and the lack of work ethic.  
0.809500	I feel that sometimes when I go to the doctor, I might not get what I am looking for right away. I also fear if I can afford it or if I am diagnose with something that can hurt my health and my future. 
0.619000	I was always somewhat anxious about all of my prenatal visits. I had struggled with infertility and had experienced a miscarriage prior, so everything related to the pregnancy made me nervous. It wasn't specific to the doctor. 
0.309500	I just get anxiety and my chest tightens up.  I am not sure why.  I have high blood pressure and it is always worse when I visit the doctor.  
0.714300	I don't trust them.  I always feel like I'm taking a chance when I go to see them.  I always question whether anything that they want to do is appropriate.  I always assume that anything negative I've been told in a doctor's office is just a starting point, that verification of anything I've been told will require a lot of research on my part and possibly even a trip to another doctor (who will probably contradict the first doctor).  
0.142900	Going to the doctor's office can be a real source of anxiety. ... examination, then all that time sitting there is probably making you dwell on your worries 
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. The only scenario I can imagine this might happen to someone is they go to a new doctor and don't know what to expect or happen.
0.261900	The only thing that I would feel anxious about is whether the doctor is going to find something wrong with my health.I have minor kidney disease, which worries me slightly, and my mother has diabetes- so I'm uneasy about my a1c readings
0.833300	I am most anxious about the cause of the problems I'm having as well as whether or not I'm wasting money with a particular doctor who won't address the problems until other costly procedures have been completed. 
0.404800	I worry that a doctor will not fully understand my pain or symptoms. I feel anxious about being overprescribed medication or receiving unnecessary medical treatments that I'll have to pay for.
0.642900	Finding out about something that may be a short term or long term sickness.  Having to change my lifestyle for a long term or permanent time.
0.428600	I have a family history of diabetes and heart disease. As much as I take care of myself, I am worried that I would get a diagnosis that is not in my favor.
0.690500	If I'm sick, I'm not sure what the diagnosis is, that makes me very anxious for obvious reasons. I'm most nervous when getting tested for STDs/HIV because I'm part of an at risk population, but I do my best to minimize that risk. I don't really get uneasy or uncomfortable talking personal bodily or hygienic stuff because to me that's expected in a medical setting.
0.381000	The possibility of receiving bad news is one thing, but honestly it doesn't make me too worried.  If I receive news about a condition, I am then empowered to do something about it.  The only other thing I can think of that makes me anxious is thinking about the bill I'm going to receive later.
0.833300	Mainly that being sick sucks and there are any number of things that could go wrong. It's no fault of the doctor's and is inherent to my own temperament. 
0.928600	I generally am uncomfortable around doctors and downright panicky around dentists.  I think this is all due to bad experiences as a child that I just cannot seem to get over.
0.142900	I am worried whether my weight, blood pressure, white blood cell will change for the worse. When I go for a screening whether it will show something I do not want to know I can fight.
0.595200	I really know what the doctor or nurse is going to say to me. If I gain a few pounds I feel like they are saying 'lose the weight fatty'. Also when it came to my mental problems they want to push drugs than get to a solutions so I worried they are just going to turn me into a zombie on drugs.
0.238100	I think he will give me some bad news about my bloodwork or that I've gained too much weight.  Ultimately though it always goes better than expected.
0.619000	There is always a chance that something bad can come up. Being in the office knowing that you may find out awful information is stressful. Likewise, if you haven't been listening to the doctors recommendation, you bound to get yelled at  for that.
0.404800	Last years diagnoses of cancer and then surgery and then a good diagnoses that they had caught it early.  That does make my appointments more stressful than before.  I think even before that that you wonder or worry more about your health as you get older.
0.142900	I have felt anxious or worried only once when seeing my doctor, and that weas when I had a naccident which fractured my hip.  I had never before experienced a broken bone and was fearful about how painful or long the treatment for recovery would be.
0.619000	When I don't know what is wrong with me and the doctor can't seem to find out either. It make me anxious and uncomfortable, but I try to remain calm so I can get accurate tests done.
0.381000	The unknowns make me feel the most anxious and worried. If for example I am having a very bad pain and I have no idea what it could be I feel very anxious waiting to find out because I always feel like it will be something bad. 
0.833300	Whenever I get a physical exam of course I get anxious because anyone can have hidden problems within their body and you never know what may be found at each exam. So as much as I want to stay ahead of the game I dread it every time.
0.190500	I think that will find something else wrong with me. I know that they want to make as much money as possible off of me, and so they will do everything they can to find something else.
0.714300	Doesn't everyone hate to go to the doctor? I know that being weighed is necessary for medicine doses and determining overall health, but I'd go a lot more if they didn't weigh me every time. If I'm a couple pounds over my last visit weight, I'll do everything I can to lose it before going to the doctor, or just not go. I suspect this is very common.
0.476200	I worry that I might have a serious illness.  I don't have much money, so I can't really afford to be sick.
0.571400	Iâm most anxious that lab results will have indicate I need some kind of medication.  I worry about my blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzymes but so far they are OK. 
0.738100	The amount of pain expected from some medical procedures is a cause of worry. Also, being told that there could be an abnormality in some test results. The cost of the visit or tests needed is also bothersome.
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried.  I have not had any serious health issues to date.  I sometimes get a little anxious waiting for blood test results.
0.357100	"I feel like there is a chance that something could be wrong with me and I need to brace myself for some sort of bad news. This can make me feel a little bit anxious when I see a new doctor. Sometimes I also worry that the doctor won't take me seriously because I look ""rough"". I have been pegged as ""drug seeking"" simply because of how I look. This has happened even though I am not even wanting any type of medication and I am a drug and alcohol counselor per profession."
0.881000	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I worry that she will criticize me for not having lost weight or exercising enough.
0.595200	That I will not be believed when I say I am in pain outside of the normal, that they will decide things about my health based on my appearance rather than my symptoms or not do the right testing because they think they know what my problem is without checking
0.381000	I worry sometimes that I will explain something badly pertaining to my medical condition or forget something important even if I write it down or even say too much thereby causing my doctor to send me in for tests or more prescriptions.
0.714300	Most of the time I feel dread and anxious because I'm scared of what they will find out and the cost of the visits and treatments. I'm also scared of their opinions of me in regards to taking care of myself the proper way.
0.452400	My biggest fear is that he would find something really wrong and need me to come back for further treatment. I guess that's a good thing in general, as I would be identifying a health problem... so I guess the anxiety would come from the possibility of having that problem at all.
0.142900	Anticipation of receiving possible negative news.  No one wants to hear anything negative at the doctor's office.
0.381000	I don't ever feel overly anxious. I usually go when I need to have an ailment treated with medication. Diagnosis is normally simple and routine. 
0.714300	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is the same thing I just stated in the prior narrative, is that I am concerned that physicians are primarily in the drug business and always looking to push drugs. I know that pharmaceutical companies incentivize physicians to prescribe drugs for pretty much everything and so I always fear that there is a âwitch huntâ in progress as a physician to look for reasons to prescribe and considers which drugs to use.
0.571400	I am worried first and foremost about the cost of procedures.  Next, I'm afraid of being misgendered and then misracialized.
0.190500	Mentally I am relaxed, but even benign medical procedures like taking my blood pressure can produce stress responses in me.  It's also difficult when they take blood, my veins are uncooperative and so it's typically a difficult process
0.142900	"It makes me nervous to think about expressing some kind of embarrassing or personal symptoms that might not seem ""normal"". "
0.785700	I think what make me anxious is just the whole environment of being at the doctor's office. It is not a comfortable feeling at all. It makes me feel very anxious. Further it makes me worried because I always feel like they are going to say things that are terrible. Or that the doctor is going to do tests I do not want nor like. In all the atmosphere of the doctor's office makes me anxious at best. It is not a good feeling. It just evokes bad feelings and the want to not even go. The anticipation sitting in the examination room waiting for the doctor not only creates anxiety but also worry. I have never been to the doctor's office and can say I felt at ease and calm. The whole experience of going to the doctor is just not conducive of good feelings. 
0.142900	I don't usually feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. The only thing that might worry me would be the discovery of a negative health condition or disease.
0.404800	Social anxiety is one of those things that you have to keep facing, over and over, no matter how scary it is. If you let it take over, it'll get too hard to even leave your house. I was terrified to get help, too. It took weeks before I finally gathered up the courage to make the call. I arrived for my appointment early so I could have time to sit in the car and compose myself before I went in. Once I was in the doctor's office, I shook so much that I could barely grip a pen. My voice came out in rapid little bursts, and I was drenched in sweat.
0.238100	I really don't like being touched by strangers. Even though I have been to my primary care doctor it still feels like being touched by a stranger.
0.285700	When I go to see my doctor I have a certain mindset. I do not let my emotions interfere with my mind, because as we know it can be deter mental to your health. So when I go to see my physician I usually listen to some calm music, trying to calm my nerves if anything, because as any human being we all have emotions, but we can control them, that's matter of practice. So in nutshell when I see my doctor I do not feel anxious or worried about anything and give myself the best chance possible to win. My mind is always on point, I am awake and aware.
0.142900	I typically am not worried when I go to see the doctor as I am ready to face any medical condition I might have. I don't particularly look forward to prostate exams during my annual physical I guess.
0.452400	That a symptom is more than I thought it was. That they're going to judge me for something and give me worse care. That they'll do something that my insurance doesn't cover and I won't realize it until I get a huge bill.
0.190500	I sometimes feel like the diagnosis does not match my symptoms. But I know it is all in my head. It is a character flaw nothing to do with my doctor. 
0.714300	I get very nervous about hearing bad news. That I am dying, or that my blood pressure is too high. I have always been afraid of doctors.
0.428600	I am always worried about bad news or if something is seriously wrong with me. It's always anxious when you find out something is wrong with you or if you need to change something in your diet.
0.142900	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something fatally wrong with me. Though I do not believe it is very likely any time soon, I worry about such a diagnosis happening one day. As someone who has a history with cigarettes and medications, I would not be surprised if I experienced a bad prognosis at some point in time. 
0.285700	The only time I fell anxious or worried when going to the doctor is when I think that I might have something wrong with me.
0.833300	I am always worried that a doctor is not going to hear what I am telling them or ignore my symptoms and play them down.  Then I get a huge bill a few weeks later.  I often felt like I was scammed or taken advantage of. This has happened so many times in the past.  
0.428600	I am getting older and just never know what my body is doing.i feel like my so called body clock is getting closer to its expiration date so to speak.i want to live a long life.
0.142900	I'm not anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's for an exam. I don't really like waiting and I dread the expense, but nothing about the appointment itself gets my very worried
0.619000	I worry that something is going to be wrong with me that I can not fix.  I don't like waiting in the waiting room or in the exam room.  I usually can't wait to get out of there.  
0.428600	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor, I feel like I am wasting my time. I'm not worried either.
0.261900	Its the anticipation. I know I could feel find but they chance that they find something or my blood work shows elevated LFTS or other medical issues such as anemia sometimes worries me.
0.238100	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just not knowing.  Not knowing on a few visits if I was going to have to do a basic test as the hospital and all the trouble that entails.  That's all. 
0.333300	depends on why I'm there, last time was for my back sciatica and I was expecting a worse case thing because the pain was severe, but it turned out not to be a major issue and in a few months I was good again
0.142900	If I am waiting test results that can be a little nerve wracking.  I do not like to wait for results to tests or blood work. 
0.738100	I am always nervous about what they are going to say about my health or my conditions.  I generally never really get anything to positive, so I always try to prepare myself for what is to come.  If I get a good report, then I'd rather be pleasantly surprised, then be hopeful and become disappointed.  
0.428600	I am always worried that something far worse than I have will occur. I tend to think overly regarding what could possibly be wrong. It is usually something pretty common however.
0.404800	Because I have a physician's assistant who is in our family I can usually get a good take on what is wrong with me. However, when something major happens such as the prostate cancer I went through and still must be checked on a periodic basis ... I admit I feel a little anxious and worried before the visit is over. Once I get the all clear signal I am back to normal. I usually do not sweat over it until the day of the visit.
0.571400	Just the not knowing if anything unexpected may show up in some kind of test or blood work.  You just never know when some type of medical problem that is unexpected happens.
0.547600	I am not sure. I guess it would be if it is just a check up or for a specific reason. If it is for a specific reason then I am always worried about what they may find or tell me.
0.523800	I don't feel a lot of these emotions. I usually am a pretty calm, cool, and collected person that tends not to make mountains out of mole hills. Due to the good fortune of never having a whole lot of serious health problems, my anxiety around doctors is pretty low, i'm not scared of needles, i believe in science and most of western medicine. I do experience some anxiety when waiting for test results, especially for serious things HIV, Hepatitis, Ect. I feel annoyance sometimes at having to wait so long in the waiting rooms, and do get a bit nervous about actually contracting diseases or sicknesses from waiting rooms and hospital lobbies. 
0.142900	I don't feel worried about the doctor because I feel the worst is over now ill get some medicine to feel better
0.476200	Its just embarassing. I am a modest person, so having ANYONE see me naked or half dressed is stressful
0.428600	SOMETIMES I WORRY THAT I'VE WAITED TOO LONG TO GO SEE THE DOCTOR ABOUT AN ISSUE AND THUS I CREATED AN INSTANCE WHERE MY TREATMENT WILL LAST LONGER THAN IT NEEDED TO OR THAT MY TREATMENT WILL COST MORE THAN IT WOULD HAVE HAD I GONE TO THE DOCTOR EARLIER.
0.571400	I don't like anything to change my schedule.  When I go to the doctor I feel anxious and worried.  But, the doc is friendly enough I relax.  I just want to get everything done.
0.642900	I am always anxious or worried about receiving bad news. I never want to end up leaving their offices knowing that I could have done something differently, but now that I did not, I will suffer in some way.
0.285700	Nothing, really.  There's the 1% chance that I might get blindsided by bad news, but that is very unlikely.  The only somewhat realistic concern I might have is if I was diagnosed with a condition that runs in my family, especially ones I'm actively trying to avoid.
0.857100	I have panic attacks,which I control with medication.  But, when I go to the doctor, I get very scared about them taking my blood pressure.  One time it was very high and they were concerned, but it was because I was having a panic attack in the office.  Now I always worry that my blood pressure will be high, and consquently my blood pressure is high!
0.142900	I usually don't feel nervous or worried when I go to the doctor's office.  The things that make me a little nervous are waiting in the waiting room and wondering which medications I might need if I'm sick.
0.500000	I meant to put anxious and nervous sometimes around doctors because it depends on why I am going to the doctors for. If it is something serious then I would feel nervous and anxious. 
0.833300	 Going to the doctors always has a component of dread for me. I fear my test results in particular after a period when I have let myself go physically or not watched my diet carefully. My particular fears are; cancer and signs of cognitive decline. My cholesterol is another concern as it is nearly always just outside the parameters and I am nearly always chided for that. I am diabetic but my A1c results have been consistently good for many years now. I dread going to the psychiatrist for anxiety meds because I really feat mental aging and there is nearly always a test for that involved with the visit.
0.190500	The feeling that something could be wrong that I dont know about that the doctor realizes is what makes me most anxious when visting the doctors office.
0.333300	I feel anxious mainly because I have general anxiety with my life. But it is the idea of not yet knowing what is wrong with me. And I generally think about the worst case scenario.
0.142900	For some reason I get anxious. But once I am in there I don't feel scared at all because my doctor makes me feel  better. Perhaps it's just the environment and anticipation that makes me scared.
0.785700	The uncertainty over the possibilities of what health issues could arise or be identified, not knowing what outcomes are possible and may occur.
0.500000	The uncertainty of not knowing whatâs making me feel ill, of having something very hurtful or that may result in a painful procedure or that might cost a lot of money.
0.714300	Well I am an anxious person to begin with so just having to go to the doctor is already enough to make me anxious. Plus it makes me feel vulnerable and uncomfortable sitting there being examined, often times in that flimsy robe thing. On top of that there is the overall worry of what might be wrong with you.
0.857100	I'm most worried about what the process is going to be and how awkward it'll feel. I'm more comfortable with a woman being my doctor and I have a male doctor, so I'm slightly uncomfortable.I'm also worried about if something is going to be found wrong.
0.523800	I'm generally calm in the doctor's office, but if I'm going in with something unknown, where I'm not certain what it is, there is a general anxiousness about the severity or seriousness of what I may be told. That I'm thinking it's something minor but it's something major. I have a bit more anxiousness than others, since I've had the experience where I received unexpected news that I had a serious disease before.
0.571400	I feel anxious or worried sometimes when  visiting the doctor because I am unsure if my illness may be something worse. I also get worried that I will receive bad news about my health at some point during the visit. I never fully calm down until I have left the office with a good bill of health.
0.547600	Not knowing what to expect when meeting with a new doctor. This applies to meeting new people in general, especially those with some authority (ex.: new boss).  Meeting new people always makes me a bit nervous.
0.595200	When I go to the doctor since I have hypothyroidism, I usually have to get lab work.  I have small veins so it can be difficult to draw labs sometimes.  I usually get anxious more about this than anything else.  There isn't usually anything the doctor did, but just don't always enjoy the tests they put you through.
0.428600	The fact that they're staring at me, listening to every word, makes me feel pressured and anxious.  I am afraid that I might accidentally forget something I need to tell them regarding symptoms or such.  I get particularly worried when I tell them my symptoms and they look at me like I'm a crazy person over-reacting.
0.928600	I feel most worried about my doctor judging me due to my health or possible mental problems I am experiencing. I do not feel I am able to be completely honest. 
0.452400	I feel anxious because I do not care being around doctors or nurses.  I feel as thought I am a healthy person and do not need to be in a doctors office for checkups.  I simply don't care to go to the doctor for any reason.
0.690500	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is finding out if there is something serious going on with my body, as well as not always knowing my exact medical health and finding out something terrible.
0.142900	Like many other patients, I am more anxious when running my regular checkups and expecting the results from the lab. I would also be quite nervous if there would be a complication and he would need to send me to the hospital.
0.285700	I think the worst is when you go into the doctor's office and you feel bad and you are not sure what the doctor is going to say.
0.500000	Generally speaking, I am fine going to the doctor's office unless I am waiting on test results for something or expected to have blood drawn, which I hate. I was the most anxious/worried when I was pregnant, as I had a number of manageable issues arise. Each time I went for another appointment, I feared the news of something else.
0.738100	I get just anxious about seeing and being around people. I don't know what it is. Afraid of things that could happen but I know they won't. 
0.619000	mainly just being at the office knowing that i may have to get blood drawn or something, or if i have to get a pap test that makes me very anxious b/c it is painful
0.285700	I am usually pretty good when going to the doctor.   I do get anxious waiting for them to come into the room but that is more due to me hating sitting there cold in the gown waiting and nothing to do with the actual appointment
0.523800	I feel anxious that maybe i have not taken care of myself as much as i should and that it may have lead to some form of problem that i do not notice that needs to take care of. I have had conditions in the past that i worry may come back
0.642900	I always worry that they will diagnose with something different illness or if they will prescribe some different medicine which at the end might have some sided effects.   
0.142900	Usually it's just stepping on the scale and seeing that it has crept on up again.  That and wondering if my blood pressure will be up or down.  I have no problems with any physical exam she may give, but of course may be anxious to find out what is causing the symptoms - whether it's serious for my health or just a minor problem.
0.500000	In general I always get tense visits to the doctors because I always think the worst of my diagnoses and it makes me nervous to think about the results, it is a tense situation and I think it is something that all patients experience
0.547600	The doctor might be concerned about what symptoms I've been having. I never know when my health might change. 
0.523800	Usually I go to the doctorâs office for a reason â recently I had a skin cancer diagnosis â so Iâm obviously concerned about the results of a visit. Also, Iâm kind of getting tired of the hassle of healthcare. I have a growth that needs looked at â I know thatâs going to be at least four visits. The initial visit, another visit to get the growth removed, another visit to have a follow-up (either stitches removed or just a wound check for healing), and another check in a couple of months to make sure nothing is growing back. Iâm not anxious about regular check-ups very much.
0.261900	I wonder how the tests will come out. I wonder if my blood pressure is high, although its been normal for some time now. There is uncertainty. 
0.785700	They will tell me what I am doing wrong based off of what other people in my race do. A doctor told me to stop in fried chicken when that is something I rarely eat. Not all people of color eat or like fried chicken.
0.619000	A male OB/GYN threatened to impregnate me during an examination. He said he was joking, but I didn't go back to an OB/GYN for years after that because I would start to feel anxious while trying to make an appointment
0.881000	In my experience people go to the doctor because something is wrong. As someone who has an anxiety disorder anyway, going to someone who can confirm that a problem is real and something could be terribly wrong just stresses me completely out. 
0.857100	Just what they may find. Something that I wasn't expecting. Me needing a treatment I can't afford. Just the whole experience really. 
0.309500	I usually don't get anxious.  They only times that I really am worried or anxious is if I know I am going to a dr. that doesnt listen to me or I think won't.  Or if it is for one of my children and I know something is wrong with them.
0.761900	I am not e needle person. In fact my chart lets the nurses know I have a hard time with needles. I have high blood pressure, and have to get my blood drawn every now and then, so I worry about that.
0.523800	Just knowing that I may end up with a doctor who does not really want to take the time to listen to my complaints and will just try to push some drug on me makes me anxious.  I am not relaxed going in just thinking about that.
0.500000	Mainly the outcome of the visit makes me nervous. As a person that has had a few medical conditions, it always makes me a little uneasy to have a check up not knowing if something is wrong again. Having to take additional tests, such as x-ray's or bloodwork is something that always makes me nervous. While I was sick I would be anxious before every appointment because I would be afraid that the doctor may have found something cancerous or seriously life threatening. 
0.785700	I am worried that there will be something wrong with me.  I am worried that I will walk out sick or on several medications.  
0.833300	That their profits are more concerning than my health. that they would rather me be on 17 different pills , all with adverse side effects than smoke a few joints a day which has a better effect at my treatment.
0.190500	With me getting up in age I get more worried then I did when I was younger. Any kind of symptoms that I'm having now I sometimes think the worst and that I'm seriously ill.  
0.523800	I get apprehensive about what they may tell me about my test results, and how I will react if the news is bad.
0.476200	I think I feel apprehensive whenever I have to reschedule an appointment or have to wait far longer than anticipated prior to seeing the doctor or when having to wait while s/he checks on a particular result.
0.547600	I feel a little anxious about doctor visits in general. The clinical setting makes me feel a little uncomfortable and it usually ends up being a source of work for myself later in order to continue my healthcare. 
0.523800	I feel anxious and worried that perhaps someone will make a mistake that very well could have been avoided.
0.761900	I think that doctors ask many questions. Also, they search for abnormalities. This can make me feel uneasy because I don't know what the next observation or diagnosis will be regarding my health issues. Also, I feel uneasy when I have to have my blood pressure checked. 
0.428600	Knowing that you will likely find out what is wrong with you and hoping that it's not something expensive or bad. Also, hoping you get worthwhile information out of going in relation to the cost of going. Or the possibility of having to feel pain from procedures.
0.952400	Even though it hasn't been diagnosed, I'm certain that I've got some form of an anxiety disorder, so I'm pretty much always on edge when visiting the doctor's office. I'm a pretty modest person (and being asexual probably doesn't help this), so anything that involves getting a little too touchy-feely makes me extremely uncomfortable. For instance, I know that I should really visit a gynecologist or the like, but the thought of it freaks me out too much. I actually took far longer than I should have to go to the doctor about my IBS before I knew what it was, because I was afraid that I'd have to have a colonoscopy or something similar (as mentioned earlier, I was fortunate that my doctor also suffers from it, so as soon as I started talking about my symptoms, she knew exactly what it was).
0.690500	Mainly I worry that my good luck has finally run out and they find a major medical issue that has to be dealt with.  Possible crippling financial costs of a discovered medical issue causes me considerable worry.
0.142900	I feel nervous when something is physically wrong with me and I have no idea what it is. I get nervous when I know it could be a costly visit as well. 
0.333300	As dumb as it sounds, what worries me the most is what the doctor's will find.  Kind of the concept that ignorance is bliss, if I don't go then I don't have to worry about whatever is going on in my body.  I also don't like having fasting blood draws, so if I can avoid those I generally feel a lot better.  In addition, if it's not a standard wellness visit, generally you already know there's something wrong and I worry it might be more serious than it is.
0.285700	I don't generally feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I am satisfied with the service and am treated well by everyone there. I don't feel negative about the experience.
0.547600	When the doctor recommends that I take some medication that I am not very familiar with. I read about some possible side-effects but my doctor does not seem very affected by that. That makes me worried because I'm unsure if something may be a big deal or not.
0.404800	When I visit my Doctor I'm worried that he will find something seriously wrong with me. He is upfront about my health issues and wouldn't hold back if he found some thing wrong with me. 
0.357100	I rarely feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. My health is reasonable and most issues are fairly common at this point. 
0.761900	Getting a new diagnoses or starting new treatment always sucks.  Waiting for them to come in with lab results is always a worrisome time too, not knowing if things are going the way we scare hoping and the anticipation is scary,
0.285700	Aside from the tedious visits which is a constant reminder that I am a cancer patient, I have no qualms other than that I do not work and my income is low which makes daily living sometimes unbearable.  I was a vibrant 62 year old with my own home a gorgeous leased vehicle and then in an instant I was a cancer patient.  It was not how I envisioned my life to be and was hopeful that I would work until full retirement age of 66 or later.  Visiting the cancer center is not a big deal.
0.261900	Iâm generally not worried about going to the doctorâs office. I would only become worried if a doctor gave me a reason to be after an examination. I donât necessarily go into the appointment worried 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting doctor's office. I believe and trust in god. I am going to tell my issues and the doctor might help me based on her knowledge.
0.881000	I can't really explain what makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. I am nervous when I go there no matter what. It doesn't matter if I have a current health issue or not. Getting my blood taken amps up my anxiousness though because I am afraid of needles. I always feel like I'm going to get bad news at the doctor. I think a lot of it has to do with my father and how he ended up dying. He had cardiovascular disease and me and all of my siblings also have some form of it. I lost 3 siblings this past year from heart related issues with no warning signs. 
0.285700	I always have a fear in the back of my mind of finding something wrong about my health. Both sides of my parents have a history of diabetes, and my mother's side have a history of cancer so anytime I go for a check up I worry about finding out that I may have it.
0.214300	Though not prone to hypochondria, there is something about waiting for information about your health when you are at the doctor's office for other than a routine checkup...
0.523800	I worry because when I go to the doctor it is usually because i have been having some symptoms and the doctor is going to tell me what is wrong, and I dont want anything to be wrong
0.881000	"I am worried about something very bad being wrong with me, and the potential that it will hurt me, my family, or cost lots of money and time.  If something very bad is wrong, all of those things I just mentioned will cause even more anxiety, every day without going away for a long time.  I am worried about how this will be perceived by my doctors. I am not this sort of people on a daily basis when I am ""fine"", I am most anxious in the doctors office because when I am there, it is because something is already potentially wrong.  Doctors generally try to prescribe anxiety or anti-depressants which I continually turn down for various reasons.  So then I an anxious about how they perceive me, and about how that they are wrong about what they are thinking about me overall."
0.523800	Well, if I'm going to the doctor's office (other than for a routine checkup) it's because I think something is wrong. If I think something is wrong, I'm worried about what that might be! Although usually they don't find anything to start with, then it's rounds of tests and exams and more uncertainty, which is stressful.
0.381000	My biggest fear is that I have something terminal and that when they examine me they will discover something terrible.  I am very anxious to get the results of tests and screenings.
0.642900	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I also have been gaining weight and get nervous when I have to get on a scale anymore. I don't want to be unhealthy.
0.738100	I have never enjoyed going to the doctor. I feel like their is a lack of privacy and sensitivity. Sometimes you are made to feel like just a body and not a person. And of course, worrying that something might be wrong with you.
0.476200	That I will end up with another short term solution and no clear answer. In three months I will be in the same situation and he will just do the same thing and I don't see progress.
0.428600	Just getting routine check ups makes me nervous because I have been really sick as of late. I had a tumor before and lately I have been sick along those same lines again.
0.547600	Their standard assessment equipment sometimes causes errors in obtaining vital signs.  The doctor often will not re-check the vitals and my anxiety usually causes my blood pressure to read higher than it is. I get anxious when they try to give me new medication for something that hasn't been examined and followed through properly.
0.523800	I don't know exactly why I just get a little nervous when I go to the doctor or the dentist.  I am nervous and then I am relieved when I find out I am okay.  even if there's an issue, I am still relieved.  I think that just not knowing, and uncertainty about one's health is nerve-wracking.
0.309500	If I have all of my children with me Iâm only anxious that they will behave.  Iâm sometimes anxious that if I donât agree with what the doctor says I wonât feel bold enough to question it to their face.  I feel anxious when thereâs a disconnect between what they believe about a topic and what I believe.  I donât want to appear like I know more than the doctor, like I question their authority.  I feel anxious about not being in agreement with the doctor because I want to do what is right.  I donât like feeling like I have to go research on my own to make that determination.  
0.642900	I have generalized anxiety disorder and usually am always full of anxiety even if there is nothing wrong. What makes me the most anxious is the uncertainty of each visit. I Always expect the worst in every visit thinking something is seriously wrong with me. I cannot control this fear.  
0.738100	The first worrying thought in my mind is always the possibility of being told some new negative information, such as my health has worsened or I have developed some entirely new health complication. I also don't like the thought of having to need some new medication since I'm already on several. Other than that, one of the main things that I'm always anxious about is the possibility of having to get a blood exam, since I am extremely terrified of needles.
0.547600	I mostly worry about the germs I'm getting sitting in the waiting room. I also do not enjoy the shots that come along with physicals. They tend to give me anxiety but I do not necessarily have a problem with the doctor, nurse, or the wait time when I do have an appointment. 
0.428600	Getting weighed every single time makes me anxious. My white coat blood pressure makes me anxious... I tell the person who takes my blood pressure before the doctor comes in to wait a few minutes and ask me the standard questions and refer to my online chart BEFORE taking my blood pressure. But-they never listen to me, take it anyway and it comes out high. Then when the doctor comes in I tell him that told the assistant again to wait to take my bp(for the umpteenth time) and he takes it and it's fine.
0.642900	When a doctor tells me that they are concerned about something and we need to run tests. Then when those tests take forever to come back with the results. That is the worst feeling.
0.666700	That I will find out something negative or bad about my health. Not only would it be bad healthwise, but it would cost more money. And more medical bills is a nightmare in the US. 
0.190500	i was quiet tensed if my health condition is not good. Even though it is small issue and it is not healing for many days that time i felt very disappointed. So at this type of issues i worried a lot. And each time i visit doctors office i was feeling like at least this time the problem should resolved. And also i was anxious about injections.
0.381000	I worry maybe my blood work might come back with something wrong. Otherxious.than that I usually am not anxious.
0.666700	If somethings bothering me, my biggest concern is that the doctor won't really give it too much attention and that they'll just brush it off and maybe give me a prescription that won't really help that much. I worry that i'll have to live with something that's bothering me just based off the fact that a doctor wants to get on with his  day without putting much thought into my problems. 
0.619000	I think I would mostly be worried or uneasy about not knowing what is wrong with me medically, and waiting for the tests to come back, or finish the doctor's examination before I can find out what is going on. So, it's mostly just a case of uncertainty or a fear of the unknown.
0.142900	I feel the most anxious when I'm at the doctor's office and have to have blood tests. I usually end up getting light headed and fainting. I am terrible with blood and the nurse must give me some smelling salts to get me back. It's terrible, i'm the most queazy person on earth and it is so embarrassing. I am trying to overcome my fears.
0.523800	Waiting for annual blood lab results to monitor specific conditions - if the doctor does not get back to me promptly with reassurance and feedback or interpretation, that makes me anxious. 
0.476200	Anytime you enter a doctor's office for an ailment it's always nerve wracking. You do not know what's wrong, and for me being in the medical field I always think of the worst conditions. It's almost like the people that google their symptoms and freak out. It's definitely harder waiting for test results knowing what's out there and how many people you file claims for that actually have these ailments. It makes you very uneasy. The anticipation is very unnerving.  
0.404800	Even though I feel fine, there's always lingering doubt in my mind. Like I'll get some bad news or he'll tell me I have some disease or medical issue I wasn't anticipating.
1.000000	Like I said, I think I'm a kind of hypochondriac. It's very easy to convince myself I have any disease I hear of, and so I just want to avoid the whole situation, like going to the doctor will make it worse. Also, I've had really bad experiences with doctors mistreating my family members.
1.000000	I absolutely detest anyone touching me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach and sends my mind reeling even just sitting here thinking about it. I don't want any doctor disregarding or disrespecting my body autonomy. I would 100% avoid any circumstance where a doctor could even touch my arm.
0.785700	I tend to overthink every little situation. It's not the visit to the doctor's office that worries me or makes me anxious. It's the diagnosis that scares me. Whenever I catch something or develop a cold, my mind always seems to convince me that it's something serious. So, of course, my trips to the doctor have me feeling very anxious until I get a proper diagnosis and realize it's not that bad.
0.976200	I'm most anxious about weighing myself. I have really bad body issues and haven't been able to lose pregnancy weight. 
0.500000	The thing I find most worrisome is a doctor not being able to recognize the symptoms of what I may be going through
0.476200	I am most worried about going to the doctor when there is nothing really wrong.  I am most anxious to go to the doctor and be told that there is nothing wrong and it's all in my head.
0.714300	What worries me most when going to the doctor's office is not knowing what it is that they will be doing and what they will find.  I also find it somewhat unsettling to have a stranger looking me over and touching me. 
0.357100	The thought of the doctor finding something else wrong that I wasn't aware of or couldn't fathom. I don't like surprises like that.
0.333300	Sometimes I encounter health professionals that blow of my symptoms so any worry is about getting them to investigate my symptoms instead of ignoring them.
0.500000	I'm a person who has anxiety to begin with, so the uncertainty of what they might find makes me even more anxious.  It's also time spent away from the family, and that is something that makes me anxious as well.
0.571400	School and my future makes me feel worried about my future. There is a lot of pressure I have going on in my life and it can be a little too much at times.
0.690500	It is not comfortable being poked and prodded, so I always get anxious about that. And then I start thinking what if something shows up? There is a level they watch in my blood work and I worry it has fallen and I will have to go to a specialist. 
0.714300	I am worried when checking up on chronic conditions, wanting to make sure that I am not about to hear bad news about my health. I think a doctor's office inherently makes people nervous. 
0.904800	I am nervous that they are going to find a major issue with my health. I am also nervous that they will miss something major with my health. 
0.738100	I just always feel like there might be something wrong that they are going to discover and that puts me on edge. 
0.404800	Just being in a random cold room makes me nervous. I am also anxious about what it is i have that made me go to the doctor in the first place. I always worry it's going to be something huge.
0.142900	Doctors can be very pleasant to be around but many can also be untrustworthy.  It has been that way for all time and it wouldn't just suddenly halt one day.  Doctors can make sure that they are giving you a prescription that may not be the best for you as long as it is the best for them. 
0.642900	I just dont like talking about personal things with other people so it makes me anxious in general, not just because they are a doctor.
0.190500	Generally, I don't feel anxiety when I go to the doctor.  I take very good care of myself and I have good sense of when something is wrong.  It is only in those moments where I don't know what is behind a mystery ache or pain that I feel anxious.  
0.285700	I really do not feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, other than the off chance that there might be a serious illness and not just a routine sickness going on. Although I tend to be optimistic that most things I would experience are very treatable. 
0.547600	The doctor makes me wait in the back room for hours. The room is often too warm and my health issues do not do well in extreme temperatures.
0.261900	i am sometimes feeling so because i don not know what he is going to say this time. one thing about doctors is that they must see what is wrong with your body. so going to them can make think ahead what to hear from them
0.142900	I guess just knowing that I didn't hit the weight goal that I had for myself. I gained weight while I was pregnant and haven't completely lost all of that weight.
0.333300	Its entirelt possible that my health is such that the my doctor might find a problem that will be of major concern to me. Luckily I have never left the doctors office with such worries as my doctor has always been upfront with me about my health.
0.547600	I think the possibility of them finding something like a tumor or cancer.  Also I feel like they judge me for not being healthier or in better shape
0.857100	When visiting a doctor's office, I'm mainly afraid of 1) how uncomfortable the examination or procedure may be, and 2) any possible bad news I may receive as a result/following the examination.  Usually everything else (work, payment for services, etc.) is secondary.
0.500000	Im always worried im going to have something major wrong with me or they will find something very wrong with me.  I also scared i may have an infection of some sort.
0.142900	There really was nothing that made me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If anything, the only unpleasant part about visiting the doctor's office is the wait.
0.142900	I don't think I ever feel anxious or worried. I think if I did, the only reason would be if my blood work panels came back normal. My doctor always treats me with respect and I never feel apprehensive or anxious to go to the doctor. 
0.309500	Finding out something is terribly wrong with me would be very bad news. I'm very relieved every time this is not the case. It's best to check things early and practice preventative care instead of be late to treat something after it develops.
0.523800	I was anxious and worried that they were going to tell me that I was going to need surgery for my tonsils a few years ago because I had constant sore throats.  My PCP was able to make a great decision with me about not having surgery because it would not have helped in the situation.
0.857100	The biggest thing that I fear is finding out that I am going to have a serious medical issue.  The longer I have to wait the worse it is.
0.619000	I worry that my doctor is going to give me potentially life threatening news. I'm left in the dark for most of my usually long visit and it just adds to my anxiety.
0.452400	I worried that there might be something wrong. I wonder if anything unexpected might come up.I worry about bad news. 
0.357100	I feel most anxious, or worried, about the fact that this is the place where I could potentially learn of something negative about my health, something life threatening, debilitating, etc. I know this is the place, and the doctor is the person, that this news will come from.
0.714300	Well if I am in a doctorâs office that generally means that I am hurt or sick and I cannot take care of it on my own. So I am worried that the illness or injury is going to be worse that I feared. 
0.619000	I always feel anxious at the doctor office, because I never know what they are going to find.  Even if I am healthy, I worry they may find something bad.
0.595200	I worry about them finding out that something is wrong. I've also had bad experiences at a hospital before so just being in the hospital or dr office makes me anxious as I relive those experiences.
0.690500	Getting a bad report.  I don't want to hear that I am not as healthy as I hoped to be. I feel there is more I could do to be healthier. 
0.547600	There is always the thought that the problem could be something worse than expected. Also I feel anxious that the problem will be something that cannot be fixed or something that will take a long time to recover from. 
0.690500	Remember that doctors are there to help you and try to solve your health problems. It's not their purpose to hurt you as much as possible. On the contrary, they will try to achieve what needs to be done with as little pain as possible. Yet some things just hurt. No doctor can change that, unfortunately. Try to pluck up courage s much ad possible and say to yourself: we're just gonna do it. I'm not gonna get beaten by a stupid needle!!! Try it, next time. It works and you will feel proud of yourself!
0.904800	Because you never know if they may tell you that it's something wrong with you. This is the reason why many people don't go to the dr's office as much as they should. We hate and fear hearing bad news.  Even just the thought of it makes a person feel at ease almost instantly.
0.619000	"I use to feel very anxious when visiting the doctor as a child. I often had no idea what to expect and I often wondered what would happen if they couldn't figure out what was making me sick. Today the anxiety that I faced as a child has been greatly diminished. My current doctor and his office is really great about setting forth a game plan. Before any exam happens I'll be told what to expect so I'm not going into anything blind. Once the exam is over I'm given options on the course of treatments that are available. There is still some small part of me that gets worried before I'm seen because I roll through the ""what if they can't figure out what's wrong with me"" bit in my head. I've come to discover that this is unfounded which helps with future visits."
0.333300	Waiting for the doctor to see me while being exposed to possible diseases from the other patients waiting. 
0.666700	I worry that my symptoms or the reasons why I came to the doctor's office will turn out to be more serious than I had thought.  I worry that it might be a bigger disease or issue.
0.690500	I am a germiphobe, and I really hate even going to a doctor's office. That is probably what makes me feel the most anxious. I am always a little worried they'll find something wrong with me, too.
0.714300	Just the thought that i should of come sooner. I blame myself for putting it of. Its always a bit nerve wracking getting examined  when you think something could be wrong with you. 
0.285700	If he seems distracted or not really about getting my input about my situation. I don't have this issue with my regular doctor but occasionally I might have to see someone else.
0.500000	Whether they find something wrong as well as if my insurance will cover the visit and what i'll have to pay out of pocket
0.881000	I get judged a lot.  My chronic condition involved weight gain.  I often feel the doctors see only the weight gain and not the person  
0.452400	Sometimes when I don't feel like I can quite specifically or accurately describe what's going on. When I feel like my concerns are too vague.
0.381000	I'm anxious about there might be something wrong with my body. It's not about my doctors, at most time, they performed a great job
0.500000	I'm worried that are going to find something horribly wrong about my health.  I am scared to receive bad news.  I'm also concerned that the doctor will recommend treatments I am uncomfortable with.  Also I am concerned the doctor will be irritated if I question such treatments.  
0.285700	Only if I am unable to see my regular doctor and the doctor I see seems preoccupied with other things and other patients. I want someone who is focused on me and my issues. 
0.619000	I am always fearful about a bad prognosis. I am also always working to avoid high blood pressure so consequently doctor visits tend to send my blood pressure up.
0.571400	I'm mostly uncomfortable having an unknown person examine my body.  This makes me anxious to be done with it as quickly as possible.
0.666700	"I see a doctor for one of two things: an unusual symptom or condition, or an annual checkup. During the former, I sometimes wonder if my symptoms could indicate a more serious medical problem, or worry how long the condition might persist, even with treatment. In the latter, a ""wellness check"", I worry that I may have an unrecognized problem that will affect my overall health, or require extensive and/or expensive treatment. Since I am typically in very good physical condition, the thought of being ill bothers me a lot."
0.357100	Mostly that I'll forget to ask all of the questions that I have in mind or that I won't understand what the doctor is telling me and that I'll be too afraid to ask for a better explanation.
0.333300	There is no benefit to worrying.  I completely agree and fully realize that most of my worries are ridiculous, but that does not make a difference; I still worry.  I've been trying to stop worrying my entire life.  It is uncontrollable. I have booked an appointment with my doctor, though I can already feel the anxiety building, and have been trying to distract myself.  I worry that he won't believe me, or something else.  It is embarrassing, and I feel bad about it.
0.595200	I have a slight fear about needles and not a lot of tolerance with pain. I always have a feeling that if I have to go see a doctor I will need to have needles stuck in me and that makes me nervous. Also, doctors' offices and environments are often unpleasant and do not help one feel more at ease.
0.309500	The longer I wait, the more anxious I become. As I become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me tto become even more stressed.
0.595200	Don't like taking my clothes off. Don't like waiting for doctor. Don't like being weighed. Don't like being told to lose weight.
0.714300	Depending on the reason for the visit, the illness itself is enough to cause such extreme anxiety. Add in the process of divulging highly personal information to people you barely know and you have a recipe for tension.
0.428600	My family has a long history of heart trouble, in particular high blood pressure, so I am always anxious when I go in for a physical that now will be my time to start down the heart disease path.  I also worry about mammograms. I haven't had any diagnoses that justify my concern, but I do nonetheless.
0.619000	I'm always worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me that I didn't know about or that the doctor will criticize some part of how I live or what I should or shouldn't be doing with my life. 
0.619000	A combination of mild social anxiety and worrying that something will turn out to be not right with me, for example, my blood pressure being too high or something like that. I care a lot about my health, so having it examined is a high-stakes thing for me.
0.690500	I'm afraid it will be a complete waste of my time and money, and they will fail to figure out whats wrong with me or help me try to figure out some solutions.  I'll leave the doctors office poorer and no better off healthwise.  I also don't like it and worry about when it takes them a month or two to schedule mroe advance procedures like go see a neurologist to deal with right now problem.  I pay them copay to have them tell me to go see another doctor...
0.809500	I usually worry about my health and having to interact and explain myself to doctors and nurses. Visiting a doctor's office is also usually a big interruption in my usual daily routine, which makes me anxious. 
0.285700	I usually don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, since I know I am in good hands.If necessary I know the doctor would refer me to someone who would be as caring  and efficient as her.
0.523800	If I have to get naked or show my crotch that makes me the most nervous.  If I have to get blood drawn that will also make me a bit nervous as I am not a big fan of needles.  My biggest hesitation when seeing a dr. is how much the treatment is going to cost.
0.595200	I am worried that I might find out that I have a serious and expensive disease like cancer.  If I had cancer it would complete change how I live my life.
0.190500	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, but I have prayed a lot before going to one. Going to get the results back from blood tests has made me feel a little uneasy, because I wondered what my primary care physician was going to tell me about the results, but I know that I am healed by the stripes of Jesus and I knew that I was going to be alright.  I think just waiting for the results and wondering what they are can cause a little bit of uneasiness. 
0.976200	I am worried about the doctor telling me I may have a disease or a condition with no cure.  I dont like people examining me.  I cant afford medical treatment.
0.833300	The fact that I might have something wrong with me but they will not notice it or even care to do a follow up on it. Also I can sense their lack of caring and that troubles me a lot as well.
0.285700	If is my first appointment for this event that I have never been in before and I am not sure what the doctor is going to tell me that I need to do or what the results may be so I will feel a bit nervous or worried
0.428600	I think it's just the concept that you may be of ill-health and that's a very troubling and worrisome thought for anyone.
0.428600	Not seeing my doctor is not the problem. It is the actual diagnosis of what my illness is that makes me nervous.
0.142900	I am rarely nervous or worried when I see him. Again this is because I have full confidence in him. The only time I am anxious is if they are going to take blood from me or I will be receiving a injection shot for something. 
0.142900	The only thing that would make me feel anxious or worried is if I had something that I did against the direction of my doctor. I would feel bad and not want to see my doctor.
0.238100	The only thing that makes me anxious is not knowing how much time I will have to wait to see the doctor. I usually have to wait 1-1/2 to 2 hours to see her despite having an appointment. Once, a few years ago, I missed an important meeting at work because I wrongly assumed that my doctor's visit would be over in about an hour; it ended up being 2 hours because I had to wait a long time to see her, and my actual time with her was about 15 minutes. 
0.166700	I feel that I have a pretty good bead on what is wrong with me medically.  I am never really expecting anything groundbreaking or life changing to happen or be told to me.  A doctors office visit for me is more of a chore then anything else.
0.285700	Nothing really anymore.  In the past it use to be getting on the scale, but now it does not bother me.
0.404800	My primary issue with having current Western medical practices applied to me is that medical schools do not address a wide enough spectrum of healing modalities. And if they do, they charge a lot for their services. Around here, MD/NDs charge far too much for me to afford. So, I'm left with the choice of visiting a doctor who is instructed in a more narrow treatment spectrum, which does not suit my approach to health. As a result, I'm worried and anxious, because I know how many doctors react if you question their advice.
0.166700	The thing I am most worried about is getting sick from other people while at the doctor's office.  I usually take herbal supplements and colloidal silver to overcome this issue.  The other thing I get worried about is the doctor not listening to what I have to say and then brushing me off as it's time to go the next patient.
0.809500	I am always anxious when it comes to an office setting. I feel like there could be anything wrong with anyone at any certain time and that is nerve wracking. I fear that I will hear the worst and have to go under surgery or something like that. 
0.428600	I do not often feel worried about visiting the physician. Sometimes, however, I would worry about a potentially serious diagnosis. I do not think this is uncommon, however, and it arises from a childhood fear I had of being diagnosed with a terminal disease like my uncle (cancer).
0.857100	Not knowing what the outcome is going to be is what makes me the most nervous. They sit their and run their tests, sometimes not talking very much, so you can only sit there and think that something is seriously wrong with you. I always fear for the worst, every single time. Be a use in most cases people usually get the worst news of their lives, from their doctors.
0.904800	Doctor's, Dentist's, They all make me anxious and worried. I'm not exactly sure WHAT MAKES me feel this way. Maybe the unknown? I just have a fear of doing things like this. Makes me very nervous!
0.761900	I am worried about the what the Doctor may tell me about the conditions that are currently affecting me.  I am worried that I have not seen a doctor regularly for a long time.
0.571400	I do not really feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If I ever have, it would have been for some symptom or pain with unknown origin that I did not know what was wrong with me and wanted to get to the bottom of it.
1.000000	That the doctor may find a tumor or tell me that I have a major health illness. Even if I do not trust what the doctor is saying, this is enough to scare me and make me feel like I'm going to die! I think the entire situation of being in a dr office is intimidating. I am not sure if this is designed on purpose but the environment makes you extra anxious.  The whole waiting period amplifies this. 
0.238100	I am worried that they will find something serious that is wrong with me. I dont think its a very rational fear because I am in very good health but it is something that always lingers in the back of my mind while i am waiting in the waiting room at the doctor's office. I usually just want to get in, get treated, and get out as quickly as possible so that I can go back home.
0.476200	I am often worried of the things that I will learn. I feel grim or hopeless at times and my doctor is there for me. They listen, explain and let me ven't without judging in any way. I am often scared to face certain things or news, but in reality, it's life and u can get thru anything.
0.285700	The possibility of having a health complication that will affect my day to day life. It would be very unpleasant to hear that I would have to take medication for the rest of my life for a health condition.
0.333300	I have not been with this doctor for an extended period f time. I need to spend a little more time underneath the care of this particular provider, in order to have complete faith in them.
0.714300	I am concerned that while conducting an examination he will find something seriously wrong with me. Usually I go right after getting blood work and I am always concerned that the findings will be very bad and it makes me extremely anxious
0.333300	That they will find I have a serious condition that will adversely affect my lifestyle either due to treatments or illness. 
0.476200	i hate a new doctors visit and the nurse practitioner i saw was a different one then the on i saw a few years back at the same facility 
0.381000	Most of the time myself and many people visit doctor's offices is because there is something wrong, so being examined for the problem you've been having can make you slightly anxious or worried of the outcome of the examination. While it's great to potentially get answers for medical problems, you can get informed that what you're experiencing is worse than you expected. I believe that is typically in the back of the minds of most people in a doctor's care.
0.714300	I think the waiting process in doctor's offices make me the most nervous, or anxious. For example, waiting in the lobby for an appointment, or waiting for shots or a lab result. The feeling of not knowing what to expect, or what the staff is going to tell you can be nerve-wracking.
0.571400	When I get my blood pressure taken. I am getting older so hypertension is a real concern. I am trying to cut down on sodium intake and exercising more to keep myself health. But my job is somewhat stressful so my blood pressure goes up and down sometimes. Waiting to hear my result makes me feel uneasy.
0.857100	I always feel anxious when I go there and they have to run a lot of test on me and draw my blood.  It seems they can never find a good vein to draw from and end up sticking me in several places.  My arm s usually black and blood when they are done.
0.642900	 The thing that worries me the most is the bill I'll receive. Every passing minute I'm in that office, every procedure or drug prescribed is more money that I probably can't afford to pay even with insurance. I shouldn't have to focus on that but rather be focused on why I'm there in the first place. I seriously doubt I'm in the minority who think this way.
0.333300	If there is something wrong I am worried of the outcome, of any possible conditions or complications. Going to the Doctors sitting there mostly naked is the most comfortable experience.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried about visiting the doctors office. I know my doctor and his staff very well. We live in a very rural area and know each other well. My doctor has never made me feel uncomfortable of like I wasn't important. I've never had to wait a long time to be seen or treated poorly. 
0.476200	there is always the chance of the unknown no matter how healthy you feel or how well you think you are doing following your health Regine.
0.666700	I am usually concerned with having a high blood pressure. My father had White Coat syndrome, and I fear that I have inherited that from him. I do not like the sterile waiting rooms.
0.571400	i don't feel anxious or worried at all if i am just having a visit or have only a small problem that is not serious.   if i had a serious problem, then i would be worried and maybe have a second opinion after their diagnosis of me
0.381000	High costs is a factor that always brings on a fair amount of worry .I haven't had any real major health issues/ I think it's a natural thing to be somewhat anxious and worried when it comes to my health.
0.690500	I just have always been anxious when going to the doctor.  It feels like an invasion of privacy, even though I know it is for the best.  
0.428600	The only thing that I worry about when I go are basically health problems that are new and I really hate going to the OBGYN because it's uncomfortable.
0.595200	I think most people feel that way.  You never know what they will find and it is an anxious feeling every time.
0.690500	I'm in pretty good health, but my family genes worry me when I go in. I feel as though that coupled with my sometimes bad diet is finally going to catch up to me. That is what worries me when I go in for tests and bloodwork the most right now as I'm getting older.
0.190500	the only thing that makes me anxious if when I have to get any type of shot or have to have my blood drawn. I think this makes me feel anxious as I never look forward to having this done. 
0.666700	Visiting the doctor's office gets me focused on health issues I don't usually think about extensively but that just pass through my mind. It gets me thinking about what I might not be able to know about my health no matter how much I pay attention to my body and also that I might not be paying as much attention as I should.
0.381000	The most anxious part of a doctor's appointment is not knowing exactly what to expect.  As someone who is highly organized and detail oriented, I tend to get anxious when I find myself in an unfamiliar situation or surroundings and am not sure what to expect.
0.928600	I know that it will be very rushed, and that I will almost certainly not get all of my concerns addressed during the visit.
0.309500	What makes me most anxious is the unknown. It isn't the actual checkup, it's the potential that something could be wrong with me or that a symptom could be serious. I don't do well with uncertainty so I need straight answers instead of wait and watch or unknowns.
0.833300	I don't like to go to any doctor or hospital for any reason not even to visit someone else. I worry that they will find something bad so I do not like to go get a physical and I avoid the doctor's office as much as possible. They always have a pill for everything and I feel some prescription drugs take away the body's ability to heal itself. 
0.428600	I have a great doctor I just don't like going in general so that tends to make me feel anxious, but he's efficient and answers my questions and I usually leave wondering why I was so stressed out
0.404800	There is a lot of anxiety simply in not knowing for sure if your specific doctor (or your doctor that day) has your best interest at heart. They could be having a bad day, and overlook a serious problem. They could not take your truthful complaints serious, and give you a false clean bill of health. There is so much uncertainty at any given moment, it is impossible to not be nervous, worried, or anxious. 
0.142900	I worry that I may catch something from another patient like the flu while at the doctors office. If I'm having an unusual pain I worry that maybe something is really wrong and I'm about to find out what it is from my doctor.
0.761900	I feel the waiting is the hardest part and I always don't know what to expect and will spend some time worrying if there is something more serious than I think going on. The longer I have to wait the more time I have to worry about things I probably shouldn't be worrying about in the first place.
0.333300	Finding out something bad might be wrong with me. One time I went over back pain and found out I had herniated discs in my back that also causes sciatica now
0.809500	I fear they are going to find something terribly wrong with me. I fear that when they find something terribly wrong with me the treatment is going to be unpleasant. Even when I already know more or less what is wrong, I fear that the treatment is going to be unpleasant. I fear side effects of medication, and don't want to have to take more.
0.690500	Every time i go with some pain, i am thinking the worst case scenario. I dont like going to doctors office at all.
0.714300	I'm of course worried about receiving bad news.  And also of feeling like the experience itself wasn't very good.  I want to feel important and respected, and I rarely feel that way at the doctor's office.
0.381000	I'm not used to people poking me and prodding me. I also realize that I'm often being judged by my outside (since I don't wear makeup, will they assume I'm depressed?), that my outside figure doesn't reflect my habits (yes, I weight 175 lbs. And, yes, I go running multiple times a week. Both are true), and that some of my statements will be considered lies (people believe me when I say I don't smoke, they mostly believe me when they say I don't drink, but I'm pretty sure no one believes me when I tell them I'm a virgin). 
0.523800	What makes me anxious or worried is fear of the unknown.  What will she find?  Is there something wrong with me?  And what might the consequences be of any illness.  Basically, fear of the unknown.  I don't fear getting scolded for bad health behavior.
0.190500	I get anxious while visiting the doctor because I want to make sure that everything is all right and that my pressure is not up. And that I don't need any medication to function.
0.238100	I hate needles! When I have to get a needle I get panicky. It's hard to explain because I have tattoos but, needles at the doctors are so different.
0.738100	I feel most anxious or worried when I have symptoms that might indicate a serious health condition. One of my doctor's nurses is a little unfriendly, so I feel anxious if she is the one who takes my vitals or draws my blood. Also, I feel worried about catching the flu from other patients at the doctor's office.
0.261900	The idea that whatever is ailing me could be a terminal illness but those thoughts don't enter too often.
0.547600	i feel it a little bit of anxious or worried and it is due to the uncertainty that i feel that what can happen and imagine the worst case .
0.381000	When I was pregnant last year i went to see my doctor very often and I was always worried about being told there was something wrong with the baby. I didn't really care about me as much as i cared about my baby
0.166700	I don't like appointments and I prefer to get them over with and move on with the rest of my day as quickly as possible.
1.000000	The fear of being told something could be seriously wrong with my health is the main thing that stresses me out. Another factor is, being a person who has struggled with eating disorders, being told the number on the scale, whether it is higher or lower than I expect, gives me so much anxiety. After hearing the number, I don't think about anything else and I usually revert to bad behavior. Anything that involves my weight puts me on edge - it's very triggering for me and, unfortunately, hearing information about it form a doctor is very important, so it is inevitable that I become nervous during a visit.
0.642900	I have an anxiety disorder, and it's actually the waiting room that's the biggest issue for me. It's always full of other patients and there are no windows and only one exit. I have one of those faces where I seem approachable, and people always try to talk to me which makes it worse.
0.285700	If I have new or strange symptoms going on, I would feel worried. Since we have some diseases in our DNA, I am often afraid of what might occur.
0.642900	I always imagine and fear the worst. When I had my diabetes problems I was very concerned about my long term life and how it would affect my lifestyle.  
0.595200	Not knowing what he will find, and the cost of any treatment that might need to be done. My family has a history of health issues and I am afraid I might follow suit.
0.857100	Because they hold the key to knowledge i am unaware of so giving up control to random people is fearful and naked. Putting trust in a stranger for my well being is also not as controlling as I typically like and i know i am my own best fighter. The sickness that i am walking into at a doctors office is also seems like i will walk out worse than i walk in it seems counterintuitive to what im looking for.
0.309500	I just worry that something could be wrong even though I know there's little chance of that being the case.
0.357100	If I am sick, I am always anxious about what it could be and also I feel anxious that I may catch the flu or a stomach bug from someone who is there. This is something that makes me most anxious. 
0.523800	When I go to the doctors office, I will often feel a bit anxious. This is mostly because there are plenty of illnesses that can come up unexpectedly and I'm afraid that something bad will happen to me.
0.714300	I am a very private person so talking to anyone about health issues usually causes me some anxiety.  Also, I am relatively healthy and only have to go to the doctor on rare occasions, so it's just not something I am used to.
0.309500	The most anxious or worried I can get when I go to the doctor is that  the doctor will say that is something wrong.  Or give me a hard time about weight or diet.
0.381000	I am afraid that I will embarrass myself, that they will discover something wrong with me that requires painful treatment or puts my life in danger, or that some aspect of the examination will be painful

0.214300	Getting in and out! I am disabled and for some reason the office does not have an automatic door. Once in though, I feel quite relaxed.

0.142900	When I visit the doctor's office, I have no reason to feel anxious or worried. I have been in good health my whole life and have had almost no health issues.

0.523800	I go to the doctor when I am sick. I have never been for a wellness check or a physical. So I am already in at least some discomfort. I just want the problem to go away. Being sick in a place with other sick people is not comforting at all. I just want an answer. I know that the course of drugs will take a week or longer to really start working. So it all takes so long.
0.690500	The main thing that causes anxiety for me when going in for a doctors visit is the financial consequences that might come from my visit.

The other worry that arises is not knowing what kind of treatment I can expect and the time and effort that I might have to invest to treat the problem. 
0.833300	I feel uneasy if i am visiting a doctor and do not know what the test results will conclude. Also, I feel more uneasy to be examined by doctors when they perform more invasive testing (prodding/poking). If it's just a routine checkup, then i usually feel much easier/relaxed about it.

0.404800	Wondering if there's any new condition or if I am as healthy as I try to be. Hoping nothing comes up that would require a prescription or any medication that I can't remedy myself. I just hope all of my exams have good and positive results meaning good health.
0.476200	I am usually not that nervous or anxious when visiting any doctor but, am not that excited or comfortable either. I dont have any particular feelings it's just neccesary.
0.571400	It's always nerve wrecking when I visit a doctor's office because I don't know if there is something wrong with me. Most of it is the wait after you are examined and waiting for the results to come to me.
0.500000	I went to the emergency room several months ago because my feet were swollen for a few weeks and it was painful for me to walk or stand. In addition to the pain and swelling there was a very aggressive rash on both feet. After sitting in the ER for hours, the doctor told me I had athlete's foot. I followed his instructions and took the medications and one weeks later the condition only got worse. I went to my physician and was then told the problem was an extension of my eczema and that he would put in a referral for me  to see a dermatologist. After a few reminders and months later, I am still waiting to see a dermatologist.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious when visiting the doctor. Sometimes there's a weird feedback loop when taking blood pressure where I'm almost nervous that if I'm feeling nervous about my blood pressure being high I'll get an inaccurately high reading, which makes me a little nervous. It's pretty dumb and the nurse and I laugh about it.
0.809500	I don't always know what the doctor is going to tell me when I am there for a visit. There is no way of telling and they can sometimes be very blunt when telling you things that can really upset you. Once again, it goes back to their insane workload and the fact that they don't really have the time to form a genuine rapport with their patients.
0.285700	I never feel worried about going to the doctors. I am going there to be healed so not anxious at all. Maybe a little worried about the price but not seeing them
0.500000	Wondering if something is much worse than I think it is is probably the biggest thing for me to make me super anxious. I dont like that because who knows what the problem is.
0.595200	If I have some unknown pain I might think it is cancer or some other bad disease, but I have been lucky that I haven't had these conditions.
0.857100	I have intense anxiety anyway just normally anyway. Doctors certainly make it worse. A lot of it is simply discomfort around the stranger. Another part is the vulnerability.

0.190500	I am comfortable at the doctors office now that I have a doctor that I am confident in. Having a Dr who wont listen to me or who dismisses my symptomology is what makes me most uncomfortable at the dr
0.309500	If I'm not sure what is wrong with me. I will start overthinking it, or even worse using Web-MD before I go to get an estimate of what might be wrong. Nothing the doctor does makes me anxious, I make myself nervous.
0.238100	I worry about the cost of things sometimes and if things will be more expensive than what i am expecting
0.428600	I don't too much get anxious or worried during a doctor visit. I am normally completely at ease. I trust my provider so I;m sure that helps ease any worry or anxiety
0.309500	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.  I don't usually have a reason to be.  I know what to expect with my doctors.  They are straight forward and honest with me.  They will go over all of my options with me and discuss pros and cons of all of those options to help me to make an informed decision so there usually isn't a reason to be worried.
0.428600	I worry a lot about the cost. Medical care is so expensive, even with insurance, and there's no way to know how much things cost until the EOB arrives.
0.404800	I'm always there about something that is out of my control, and I have to trust that the person I'm seeing might be able to help with the situation.  I usually wait until problems build up, so there is also that urgency.
0.714300	That what the doctor diagnoses me with is serious or untreatable. Also, the environment itself in a doctors office usually makes me anxious or worried. 
0.928600	Being told that I'm a liar, or getting fat shamed. Being blamed for most of my issues. Getting treated like an idiot. I'm really sick of it but it happens every time.
0.238100	I am most anxious that my blood pressure will be high, or they'll find something I wasn't aware of having.
0.428600	Most of the time when I visit the doctor for anything other than routine physicals, I don't always feel I know how my treatment will go. It seems sometimes I have left the doctor's office being no closer to healed than I was when I entered.
0.476200	"I feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I""m afraid that I won't be believed, they simply won't care about my problem or that my individual concerns or needs will be ignored simply so they can see more patients that day. I'm afraid, anxious and desperate when they ignore me and my symptoms. So, if my original concern isn't addressed then I usually leave feeling physically as well as emotionally unwell after that. Subhuman almost that I don't matter enough to listen to. Then I question why I spent money to be ignored and still have the same symptoms that I walked in with."
0.547600	What causes me the most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor is both the chance of receiving very bad news and or receiving wrong information about my condition or lack of condition. Being misdiagnosed or not diagnosed with something i may need to be diagnosed with.
0.500000	I feel shy around strangers or people I don't know well. Additionally, I do not like needles, so the idea of getting blood drawn makes me tense. 
0.642900	Usually the thing that makes me most anxious is having to sit in a waiting room surrounded by sick people who are coughing and sneezing and being afraid I will catch something from them.
0.285700	What makes me feel most anxious is getting my blood pressure taken. I know I have good blood pressure but it always makes me nervous just in case this one time I don't. 
0.666700	You never know what they may find.  I always fear the cost of follow up appointments and the potential time that will be wasted.  Definitely not convenient.
0.738100	Even though I trust my doctor (and any of the specialists I see), I always get anxious about doctors appointments because there is always an element of unknown. There is always a chance they could discover something is wrong with you that is totally random and unrelated to what you came in for, and it could change your life. 
0.666700	I feel anxious when waiting for test results. The uncertainty of not knowing what is going on with my body makes me worried. I also dread having examinations where the doctor must physically touch my body.
0.261900	I am afraid that they are going to assume my condition and put me on a regimen without really trying to work on finding the issue.  I do not feel that doctors really look into things correctly. 
0.547600	I just feel anxious having like ten minutes to get my questions/concerns answered. And I don't have a good relationship with any of the doctor's I've had. 
0.714300	I'm afraid that my doctor is going to mess with my medications because they try that every few years.  I am concerned I am going to walk out with referrals to a bunch more doctors and/or more unnecessary testing.

0.428600	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is that I will be informed with information that details that I have a serious illness that may require drastic treatment or may have no treatment process that is successful at all. I do not like to take prescription medicines If I do not have too. I become fearful for my own health and would make decisions onwards that I hope will only benefit my health and help me move down a process of recovery. I would have faith in my doctor and hope that he/she takes the necessary precautions/procedures to help my recover from my illness as well. 
0.142900	I don't like waiting in the waiting room. But I especially hate waiting in the examining room where it is so cold and there's nothing to do while you wait. Plus the visits are too short to delve into any problems you may have. The doctors are always in a big hurry to see as many patients as they can so you feel like you're not anything special. I wouldn't care if the doctor just pretended to be interested in my problems as long as he/she showed any interest at all.
0.666700	I am worried that I will not understand what the doctor is talking about, especially if something is wrong with me. I am anxious about whether or not the doctor will take me seriously. 
0.428600	I hate shots. I am an adult and I just hate them. I get queasy and I know it is coming. I worry also about my insurance covering everything due to a medical bill in the past. 
0.904800	I'm afraid i'm going to get a bad diagnosis. The anxiety and dread of not knowing the condition i'm in is the worst. Also i'm worried about what type of mood my doctor is in, or how experienced and thorough the nurse is.

0.714300	Not knowing what new problem may have been discovered from recent lab work. I'm always a little anxious about what my blood pressure reading will be.
0.666700	I am most worried that I will be very sick because of an unwise activity I've engaged in or it will in some way be my fault. I do not want the doctor to judge me based on that.

0.619000	I'm afraid she will find something serious and then I will have to make decisions on what to do. I prefer not to think about such things.

0.619000	I worry that the doctor may miss something, or conversely, find something serious. I also worry that I will forget to ask the doctor about certain things.
0.666700	i feel anxious with the waiting i suppose, especially if something is wrong i want to know what it is, how serious, etc. spending time in the doctor's office isn't what i would be doing out of choice
0.500000	That would be getting bad news that I have a terminal illness or issue. Also just the rooms and materials in the office make me very anxious.
0.381000	The fear of finding out that there might be something more serious about my condition:). However, this is not always the case, it is only if I am seeing a doctor about a serious illness. 
0.381000	I am not anxious all the time, I was thinking more of a particular situation. I was having blood count issues. I had to keep going back for blood draws to see what my counts were at. one of the diagnosis for what i was going though could have been cancer. I was very nervous about getting those results
0.190500	Getting bad information that may cost me a lot of money or affect my life in the future. Having to go on a medication or something that may hinder my lifestyle in any way. 
0.476200	It's nothing in particular, usually. It's just a general concern that something could always be wrong that I'm not aware of. A doctor's office isn't usually a place you visit when things are going splendidly. 
0.142900	I don't have much fear or worry when I go to the doctor. I used to, before I started trusting Jesus. Now that I do trust Jesus, I give all my worries and concerns to him. I just go to the doctor for checkups, and I deal with whatever is said the best way I can.
0.738100	I am afraid that they will find something wrong with me that will be difficult to treat such as cancer, or that they won't look into my health needs as much as I'd like them too
0.523800	I don't like waiting for the doctor. I feel uncomfortable. I can also feel anxious about finding what is wrong with me

0.690500	Whenever I visit a doctors office I feel most nervous that the doctor is going to tell me to do something which will not help my condition or better understand my condition but instead just prescribe whatever is most fashionable or lucrative for himself. I am concerned that my best interest will not be taken into consideration. I am concerned about harmful and poorly understood medications being prescribed to me. 
0.619000	I guess just generally I don't want to find out that I'm sick because I don't have any money. I know that hospitals do tend to lower the costs for people with extremely low income like myself, but I'm scared to have to deal with that. 
0.333300	I'm mostly anxious about getting my blood drawn or shots. Sometimes I am anxious when the waiting area is very crowded, because I'm not sure when I will be seen and hope not to be rushed. Occasionally if I have a lot of concerns I'm worried I'll forget to ask everything on my mind.
0.523800	Just the thought of going to the doctor always has made me nervous and a fear of needles and such. Once I am in and see the doctor I am fine. 
0.881000	The possibility of my doctor diagnosing a health condition that could possibly change my life causes a lot of anxiety for me. I am also a very private person and do not like having someone probe my life and body during an exam.
0.571400	Usually it's just dealing with the doctor and potentially telling them that they're wrong if they were to simply give me medicine with a thousand sides effects that hide the real problem one might have.

0.285700	I'm not really usually very worried when visiting a doctor's office.

Additionally, when I have blood tests I sometimes fear that they may discover something that is wrong that could be caused by cancer or some other major illness.
0.428600	I am always worried that I will not get a good bill of health.  I have some weight to lose and know that I might be confronted about that and what I should be doing.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I take any of the bad news to come with stride and try and have a positive outlook whenever I visit the doctors office. I do not fear checkups or any examinations.
0.690500	Mainly worried they will be giving me bad news. A lot of bad diseases, cancer, heart conditions, etc, are in my family. 
0.357100	I can't explain it.  I just don't particularly enjoy then environment and I have a low level uncomfortable feeling about it all.
0.285700	Well, this doesn't really apply; see, I go to the doctor when something is bothering me or once a year for my checkup. The doctor is there to help me, is my attitude, so even if I'm worried about some condition, I don't fear going and doN't feel very anxious or worried.
0.833300	I get scared because I worry about what might be wrong. I get all worked up about it. I'm worried about having to take a new medication or if there might be something seriously wrong with me. It really freaks me out.

There is anxiety and worry when visiting a doctor's office because the doctor might not be able to help you, they may not give a lot of time for your visit and rush to see another patient when you still feel unsure about how to proceed. The doctor might not have confidence in treating you and that is also scary.
0.142900	The most frustrating occurrence is the never-ending rotation of doctors.  It seems every year, (interns) I have to go through my entire history again.  Including, family, life, medical, etc.  Then, a new diagnosis, new medications, and so on, and so on.

0.357100	Whenever i feel anxious seeing my doctor its generally due to me not knowing how much information or what information specifically i should release to her even though im fully aware i should tell her everything due to HIPA and the confidnetiality it provides. I still have anxiety however with certain things like mental state etc. 
0.666700	What makes me feel anxious is being diagnosed with an incurable illness such as Cancer or MS. Also, if they are not able to diagnose what's going on with me
0.523800	While logically I know that there's likely nothing wrong with me, the last visit I had involved being diagnosed with PTSD. It was a bit of a soul-crusher to have had that confirmed, because I sort of knew that I did for the month leading up to the visit.
0.214300	That what I think is no big deal will turn out to be something a lot more serious. I also get anxious if I have to get a shot as I am not a fan of needles. I also get a little anxious being exposed to sick people.
0.642900	I feel anxious that they are going to find something and give me bad news. No one wants bad news in their life. I know I could make better judgement as far as health goes and I am always worried that what I am doing is not enough. Especially when I was pregnant I was always afraid something would go wrong. 
0.309500	I am mainly anxious when i visit a dr because I am afraid I am going to have bad news leaving. I am terrified that I am going to be diagnosed with an illness I will not be able to treat or get proper treatment for.
0.714300	Generally what makes me feel most anxious is when I know I have something wrong but I can not match an illness to the symptoms. 
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's. I have enough experience with doctors that I am comfortable that I can ask for and get what I need.
0.238100	I worry when there is a waiting time before diagnosis. I have had 3 or 4 good scares in my life, liver failure and cancer. I am not the kind of person that will freak out on possibly fatal news like that.  The other thing was needles. I used to become quite anxious when waiting. 
0.881000	I often feel like they will rush me and not listen to what I have to say or that they will write me off as a hypochondriac.
0.595200	Mainly because I have awful anxiety, I worry about everything so it's in my nature to worry about a million different things.  Also, I've been battling against my weight for a while.  I just never know if my doctor is going to be proud of my progress that I've made since I've last visited or if he's going to be disappointed that I'm not losing weight faster.
0.404800	I am not too anxious when going to my doctor, that is, about the physical exam. I do have social anxiety, so for the most part I am nervous around all people and social situations. So sometimes talking one on one and being physically examined makes me anxious, but it's not the doctor's fault.
0.761900	When I go for my yearly exam and it involves female stuff I hate it. It is uncomfortable for the patient and for the Doctor. Plus it is somewhat painful. Then there is the breast exam. I don't like anyone seeing me undressed much less touching me in a private area. I am always so relieved when it is over and I am walking out all dressed!
0.142900	i would say the wait to see if you are ok like your blood work your blood pressure your ox your heart your weight
0.714300	Sometimes I worry that something may be seriously wrong with me, in which case I would rather not know. But it makes me anxious not knowing, so I have to know if anything might be wrong with me.
0.547600	It depends on what has been going on with me lately. I know when I haven't been trying to take care of myself in terms of diet and exercise and fear what the doctor will say about the results of some of those little examinations. If I also have some kind of sickness I've never dealt with before, I can start to feel fairly anxious. 
0.452400	I feel anxious about the probable poking and prodding that will take place, and the inevitable disdain that the doctor will evoke once I start making suggestions that might contradict something they had stated. I also worry about the possible copay. 
0.738100	I am always more worried before a procedure.  A checkup doesn't really bother me, but if I have to have surgery or blood taken or something like that, then I become very anxious.  I worry about what will happen during and after the procedure and how I will feel.
0.381000	I'm afraid that they aren't going to really listen to what I have to say.  I am afraid that they will give me a generic answer to my problems instead of asking me more questions just to make sure it isn't a more serious problem.
1.000000	I fear that I will be sick and that insurance will not cover it. I feel that the offices make me sick. I also think the doctor wants to get me in trouble with the insurance company so I lose my plan.
0.833300	Worried that he will deliver bad news. I am at the dr to make sure everything is ok, but i worry about the discovery of something negative. 
0.666700	At age 72, and having a number of health issues, I accept the fact that time is running out for me.  I always feel tense with each medical exam as the likelihood of the onset of a potentially lethal condition would not be surprising at my age.
0.666700	I have social anxiety, everyone makes me anxious. But being in a place that knows you are having difficulties makes it worse. Nurses, PA's, Doc's all rushing around coming in and going out.
0.547600	I worry I will be scolded for having poor self-care. I worry that they will find out I am actually quite sick. Also, I am generally nervous around many people who are authorities and I have a strong desire to look as though I know a lot, but I don't actually know much about the medical field.
0.833300	Just listening to what my Doctor is telling me about my impairments. There is usually never any improvement and no signs of possible or potential improvement. It is essentially my Doctor telling me that I will probably have these issues for the remainder of my life. 
0.547600	That the doctor will detect something that could be life threatening at the least. Even if it not life threatening if I was told that I would have to radically alter my life style such as activities or diet I would find it as a great disruption. At least at first.
0.309500	Always makes me nervous to see a doctor, although my health is quite good.  Probably left over from child hood when I would have to go because of something stupid I did.
1.000000	"Even though I have a ""good"" insurance plan, I am in constant fear that something unaffordable will happen at the doctor's office. If the doctor decides to send me to a lab, imaging center, or hospital, it might be out of network or there might be some other loophole that will give my insurance company an excuse not to pay. A prescription might be on some arbitrary list causing my insurance to deny it. Even the doctors fees might be mishandled by the insurance company. There is no way to comparison shop or get an estimate of fees beforehand. As a patient I am at the mercy of a healthcare system rapaciously seeking to squeeze every possible dollar of profit out of me."
0.285700	I am just generally anxious about what he will find or that he will discover I have been doing something wrong. I am not worried about his actions or thoughts but, my own and chance happenings.
0.809500	I am always worried about my weight and if the doctor is going to say something about it. I don't like talking about my weight. 
0.428600	What makes me the most worried when i visit the doctor's office is the possibility of having negative results. Knowing that i take care of myself and am in good health, i should not as much but still. Things manifest in healthy people all the time.
0.285700	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am most worried when I discover a reason for which I will need to see a doctor
0.238100	Waiting. Once I am back in the exam room I'm usually ok. The only other thing was expressing how bad I felt knowing it was something other than the flu or general fatigue and worry about not being able to express it because I am such a strong person that doesn't show weakness so its hard for me to really break down and let people know I feel horrible.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor's office.  I guess I hope they don't tell me I have cancer or something.
0.404800	I have an eating disorder, and if a doctor or nurse is new to me, I sometimes worry I'll get unwanted and unhelpful advice about diet and exercise. I don't like looking at the scale, either, for related reasons. 
0.642900	i always feel like i'm going in for a test I didn't study for. I usually have a list of questions i want to ask and in my nervousness i forget them all. 
0.285700	The only time I feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I know that the only solution to fixing the problem is surgery. 
0.619000	When I'm going in for something and I'm not sure what is wrong with me, there is always uncertainty there with not knowing what could potentially be wrong with me. 
0.261900	I get anxious going to the doctor's office mainly because of any uncertainty as to what is wrong, plus the doctor's office itself makes me anxious, just the smell.
0.666700	The overall institutional feel makes me feel uncomfortable. I also do not like sitting by myself in a quiet room for thirty minutes before the doctor comes in, giving me ample time to worry though every possible thing they could say. 
0.214300	The thing that probably makes me feel the most anxious is when my doctor finds something potentially wrong that I didn't know about, especially if it could potentially be a really big deal.  At one point he was worried about a mole I had on my skin being potential melanoma so he removed it and had it tested.  The test came back negative, but the roughly 1 week it took to get the results was nerve-wracking.  
0.333300	I only worry about cancer, since it seems to be the hidden disease that pops up on people sometimes without warning.  This is about the only thing that worries me that one day it will show up on some sort of test.  
0.571400	I feel the most anxious when I have symptoms that I haven't been able to cure on my own and that's what's bringing me to the doctor's office in the first place. 
0.500000	I can feel anxious regarding when I have to wait for a test result as if its something that could mean there could be adverse results for long term.
0.452400	There are a few things that could make you feel anxious when visiting a doctor's office.  A couple things that make me anxious or worried is how much the copay is going to be and if I paid my  Deductible yet or in my going to get charged a ton of money.  The next thing I worry about is sitting in the waiting room with all the sick people.   Another thing that makes me anxious on the way to The Doctor's office is how long the wait is going to be in the waiting room.  Also if your blood pressure is going to be high when you 1st get there because all the waiting.
0.452400	What makes me feel anxious is not knowing rather I did good of bad when it comes time to check my diabetes and what the results will show.  I dont follow what i am supposed to be doing on a regular basis so everytime i usually get anxious about it and what my doctor will think. Also when going to the doctor sick people are in there and i dont want to catch what they have like strep, cold or even worse this years Flu. 
0.833300	I feel anxious and worried when i will have to visit Doctor as I am afraid if any other deseases may come to my notice apart from the one for which i wished to consult doctor and also if the doctor confirms my ailment as the one which cant be treated or there is no treatment that leads to frighten me.
0.261900	The fact that they can get very intimate into my personal life, both physically and emotionally.  They also can sometimes be slightly vague with what their thinking is on my health.
0.333300	I'm always worried about finding out that something is wrong with me that I didn't know. There's always a fear that I may go to the doctor for something routine and find out something catostrophic
0.261900	I hate getting on the scale. I never want to know how much I weigh, and I always tell the nurse not to tell me. That's probably not a great idea. My blood pressure is almost always good, but I get nervous that perhaps on a particular visit, it will be high. 
0.714300	I believe it is all pyschological because most of the time when you go to the doctor something is wrong. So then when you go for a regular visit those same feelings come back. The ones you had when you were sick, injured or didn't even know what was wrong  in the first place. Some of the uncertainty is also worrying about my loved ones if something was in fact wrong with me. What also contributes to the uncertainty is not understanding medical terminology and if whether or not what you are being told is actually correct.
0.547600	i get worried about finding out something about my health that totally blindsides me, or that ended up in a poor state due to lack of action on my part.
0.714300	I am very uncomfortable when going to any doctor. I don't like people touching me and going to the doctor it is usually a given that there is going to be someone touching me. 
0.285700	Anything involving needles. I have a HUGE needle phobia that has oftentimes prevented me from getting typical blood work or vaccines.
0.571400	"What asinine charges are they going to bring up? Am I going to be charged because they used a gauze pad to cover a wound (should I have brought my own)? Are they going to find cause to put me through the most useless, expensive tests, because they ""feel"" there is some issue worth investigating? Are they even going to bother prescribing the correct medicines, or has some drug company paid them an exorbitant fee to prescribe their medicine above all others, even when that medication is unnecessary/not fit for the condition/better options are available?"
0.595200	I do not enjoy waiting to be seen and all the little things that must be done (weight, temperature, blood pressure). 
0.976200	Something about the look of doctor's offices, I also don't like them to touch me. I am afraid of pain. I was upset and scared last time I was in the hospital. 
0.309500	I don't usually have fear when visiting the doctor. I only get anxious if I have to get a shot. Those occasions are few and far between.
0.285700	I am usually nervous and anxious during my doctor's appointment. My blood pressure is almost always higher when it is being measured by the nurse. I guess I want to unconsciously be as healthy as possible and can sense judgement of some sort - or maybe it is all in my head.
0.571400	Getting injections of any kind. As well as x-rays and cat-scans. talking about cancers of any kind. i dont like how many germs and other possible parasites are  around the inside of docters office.
0.690500	Worried that they will find something wrong that would require expensive treatments or hinder my standard of living that would put a burden on my family and friends
0.142900	I do not worry when I go to the doctor's.  I know it is necessary for my health.  I have confidence that my doctor will listen to my complaints and proscribe the necessary and correct treatments.
0.500000	Uncertainty about potentially bad things.  Moles that could be cancer, things of that nature.  When I don't understand or know what is going on with my own body, that brings anxiety.
0.285700	It depends what i am going in for. i think that if i am already unsure about something regarding my health, the unease will already be there.
0.142900	I am currently diagnosed with a chronic condition.  The thing that makes me the most anxious or worried is finding out that my health has gotten worse rather than stayed stable.
0.404800	I've come from a history of cancer in my mothers side of my family. I would feel worried of anxious if they would diagnosis with something in that range. I have small children so I feel that I have to be here to guide them in to their adulthood.
0.809500	I'm not sure what I get so anxious or worried about, I just hate doctors offices. From the time I walk in (even if it's just to get a vaccine), my blood pressure elevates. I think that it stems from a time when I had a life threatening condition but I didn't know and went into the appointment thinking it was something simple, but instead I was rushed to the emergency room and spent several days in the hospital. 
0.333300	for example, a pain that I have never felt in my body, the delivery of blood tests, that the doctor who regularly treats me does not treat me, I find out that something is not right with my body.
0.333300	I ALWAYS FEEL A LITTLE ANXIOUS AND WORRIED BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT HE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG.
0.666700	I dont like going to the doctor if I can avoid it. It makes me think maybe something is wrong. I would rather be finished and find out what is the diagnosis
0.809500	Whenever I'm in a doctor's office, hospital, or clinic setting, I just have an uneasy feeling in general.  Doctor's offices and hospitals make me nervous as I associate them with health problems and pain.  I often feel worried when waiting for results as I'm nervous to see if they have good or bad news for me regarding my health.  I usually rely on a doctor's demeanor or personality to help comfort and relax me in these types of situations.
0.452400	I have had poor past experiences with doctors that automatically makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, even though I trust my current doctor. Just being in a doctor's office setting seems to trigger the anxiety.
0.547600	I worry that I will find out there's something wrong that's more significant than I expected.  I also have had several illnesses where it took doctors a while to figure out what the problem was.  So, sometimes I worry that I won't get an answer/resolution/treatment plan.
0.619000	When visiting the doctors office, I am nervous about seeing my doctor because of the poor relationship we have, as well as what he might tell my mother. Im not a fan of needles either, so when getting a shot it freaks me out. The anxiety lasts for about half of the visit, once I realize that im going to be ok i level out and calm down. I should realize this before I even get into the doctors office, but it still freaks me out. Maybe thats something Ill work on.
0.785700	Having someone who I do not see often look me over concerns me. I get anxious when they check my heart rate and such which probably contributes to my heart rate going up. They sometimes try to talk while checking my heart rate which makes me more anxious as I have to participate in a conversation.
0.738100	I have social anxiety so i have difficulty communicating at times. Having someone ask me personal questions or see me in a vulnerable position can make me feel uneasy. 
0.738100	My genetics/family health history is not great so I'm always a bit worried something's going to hit me out of nowhere as I get older.
1.000000	I often worry that they will find something seriously wrong with me or that I am going to die.  Even though I feel ok, I always dread that they might find something that canât be cured or they canât help to heal.
0.619000	I am always worried something else will be wrong with me than just what I am going in for...or that whatever I have is worse than what I think. Additionally, I am always worried about remembering the things I want to ask, and if I will have enough time to ask the questions I have. So it makes me really anxious and worried. 
0.714300	I worry about some of the tests that are done, such as taking blood and maybe they would have to give me a shot.
0.476200	I just always wonder if I'm in worse shape than most others seen by the doctors.  It makes me evaluate the uncomfortable aspects of my health and my body.
0.357100	It is simply that factor of uncertainty. Even if you feel healthy you can never truly know if there is something wrong that can't be seen or felt. You always want to hear that you are healthy but you can't know if they are going to find something unusual.
0.214300	I sometimes just feel generally anxious when I visit the doctor's office - I feel that I suffer from 'white coat phenomena'. I sometimes notice that my blood pressure is elevated for no particular reason when I visit the doctor's office.
0.309500	The unknown makes me anxious and worried.  Not knowing what to expect or what the doctor will say in regards to an issue I've had.  I spend too much time researching online about various illnesses and going to see a doctor about it makes me very anxious.  No one wants to be given bad news so, not knowing exactly what will be said is very nerve-racking.
0.357100	When i go to the doctors office my main worry is whether or not im going to be getting a shot. I do not like needles and really hate getting a shot or giving blood. 
0.190500	Honestly the cost thereâs not much else other than that like I feel like going to a doctor making sure Iâm OK doing my research hoping they do their research but if they make mistakes that cost more money that is what frustrates the worries 
0.714300	sitting in a waiting room full of potential sick people. that he might charge me a unreasonably high amount etc,
0.476200	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is that he will tell me that I have a major illness or condition that will make it impossible to live my life the way I want to.
0.642900	I come from a family with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, and I'm always anxious when I go to the doctor that they'll find out I have one of these things.
1.000000	Once I am waiting over 20min I start to panic severely because the wait alone is bad - it is exhausting, then you kind of lose your momentum and forget to tell the doctor things which makes me more anxious - then I am fearful once I tell her my symptoms that she will tell me 5 different BAD deadly things that it could be and she wants to run a bunch of blood work and tests which then make me have panic attacks until the test day and then weeks until the results are in - the waiting for everything is the most difficult
0.881000	To hear any bad news like things are getting worse or that they don't have any other medicines/options to help my symptoms.
0.666700	I think it's just the stress of being there and seeing 5 different people including the doctor, who all do different things and can't answer my questions or come and go too fast for me to ask
0.333300	I feel anxious or worried because you never know what is going to come out of that visit. For one, I battle with high blood pressure. And at times my pressure would be elevated and others not. So when I go and see my doctor it always concerns me because one day Iâm taking pills and the next day I am not. Itâs nerve wracking even though I am considered healthly based off my physical exams.
0.238100	I do not feel worried when I go to the doctor.  I believe in a simple and necessary procedure that does not require any additional alarm.
0.142900	That the doctor will find something in a scan or in blood work that would lead me to making life or death decisions. I don't think I would be able to handle that right now in this day in age with everything else that is going on . 
0.785700	Needles, blood and going to the doctors really stress me out. I can withstand pain, but seeing blood and needle scare me a lot. The thought of the needle piercing through my skin and drawing my blood out. I had a complete check out at one time long ago to determine the cause of my vertigo. My primary care doctor sent me to this lab. They took 4 tubes of blood from me. The worse part, they told me not to eat anything prior to the blood drawn. I almost faint. I was dizzy, and feel like vomiting. The nurse me to laid down and rest afterward. It was so crazy. 
0.690500	I think it may be the atmosphere or the ambiance of the doctors office. Its too quiet and smells like disinfectant. Iâm always feeling a little anxious and nervous when I have an appointment even when itâs just a check up/physical. I donât know... Iâve never thought about why it is that I get nervous when I go to the doctors.
0.666700	I do not like the smell of the waiting room because it smells like the alcohol wipes. I also do not like waiting when I am just going for a checkup and I have to be around all the other sick people. I also just do not like shots and that makes me the most anxious.
0.714300	The biggest fear when going to the doctor is that something seriously wrong might be discovered. In fact, I have health anxiety, and the fear that a small normal sensation is cancer or some other disease is quite scary. That is what makes me nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.928600	I am self conscious about my body, so I don't particularly like having to undress or show certain parts of my body. I don't like to be touched and I am also sometimes concerned with what my diagnoses could be or other things unrelated to the reason I am there that the doctor might find. 
0.642900	Just the overall atmosphere tends to get to me. It's never set well with me, and I doubt that it ever will.
0.238100	Because the only one that knows everything is God. For that reason I fell very anxious because no matter I'm healthy and fit and try to be doing the right thing you never know when your luck or the destiny is on you're side because when is you're time is you're time.
0.595200	"I think what makes me feel the most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me but my gut is telling me that I know more about what is actually wrong than what my doctor knows.  Sometimes I wish instead of just treating a million different symptoms, they'd just treat the cause or say ""Look honestly, I don't know what's wrong"".  "
0.857100	Just the thought that they might find something wrong or give me bad news about something.  Just going to the dr in general makes me a little nervous.
0.595200	I am afraid i'm going to get yelled at for something I have or have not done to take care of myself.
0.381000	I am always a little bit anxious that the doctor may have some bad news for me. It is also not very fun to be poked and prodded and I have a fear of needles. 
0.714300	I feel anxious because of potentially being told some bad news. I also feel anxious at potentially having more of my time wasted by the purposefully inefficient system they have.
0.381000	I'm not a worrier and I'm not overly anxious but I think anytime I go to the doctor it's for very good reason - certainly not just a cold. So when I arrive, I am expecting something somewhat serious. Not cancer or some terminal diagnosis but something requiring treatment. 
0.571400	Just the unknown. I tend to be a bit of a worry-wart, so knowing everything will be ok and that I don't have X, Y or Z is always a relief. As I ge older, I realize the difference between being vigilent and attentive to one's own health and being a bit paranoid.
0.642900	I'm afraid they or going to find something wrong with me. This brings me emotional and financial uncertainty. I am also afraid they will treat me,but something will go wrong which can harm me further.
0.642900	Nothing foreal just wondering if something is really wrong with you.aBut u have to find out.Because it might be to late
0.309500	I feel most anxious if I need to have test done and need to wait for the results. I feel most worried if I am called in for a follow up appointment that I was not expecting.
0.333300	I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorder so it is something I struggle with in my day to day life.  However, going to the doctor sometimes causes my anxiety to increase just because I feel shy and awkward in the situation. 
0.452400	Receiving bad news about my health. Overall, I'm healthy but something could pop up. Or if I go in for a certain reason and they can't provide good news about the condition. 
0.690500	That something will be wrong, that a slight twinge or pain I've had for a long time will turn out to be something terminal. And even though I've tried to be healthier, and do right by my life, and improve...that it all will be meaningless because I suddenly have some horrible disease (cancer, illness, etc.) that will cut my life short before I can get it back on track.
0.357100	I am overweight, so it just makes me anxious to have to weigh-in and discuss my weight with my doctor. It also makes me uneasy when I have to do things like pull up my shirt to have my stomach checked. 
0.571400	Sometimes I had white coat syndrome. This is when I went to the doctor's office my blood pressure would be fine and then she would take my blood pressure and it would be elevated.
0.738100	I am most worried about my doctor personally attacking me for my choices I have made. It is hard telling how he will act. 
0.642900	First off, I am generally an anxious person, so that doesn't help.  Mostly for me, it relates to the fact that I am going because something is generally wrong, or I am looking for medical advice.  When I either know or suspect that something is wrong, but I do not know what, it easily makes me anxious.  Combine that with the fact that I always have some sort of idea how the visit will go, but having the visit never go that way, I get easily anxious about the visit.
0.428600	I dont like when people touch me.. and even though i know him, i dont know him on a personal level like that. plus the germs at the doctor really bother me. 
0.333300	I generally do not feel too anxious when I visit a doctor. The only anxiety I feel, is if the problem is worse that I had imagined. But overall I do not feel worried. 
0.857100	I don't want to be given things I am allergic to, and I want to feel better. Doctors don't always give me that feeling that I will feel better.
0.309500	I am also worried and anxious that something is going to be wrong with me.  I'm just afraid for the worst care scenario.
0.857100	You never know what they are going to find. Maybe they find something bad that always makes me very nervous.
0.381000	I am anxious or worried when I google symptoms myself and work myself up over what could be. I get worried that I may be sick with something contagious, especially when I am busy at work, because I often have to be at work to get certain things done. I also do not like being contagious because I worry I will get other members of my family sick.
0.238100	The unknown answer of what might be the issue. Unless Army doctors- then its the worry of laziness causing further harm. 
0.809500	I always feel like I'm getting in trouble when I go to the doctor.  I see them as an authority figure and having to discuss any issue in detail causes me great anxiety.  I feel that they will blame me for whatever health issue is going on.  I don't feel they will be open to discussing other options or side effects of medications they prescribe.  I often feel dismissed if I want to try alternative natural options.  They treat me like I'm inferior and they know best.  I hate having to feel like I need to fight for my own health issues, instead of just do what is convenient for them.
0.214300	It's more just a general worry of could anything be wrong or irrational things like even though I'm on birth control is it possible I'm pregnant random things like that. Not so much an actual I am worried because of my doctor or any real possibility.
0.690500	Finding out what is actually wrong with me. And just having to tell them all my business. I'm not the most social person.
0.881000	If ever I am at a doctor's office, it is normally because I am experienced an unexplained medical issue. I am always worried about what could be wrong. I am a worst case scenario type of person. I always assume the worst and come prepared to hear the worst, whether that is true or not. I also get worried that I will leave the office without many answers as to what is going on. I typically have great blood pressure, but as soon as they take it at the doctors office, it is always much higher due to my nerves!
0.666700	I always feel like the doctor is going to look at me weird or find something that is wrong that I wasn't aware of.  
1.000000	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel anxious or worried about not being given a choice about anything that may be wrong. I also feel anxious about being poked and prodded as well as being told I need a needle to make me feel better instead of treating a problem, the doctor treats the symptoms.
0.357100	"The thing that makes me most anxious is when I do not believe my concerns are being addressed. For instance, a doctor did not want to discuss my ankle problem during a ""well woman examination,"" and gave me a lecture about this. She said I'd need another appointment. I wanted to ask one or two quesions before I agreed to do that and she cut me off. The ankle pain was having a significant effect on my quality of life."
0.642900	There is an element of wanting to stay healthy and be on track.  Thoughts might go to the measures you've taken such as exercise and diet to stay healthy.  Have these been adequate or is more required, and will you now be able to accomplish what will be asked of you?
0.404800	I'm most worried that they will find something very seriously wrong that I had no idea was going on with my body.  There are many stories of people finding out they have cancer or other diseases when it's too late, and they never had symptoms.
0.809500	I am most worried about the wait being too long. It would be great if they used a ticket system so we do not have to wait, crowded in an area where there might be germs left by sick people.
0.857100	I'm worried that they'll find something really wrong with me or that they'll say that I'm worse off than I think I am.  I'm also not a big fan of needles, and actively try to avoid getting stuck with one.
0.881000	It's always the fear and anxiety over wondering what's wrong with me. Do I want to know? No, but I have to. It's the anxiety of wondering if it's something serious. It's the anxiety of possibly receiving bad news. It's the anxiety of worrying about possibly having surgery. It's the anxiety of being surrounded by sick people in the waiting room. All of that combined makes me very anxious when I visit the doctor. And most of all, it's simply the anxiety of getting bad news that worries me the most.
0.142900	Can't say as I'm usually worried when visiting the doctor's office.  So, nothing? I pretty much know why I'm there and what the ultimate result/plan is going to be.
0.738100	Generally do not know exactly what is going to be done.  The rush of an appointment is so out of proportion to home much of your day had to be arranged to be there.
0.714300	It is mainly the fear of not getting any answers to my questions.  This as well as having my body examined by a somewhat creepy doctor who seems interested in me.
0.142900	I am usually not worried...just the awkwardness of say, a pelvic exam, or being in one of those glamorous paper gowns. I am not anxious about my health since I am only there for routine checkups.
0.666700	I sometimes fear the doctor will provide me with bad news about my health, or no news  at all. Either way, I do not wish to pay large medical bills for these types of outcomes.
0.285700	I feel anxious about a potential upsetting diagnosis at times especially when a concern could be a symptom of a serious ailment like cancer
0.881000	I feel anxious about what the problem may be, what the treatment options would be, and any recovery time. I worry about my blood pressure, heart rate, and weight, even though I've never had problem with any of those three. The thing that makes me most nervous is trying to explain to the doctor my illness or pain. I always feel like I'm being judged and I can't explain myself well enough.
0.714300	I am always nervous around doctors because If I am at the doctor it is because something is wrong with my health that I have not been able to address by myself. That being said, I also am just nervous around unfamiliar people in general, and as a young and fairly healthy person, all doctors are unfamiliar. 
0.476200	I need to lose about 40 pounds, and I need to eat better.  I always have plans to do that but never get it done.  
0.547600	I worry a little about my blood pressure because it runs high in my family but then I also know that if you worry about it, it will raise the pressure. So there is a bit of a feedback loop that goes on where I worry that I am worrying and it will then raise my BP. I also get a little nervous when they do the cancer checks. I know that its very unlikely because I am young and healthy but I had several family members that died of cancer growing up and seeing them deal with that disease is very scary and I really hope that I go a different way. 
0.714300	Sometimes not knowing what might happen. What if something is abnormal and It turns out to be something bad.
0.142900	I feel no worries or nerves when I walk into the office, because I know she will take good care of me. She has never let me down, and knows exactly how to cure me and knows what she needs to do in order to get me to feel better. 
0.142900	My biggest worries at the doctor's office are things like my weight an blood pressure.  Doctors very rarely give me any reason to feel anxious about their care.  I do not enjoy routine blood work or shots.
0.476200	I'm always worried that the doctor will be disappointed that weight isn't where it should be. I worry about the blood test results. It's part of the unknown that worries me. 
0.452400	The thing that makes me the most anxious when visiting the doctors office is worrying that I won't be taken seriously and won't get the help I need.  I feel like that happens a lot.  Also, I don't like when I have to get undressed and put on one of those hospital gowns for an exam.  I don't think anyone does.  The worst part is when I have to get a pap smear.  The speculum and the actual procedure is pretty painful too.  Another thing that makes me nervous is fear that I'm going to look stupid when I don't understand something exactly.  Also, if the doctor orders tests, that can be no fun although I know it's necessary.
0.642900	If I have a particular symptom that could require major intervention, such as surgery, I become worried. Pain, particularly orthopedic pain, can often mean a chronic problem has developed wherein I will need surgery or will have to stop an activity. This makes me anxious. 
0.285700	When a doctor is condescending or makes you feel like you have done something wrong. It takes quite a bit to make me feel anxious and that will do it. I would only be worried about a specific diagnoses and I don't think that a doctor could control that.
0.833300	I'm not a big fan of being touched by people I don't know, even if it's by a medical professional looking for 'lumps' or what have you. I guess that makes me feel uneasy, but I also worry that one day I'll receive a negative medical diagnosis. 
0.333300	If I go in for something embarrassing and/or unpleasant. If I happen to have waited a little to long before I went to the Dr because I thought the problem would go away and didn't want to hear any bad news. 
0.904800	I always fear the worst, that something is really wrong with me. plus, I worry I'll be able to get all I need out of the appointment. 
0.642900	What makes me the most anxious and worried is that they do not do a thorough examination.  They move patients through like they are cattle and it's frustrating. People deserve a hundred percent of the  doctors attention for a complete physical that should really include blood work after a certain age. I'm worried that the doctors are working so quickly that they will miss something serious and by the time it's caught it will be too late and I'll end up dying from something that could have been fixed had it been caught in a timely manner. It scared me to think that could happen to me. 
0.452400	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong that I didn't notice.  Or that they will make negative comments about my life choices or lifestyle. 
0.333300	I am always anxious that anything I have that is bothering me will turn out to be something serious and untreatable. I always worry that I have cancer or will develop it at some point, because both my parents died of cancer. Although all my doctor visits are basically well visits, I still worry he will find something serious.
0.738100	I just don't like the process and while I'm not a full blown hypochondriac, my mother was and I just worry about if something will be wrong with me, even though I don't spend most of my daily life worrying about random sicknesses.
0.642900	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office if I'm really sick. I feel this way because I wonder if something is seriously wrong with me. I think there may be other things wrong with me that the doctor may find that I didn't know about before. I wonder if there is something wrong with me that the doctor will not be able to cure or fix easily. I also think about how healthy I am in general compared to other people.
0.381000	I do not get anxious or worried about the actual examination or medical procedure itself, but more from a general misunderstanding of what is going on. I feel that I have no idea how much everything is going to cost and if I am even visiting the right doctor for the issue. If I am sick or have a medical issue, I don't know who to go to and do not understand how my health insurance policy works. 
0.523800	I am most anxious about the discovery of an underlying or latent condition that is not showing symptoms. I feel relatively fine and try to stay in good health but you never know what may come back in your blood work or what the doctor may find during an examination. 
0.142900	THE ONLY TIME I FEEL ANXIOUS OR NERVOUS WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTORS IS IF THEY THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG OR I AM SICK AND THINK I MIGHT BE NERVOUS OF THE OUTCOME.
0.452400	That I am not going to receive the proper care and relief to my issues. That he is going to make a mistake due to laziness or make a wrong decision due to his comfort level
0.714300	Feeling like a doctor missed something or I didn't speak up enough. That, and finding out something else that is just really awful.
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I only got bored if I need to wait too long.
0.142900	Sometimes I fear getting vaccinations. I only fear them because I never expect it so it takes me by surprise. Plus I have a low pain tolerance so that lays a huge role.
0.857100	I never know if I'm going to get bad news. I've lost a lot of family members due to several different illnesses (walking pnuemonia, breast cancer, liver disease, etc.) so I'm always on edge that I could be next. 
0.904800	I feel anxious overall. I would be anxious over the wait time in the lobby and not knowing what to expect at the appointment.
0.523800	Just knowing that I have to have Lab work done and hoping the results are going to be where they should be.
0.452400	I feel worried that they will find something, mainly cancer, that I have not noticed going on with my body. I worry that they will tell me that I am not healthy for my age. I worry that they will tell me that I need to make changes in my lifestyle. 
0.523800	"I always wonder what my diagnosis will be; I am a worrier and always ""WebMD"" things and blow things out of proportion. I look forward to meeting with my doctor because she helps to put things into perspective for me."
0.547600	Just going to a doctors office makes me a little anxious. I have some anxiety issues so when doing something or going somewhere new I get nervous. I would also be a little worried that any issues I have would be passed off as just anxiety symptoms.
0.476200	Concern about what they may find and what they may have to say about my weight! :-) Other than that, I find it an enjoyable experience. 
0.357100	At times I feel worried about getting the results of my blood work. I feel relieved once I find out that there is nothing abnormal and I am in good health. 
0.547600	There is always the opportunity of hearing bad news.  The memory of hearing bad news in the past about my own health, or a loved one's health.  The idea that an appointment could lead to a scary or painful procedure.  Also, the possibility of financial loss.
0.666700	In general I get stressed when going to a doctor. There is no certain reason why I get that way but I do. I think it may go back to my childhood going to doctors worrying about getting shots, etc.
0.238100	I don't really stress much because I know my body.  I have a slight degree about the worry that something else might appear. but all in all I trust my doctor.
0.714300	I am a bit (at least) out of shape and I have concerns that visiting will cause me to work on too many things that I know I should.  Lame, I know but I can live with it alright for now.
0.285700	how much time it will take, I don't like to wait.  other than waiting I don't mind going to the doctor's office.
0.714300	"A general health care facility doesn't always understand that some people are intelligent and they don't like when a patient says ""I don't want that"". "
0.476200	I am afraid that something may be wrong.  Or if something is already wrong, that it may not be easily resolved. 
0.190500	If that when I do go in for something minor he has to have a sit down with me in order to mention something serious.
0.642900	I always feel anxious or worried when visiting, just because if there is bad news to be given, that is where it is going to come from.  I am not the healthiest person ever, and I know that one day that could all backfire on me.
0.666700	I am a cancer patient. I am approaching my 60th birthday, and I am beginning to experience health concerns that are related to my age. It causes me anxiety to learn about changing health parameters, such as blood pressure, that are more difficult for me to cope with due to my increasing age.
0.404800	The uncertainty is what makes me the most worried.  I am actually eager to get back the results as soon as possible so I could see what the issue is but waiting for it is what worries me the most.
0.357100	I DON'T OFTEN VISIT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE FOR MYSELF.  WHEN I DO GO TO A DOCTOR IT IS BECAUSE I AM EXPERIENCING AN ACUTE ILLNESS THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY WITH SELF CARE SUCH AS THE FLU.  I FEEL ANXIOUS BECAUSE I KNOW THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IS WRONG AND MUST USUALLY BE GUIDED INTO CONCLUSIONS.
0.142900	I sometimes feel anxious prior to arriving to the doctors office because of the unknown result. I believe that my condition can change from time to time and this causes a little worry. I trust my doctor's knowledge of medicine, his ability to diagnose conditions, and treated appropriately.
0.595200	Visiting the doctors office will always make me anxious due to the reason of the visit, or the idea that maybe the results of an analysis of blood work or urine sample is positive. Also getting an injection or the idea of getting an operation is frightening to me. The feeling is competently normal. Even if you are just doing a routine check up . The doctor can have a lot of patients to see before you ,and the idea of waiting in line for 30 min can make me anxious. You always assume the worst even if you have a mild cold or headache. With the flu season you always feel like you are the next person to have gotten it . Or when you get a mild rash from eating something with  citrus in it. Other than that I'm very happy after seeing my physician . It is calming  to know that everything is ok.
0.142900	"Not much.  I don't like giving blood samples, so that would be the biggest ""fear"" or cause for anxiety.  The other one is the prostate exam."
0.523800	the possibility of the doctor discovering something i was unaware. while it's good they are able to identify anything which needs to be addressed, i'm obviously hoping that i leave the doctor with a clean bill of health. i'm always worried that this will not be the case. 
0.309500	Just that they might find something wrong with me.  Like a mole that is too big or some lump I did not notice.  Nothing major just the general anxiety that comes with going to the doctor.  You never know when something that you think is small or did not even notice could turn into something big.  You hear about it all of the time.
0.381000	Most of the time I worried that I might forget stuff that I need to tell him in order to help me with my condition.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor because I know everything will be okay with my doctors care.
0.238100	Being unsure as to what the doctor may tell me concerning my health. Going to the doctor does not always go the way I would like it to. I do not always get the best results. Doctors do find issues that have to be resolved.
1.000000	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried in a doctor's office would be the fact that they will be giving me news on something I don't wanna hear or they are telling me I'm going to have to give labs and give blood.
0.690500	The anxiety I believe comes from the uncertainty of what I might be told. Although I could leave the office with a clean bill of health there is always the chance you could find out you have a serious medical issue.
0.357100	Probably the possibility of outcomes. I'm always nervous that the problems I'm there for will be something more serious. 
0.761900	I am always worried that the doctors will not listen to my concerns and take them seriously. Most doctors I have seen just wanted to give me medicines without actually trying to find the cause of the sickness itself. I am always worried when I see doctors now that they will not listen fully to my concerns. 
0.571400	The entire time. I don't just go for anything, but when I do it is usually serious. They have a tendency to treat people like cattle, and that makes it all the worse for an anxious person.
0.309500	"I don't typically go to the doctor for checkups, I only go when there is an issue. So I am always a little hesitant and worried something serious could be wrong. I have had ""good luck"" so far, but you never know what may be happening next."
0.666700	Most of my anxiety is the result of concerns about what my diagnosis might be and whether or not my treatment is effective. One of the chronic illnesses I have can have serious, life-threatening consequences if not treated properly as can the medications I take for it. I am not anxious about the actual physical process of being examined, with the exception of paps smears and mammograms as these are sometimes a painful process. I normally choose female physicians for all of my medical procedures and this the direct result of years of interacting with male doctors, many of who did not seem to understand my efforts to communicate symptoms. It may be me or it may have been them, but the end result is that I am much less anxious in any medical situation when I am attended to by a female doctor.
0.333300	I feel most anxious about how the interaction with the doctor will go, how I will be treated as a patient, and whether we can exchange the right amount of information to make informed decisions. 
0.666700	I don't like going to Dr's offices.  I think of sick people and death when I go there.  I lost a child at 19 weeks of pregnancy which makes me even more anxious when I am in a Dr's office.
0.500000	I feel anxious going in for blood work, and while waiting for the test results for cholesterol or diabetes.  I fear the lifestyle changes that may result from bad results.
0.428600	I am sometimes anxious because i do not want to get bad news, or i am worried about the pain of a type of procedure 
0.738100	The most obvious answer for me would be either finding a potentially new problem or having an existing but controllable problem change or get worse.
0.928600	The uncertainty of what's causing my problem makes me anxious or worried.  I have to be really sick and can not find any resolution on my own to go to a doctor.  I will have exhausted all possible natural solutions first before I consult a doctor.  I am anxious of what they will say is wrong and if they will judge me for my actions or inaction.  I worry that something is seriously wrong.  
0.738100	I am always worried and concerned that something serious has developed since my last appointment. Itâs a fear based on nothing in particular 
0.547600	Only when it may result in permanent bad news. I try to stay in good shape and would be nervous to receive unexpected bad news. 
0.476200	I may have lost a ton of weight, but I'm still fat. I still have man boobs, and I absolutely hate taking off my shirt ever. I hate talking to people in a closed room about what's wrong with me.
0.881000	I get very nervous when I have to visit the doctor because I have huge phobia of needles, so I am always worried they will have to run a blood test or give me a tetanus shot or have some reason or another to poke me. I am also always slightly worried they will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer or some incurable disease that only gives me a few months to live. That is always in the back of my mind, that I may be dying or have to get a shot, those are about the only things that worry me about going to the doctor.
0.285700	Well, most of the time I have been to see the doctor is for a symptom that I am aware of and know the severity of it. Only once have I been not knowing and I was anxious but fully relieved after the diagnosis.
0.333300	I feel the most anxious when I have a test and I am waiting for the results. I also feel anxious when I am in a lot of pain and I do not know why. 
0.428600	What makes me most anxious when visiting a doctor's office would be them finding out I have some grave disease. I also feel worried when they overthink things like giving medications or going through procedures that are not necessary.
0.785700	Typically a doctor visit means that something is wrong with my health. Often the results are benign but there's always a chance that the result comes back with a major illness or other issue.
0.809500	I do not like the fact that something might be wrong with me and I can't do anything about it. I do not like receiving shots either.
0.523800	What might be found out, what could be wrong with me.  Especially when going in with a new medical problem, something I haven't really experienced before.
0.714300	I fear I won't be taken seriously, or that I will again be carelessly diagnosed or prescribed another harmful medication.
0.690500	I worry that something may be wrong with me that I don't know about. I worry the doctor will scold me for genuinely bad habits I have, like drinking and smoking, and how that might show in whatever results he is looking at. 
0.238100	Due to my anxiety, I just get worried about going out some places in general. The doctor's is one of those places because I am always worried about what is going on with my body. 
0.976200	I have felt anxious at a DR's appointment when they found something wrong with my health. This usually leads to fear and overthinking a condition or trying to guess the treatment plan.
0.238100	I am most worried that I will not be diagnosed correctly when I am visiting the doctor's office.  This is due to inconsistency with doctors and PAs that I see.
0.500000	If my pain or illness is something that is unsure of it worries me because I think it may be some serious thing that I have never encountered before
0.714300	I worry that the doctor is going to talk to me about my weight. I think that they are focused on it and even if I am just doing something simple they want to weight me.
0.523800	I'm always afraid they might find something bad.  I have chronic abdominal pain and have not been able to get a diagnosis since it began over three years ago. Also, just having to talk to doctors makes me nervous.  I don't know why. It may be because I sometimes have to speak to them for my job and they can be very rude and scary sometimes.
0.500000	I worry that my doctor is going to miss something serious because he is just going through the motions of another physical or exam instead of being meticulous and caring.
0.595200	I usually feel a little exposed and also uneasy about the unknown. There is always a little fear that something may be wrong with me. I am worried that the doctor may judge me for having a little extra weight or for not taking care of myself right. I am pretty self conscious so letting someone see or feel parts of my body that I wouldn't normally expose makes me anxious and uneasy. 
0.714300	"I don't like the possibility of being diagnosed with something bad. I also feel like I will have to do my ""homework"" such as individual research and seeking second opinions before agreeing with what my doctor says."
0.904800	I hate the anual exams, well woman check-ups. They make me anxious and uneasy. I do dread them. I don't know why, I just do. I also hate mamograms. They make me anxious too. They hurt.
0.523800	I am worried about getting bad news, I worry that I might have something terminal. I have medical anxiety so I avoid the doctor a lot.
0.357100	I used to get anxious and worried, but not anymore. My doctor has given me the trust and the confidence that everything is alright and that everything is going to be fine.
0.714300	If I feel I have a serious illness.  I would obviously be afraid because I'm afraid of getting sick.  I like being healthy and being in tip-top shape to do the things I love to do in life.
0.714300	I always get nervous when it comes to my weight because I've had a weight problem for a long time and it has in no way gotten better.
0.785700	Always feel me anxious when I anticipate to see doctor, not for general exam,but probably for X-ray or blood test, or heart test  etc,Because I anticipate bad news, may be a disease or condition will be found.Or scary disease
0.881000	I worry they may call me a liar. I worry they may not trust what I say about what is bothering me. I worry they may tell other people I'm a liar. I worry they may put false things in my medical chart.
0.142900	I don't really experience any anxiety when visiting the doctor.  I treat it as a normal activity that needs to get done. 
0.285700	There always is a feeling of dread that during a physical they will find something new and unexpected. The actual physical is not a problem. Though no one enjoys the blood draw.
0.285700	Concern about what they might find that is wrong with me, and concern that the doctor may not be able to do anything about what is wrong.
0.690500	I do not know what he will do or say. I also fear something being very serious and needing to have to go to the hospital. I am not a fan of hospitals. I have had one surgery, and that is enough for me. I do not want any more. Think about it: One guy knocks you out while another cuts into you with a knife. Not something to make you feel good about.
0.428600	I usually do not feel this way at all whenever i have to go to a doctors office. Again my doctor does a good job of making me feel like im at home, and not uncomfortable. The only time i may have these thoughts slip into my head is if i do not know what is wrong with me and im just acting a bit panicky and uneasy. 
0.666700	I feel anxious that there's going to be something really wrong with me, even if I'm feeling okay.  Just going to the doctor's makes me think about possible problems.
0.285700	Usually nothing makes me feel anxious. If anything would make me feel anxious, I guess it would be that as I get older, I feel more likely to have them find something wrong with me. 
0.690500	I feel worried that something might be wrong with me and don't want to find out the bad news. I also don't like showing my body to my doctor. It can be very awkward.
0.666700	There's not really anything specific that makes me anxious. I think I just dislike getting examined by people in general. 
0.571400	I guess the only thing that truly makes me feel anxious or worried is just stupid bs that's in my head. I feel ashamed of myself for a variety of reasons, especially when it comes to finances and lack of being able to afford insurance. My doctor has never given me a reason to feel these things though, and has actually helped aleve some of these worries and concerns.
0.666700	I feel anxious or worried when I have to remove my clothes. Also, when I am concerned that my problem may be serious.
0.142900	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office when I know my health is not good.  I feel the knowledge that I have about health nutrition can be worrisome when I find myself at a doctorâs office.  I do sometimes get anxious because I was either unaware of my mental condition or physical condition during my visits.  I felt that my physical health was in good standing, but then I take a visit to the doctorâs office, and I am told that I still need to fix my high blood pressure and cholesterol.  Not all visits are worrisome, its just keeping on track with what my doctorâs tells me to do until the next visit.    
0.976200	I'm worried that he is going to give me a difficult diagnosis and if I don't have someone there with me? Like a close friend or family member? I'm not sure how I would handle the situation because No one likes to be alone when bad news is delivered.
0.547600	From time to time I am guilty of thinking along the line of assuming the worst rather than keeping it simple. In those types of thinking cycles it is easy to get worked up about some tests because I can imagine the results will come back telling me I have some horrible disease or worse. The reality is usually less traumatic.
0.619000	When I visit the doctor, I don't know how long I'll end up waiting. Sometimes, I'm worried about what I might find out. I really just don't get a lot of enjoyment from visiting the doctor.
0.952400	I worry about the doctor giving me a lecture about my weight or other lifestyle choices. I am also afraid of being told that something could be wrong with me, especially something that I could have prevented if I had taken care of myself better or come in more urgently. I also worry sometimes if I will be taken seriously when I list my concerns and symptoms, or if they will be brushed off.
0.190500	The situation that makes me feel most uneasy is if my concerns will be brushed off and that I will be treated like I'm overreacting and that I don't know anything. 
0.142900	The only time I feel anxious at the doctor's office is when I feel like I may be receiving bad results.  Other than that I never feel anxious or worried while visiting my doctor's office. My doctor puts my worries at ease.
0.309500	I have white coat syndrome. No matter how many doctors appointments I have I always get nervous! Even if it's a normal check up! My blood pressure rises, and I typically have low blood pressure. But not at the doctor's office! And I know this so then I get nervous about my blood pressure going up, which of course makes it go up more. 
0.452400	I have brain tumors. They've been controlled and benign for a few years now. I'm always fearful they will come alive again or others will develop. I get MRIs a couple times a year, and I'm always anxious waiting to hear the results of those.
0.690500	it's inconvenient to take time out of a work day to be at a doctor's office.  i don't like the feeling that i may or may not get a solution to the problem i came in with.  i don't like not knowing what's wrong with me, and not knowing if the doctor i'm about to see will be able to help or not.  
0.523800	I have a history of respiratory issues, and they pop up fairly often. If I go in for a problem like that, I'm always worried it might be pneumonia again, which I've had several times in the last few years. Other than that, I don't really worry too much when I see the doctor.
0.547600	This is easy, I am always worried about cancer or some unknown thing that will kill me. I am constantly asking questions, trying to understand everything and then making sure without a doubt that I am either fine or take steps to get better.
0.666700	What they thing about me and how am trying to make my health better. Am  so worried about what they are going to say about my health getting bad. What will happen next with me and how long I will have left with my family. Am also worried about if my kids will have the same problems with health like I do and like my mother and grandmother. It runs in the family and has been pasted down thur the years
0.761900	I am a young guy with an old guy's problem. I have a high pain tolerance and have been dealing with my ailment for at least 10 years. Most doctors don't seem to believe me when i say i am in almost unbearable pain. I feel like doctors think i'm lying about my problems to get painkillers which is not the case. I fantasize about the day when I won't need to take any medication. I get very anxious when describing my symptoms and lack of healing or improvement because I feel defensive every time i see a doctor,.
0.761900	I just have a general fear or phobia of doctors and always have had this. I don't like being there and never will
0.142900	i never felt anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office. Its always good to have occasional visit to the primary care physician for preventive care 
0.809500	I think about how much everything is going to cost.  If you have a sore throat they can somehow make that into about $300 in cost.  The appointment?  $160.  The strep test, another $100.  Like, what the hell man!
0.904800	I worry a lot about how I am going to pay for it. Then I wonder if thing are as bad as the seem ur are the trying to get more money. I get scared that they are going to tell me there is something wrong that I can't come back from.
0.785700	I rarely go into the office unless I have noticed something is very wrong with me. I generally tend to let things get to a bad point before reaching out for professional medical help.
0.595200	Since I'm getting older I start to worry that something will be wrong with my heart, or the doctor will say I have to drastically change my diet and all the good foods like cheeseburgers and milkshakes will have to be eliminated. It's mainly just my aging that makes me nervous that this will be the visit where something has gone wrong that I never even noticed.
0.357100	I just get nervous that something could be wrong with me that I am unaware of.  Also getting tests done makes me nervous of the outcome
0.714300	I worry that the doctor will find something that is wrong and needs to be treated but the cost of medical care is so expensive that I will not be able to afford treatment.
0.238100	It's the normal. Everyone is afraid of dying. I'm no different. I'm  anxious that the doctor will find something and it will be something horrible, something fatal, something no one can do anything about. My mother went to the doctor for knee and came out having found out she had a slow moving form of liver disease. It can happen. You can go in with a minor ache or pain and come out knowing what's going to kill you.
0.428600	Usually I get worried because the outcome is unknown and I am not sure what is going to happen. I think alot of this fear is due to not wanting to have some major medical issue come about such as cancer or other very prominent diseases. Also it is not somewhere you go very often and is usually associated with death, illness and pain so these places are naturally scary to someone who doesnt go often or is awaiting a bill of health. Also the cost is another concern and can cause stress in someone who visits because something simple can still be expensive. 
0.785700	I have had nurses and doctors underestimate pain, so I am constantly worried that I will not be taken seriously or believed. 
0.547600	Even if I'm perfectly healthy for some reason I get a little anxious because you can never know what will really happen. There are people younger than me that have died from cancer and horrible things, so it's always in the back of my mind.
0.714300	From the beginning, when they leave you in the room alone after taking your basic vitals is nerve wracking. It's you alone in a room and you don't know if they've forgotten you and you constantly run through all the possible worst-case-scenarios in your mind. Being alone is the scary part. 
0.785700	I feel worried and anxious that I will receive bad results or told that I am dying. I'm worried I'm not living a healthy enough lifestyle and it will show up on my tests.
0.190500	"I am usually not anxious or worried. I suppose I would be if I was expecting a test result that could possibly be ""bad news."""
0.857100	I was struggling with a condition that i did research on and found out that the symptoms matched a disease i feared greatly so when i went to my doctor and told him of my symtoms he scheduled some tests and an exam, during the exam i had all if these feelings because i feared receiving the news that i was right.
0.523800	I always think there is going to be something wrong with me, or it will be even more negative I get worried cause all of my health issues.
0.857100	I don't like the feeling of not knowing what they are going to do to me. I hate blood and I hate needles. I like to know what to expect when I go places.
0.238100	I am most anxious when I see a needle for a shot because I have a strong physical reaction to them and feel uncomfortable, but I know it will pass
0.285700	I am always worried that I may get bad news in any dr office. I am nervous I may get bad news and I may get. 
0.714300	Sometimes I feel like I'm going to learn news that I cannot unhear. That I will hear that I am finally dying and that I cannot do anything more to prevent the ill fate that has been thrust upon me.
0.785700	I feel worried or anxious when visiting the doctors because I am not used to doing so. I don't like how white and clean and empty the patient rooms are, how odd and sterile they are. I don't like having the possibility to be told that there is something seriously wrong with me either.
0.857100	Well, having been misdiagnosed and, on other occasions, groped by doctors in an inappropriate sexual way (especially by 2 ob/gyn practitioners) has resulted in my being anxious and worried whenever I visit. One misdiagnosis nearly cost me my life--thank goodness I was able to figure out what was wrong--I then marched back to the doctor's office and demanded the right course of treatment. I have also been subject to Dr. Perverts--as in two ob/gyns who sought fit to check my breasts for cysts by groping them for long periods of times. One ob/gyn even closed his eyes and smiled as he squeezed my breasts and told me afterwards how beautiful my breasts were. Suffice to say, I feel anxious, worried and very much on guard when visit the doctor's office. 
0.523800	I generally feel anxious or worried.  I feel uncomfortable and cold in the doctor's office.  I am usually stressed because I've had to drive in traffic from a distance.  I get social anxiety.  I am sometimes a bit uncertain about the results.  When I get checkups, I am generally expecting them to go well especially if I haven't had any issues prior to coming.  But you never know if some test result or exam comes back questionable and you have something serious or concerning wrong with you.  Or some expensive testing procedure that of course insurance won't cover.  Money and pricing is always a concern with doctor visits.  Sometimes I feel strange that every doctor can see all my previous digital health information which makes me uncomfortable.  Many times I feel violated for having to sign away all my rights in the paperwork.  And the office staff is usually rude and abrupt and treats you less than humanely.
0.381000	bad news about my health and the cost of treatments. sometimes visiting doctor and the lab exams he ask me to take may turn up to be costly
0.523800	Getting bad, difficult or negative health news, is what makes me most anxious about visiting the Doctor's.
0.142900	I worry that my diagnosis will be worse than I think and will result in a more serious disease than I initially thought
0.285700	My doctor's office has always been very kind and welcoming. The only things that can make me feel anxious at my doctors office are the financial and insurance aspects of my visit. Even then the people there are always understanding and willing to try and accommodate my every need.
0.404800	No one wants to get on the scale.  Unless they've been losing weight, everyone thinks they weigh too much.  Especially me!
0.738100	I always worried they are going to disregard what I am telling them or that I am making stuff up. I feel that there really not going to help with the issues.
0.595200	That they will discover something that is seriously wrong with me that I did not know about or did not have any symptoms for
0.357100	"I just think the overall of feeling of  ""what are they going to say about my current health status.""  Once the examination is completed and they begin to talk, I'm no longer anxious"
0.666700	I get most worried or anxious when I visit the doctor's office, whenever I have to take my little one to see a doctor. I get more worried because I don't take my kids to the doctor unless they are really ill and I see a lot of media talking about really dangerous, possibly deadly, flu's and other illnesses out there. I worry about these because a child can easily get these illnesses from just being at the store and someone sneezes or coughs. They can even get sick if someone coughed on an item in the store and I touch it and then hold my kids. Being a parent is already worrying but having to worry about their health whenever something like this arises, is very stressful and irritating because I tend to get really antsy and nervous while waiting for the doctor's diagnosis. I had to take my daughter to the ER a few times because she had a high fever temperature, and at the time there was a big outbreak of the flu that was nationwide and causing deaths for some young kids and the elderly. Because of this reason, I decided to take my daughter to the doctor to make sure she was alright. She ended up being fine but just the information on the news and the media and her being sick just made the whole situation nerve wrecking. 
1.000000	Money. I have no insurance so if there's something serious and I have to be rushed to the hospital, I will never be able to pay for it. I would rather they just leave me on the examination table to die than help at that point. I'm already in debt because of college loans; I literally can't afford to be in any more debt than I already am.
0.142900	I feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor if I have had some signs that something might be wrong.  Also, when I have my yearly exam I always hold my breath until my blood work comes back.  I am always afraid that something might show that something is wrong.
0.738100	"I worry I am not being taken seriously and that I am going to be told or made to think ""it is all in my head"". I worry that they are in such a rush that they will not really listen and hear me or my concerns. I worry that ""because I am young"", they are going to assume everything is fine and I have nothing to worry about."
0.904800	I always worry that an incurable problem will be discovered and /or that I will find out terrible news about my health.
0.928600	I worry about needing painful procedures. Even innoculations scare me. I cannot stand the thought of a needle piercing my flesh and gouging a hole in a muscle. I get all worried and my blood pressure sky rockets as I enter the doctor's office.No matter what I do to calm down I remain very anxious.
0.285700	My family is prone to diabetes, high blood pressure and even a case of ovarian cancer.  I am not typically worried or anxious unless I have a pain or illness I cannot identify as a familiar feeling.
0.857100	I'm always anxious and worried while in the doctor's office because I don't want negative or bad news
0.142900	The only thing that makes me anxious or worried is that my concerns will be ignored. Which they usually are.
0.785700	I am always anxious when seeing my doctor. If I am not feeling well I seem to worry about what is wrong with me. I worry that it will be something serious. I get nervous for just about anything that has to do with a physical examination. It makes me feel uncomfortable. 
0.642900	It isn't the doctor's office that makes me anxious. I deal with anxiety on and ongoing basis. If anything were to make me nervous, it would be the waiting time.
0.571400	I think that the time constraints upon my doctor visit. I don't know what to discuss with them and it seems that if I bring up too much, I may be charged for an extra visit. And, when I bring up something with my primary care physician, it will probably result in one or more referrals which I prefer to avoid.
0.547600	I don't want to figure out I have cancer or some other type of illness.  I also feel anxious cause I have to get home to my kids and the doctor's wait times can be long.
0.785700	I always feel like they are not looking at serious underlying conditions that are not so obvious.  They never seem to want to do any tests that would uncover internal issues.
0.404800	Because of the uncertainly of what's really going on is what I get anxious or worried about when I go see my doctor.
0.285700	Waiting in the waiting room makes me anxious about being stuck there for a long period of time.  I hate being late or being stuck somewhere
0.142900	If I'm in there for a specific reason, I can feel anxious sometimes. Even with that, I know that they will do the best they can to help me or find someone who can help. 
0.238100	I'm most anxious about what the doctor might find.  I worry about possible diagnoses and what they could mean for my future.  
0.547600	I am most anxious that I am going to get some bad news about a problem I have no control over and there is nothing I can do about it
0.500000	I AM ALWAYS WORRIED THAT I WILL HAVE A FATILE DIAGNOSIS IF I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY OWN BODY.
0.142900	I very rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctors office. My doctor puts me at ease with any issues or concerns that may come up. The only times I have ever felt anxious or worried, were after having testing done, that could come back with negative results and indicate I have health issues. 
0.571400	if i was really sick or in pain and i didnt know why then i would be fearful, other than that im usually very calm
0.619000	I have a chronic condition that killed my mother. I am always worried that it will become worse. Secondly is the unknown. By that I mean what if something new has cropped up? I am a passenger in this body and I will not get a second one. There is always the uncertainty of the unknown.
0.381000	I sometimes am worried about the outcome or what I may find out. Don't want there to be something wron with me. that is waht I get most worried about.
0.142900	I think the thing that makes me feel most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me and don't know if the doctor will know as well. When I was diagnosed with chronic hives I was always anxious or worried when meeting with the allergist because I wasn't confident that the hives would go away and the situation would be resolved. The fear of them not knowing what to do when I have no idea what to do is what gets me worked up. 
0.833300	I really do not like being there in the first place and then having them tell me what I am doing wrong in my life makes it that much worse. I am worried that they will tell me something bad or find something really wrong with me. I am almost in the mindset that it is better not to know what is going on. I know that is bad but I worry way to much about everything to begin with. 
0.928600	I am worried that the doctor is going to tell me that I have something seriously wrong. Ever since my dad's cancer diagnosis 4 years ago (and his ensuing death in 2015) I have been close to terrified every time I have to see the doctor. 
0.428600	Hearing bad news or being told that you have a medical condition. Also if the doctor will be caring about the health of his/her patients.
0.928600	I don't like to be undressed in a doctor's office. I don't like to show my body to anyone but my husband. I hate getting tests done and i don't know the results of the test
0.285700	The thing(s) that make me most anxious while visiting the doctors office is the unknown. Sometimes when I am sick and do not understand why, the waiting to find out causes more anxiety than what it is worth.
0.690500	Most things make me anxious, so it is not necessarily a special occasion. I do not do well with uncertainty, so if it something beyond a checkup or the like, enter: anxiety.
0.357100	Don't really like someone proding or poking me or asking personal questions. I also don't like the idea of something going on that I may not be aware of that could have major complications on my life and my family. 
0.666700	Basically, I have a constant fear that Iâm dying. Cancer, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, brain tumors,
0.547600	I hate waiting. They ask all these questions and when you're healthy it just seems like a waste of time. I could have filled out a form and gotten the same answer: You are well.
0.285700	I'm worried that I won't present my case or issues well, and that I'll be brushed aside. My doctor doesn't have intimate knowledge of my history, and I'm worried I'll somehow leave out information that would help them identify my problems.
0.404800	I often worry I have a new medical condition or that an old condition has returned. If that happened I would have to take new medications and have longer visits with my doctors.
0.142900	Well honestly I rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor.  The only time I can see myself being worried about my condition is when I have something that might be seriously wrong with me and it is more of a reaction to the condition than to the doctors visit itself.  I tend to be a pretty calm individual in most situations so it rarely ever comes up.  Though what exactly makes me worried more than anything is simply the possibility of a condition that can only be treated and not cured but I think that is something that bothers most people in general.
0.785700	The cold sterile setting is rather unnerving, causing my anxiety levels to skyrocket. Knowing that anything I say to the doctor could be taken out of context and cost me my License/Job/Freedom due to a simple misunderstanding. The waiting can also cause stress and worry. It seems to take forever for a doctor to even make it into the room to examine you, and even longer to come back and explain what steps are next. Finally, Even when I know what is wrong, or the reason I am there and try to explain why or what helps because I've been through it before, I'm treated like an idiot or a criminal, or a faker while they order more tests to make my bill even higher. 
0.428600	I am the kind of person who always gets nervous in a doctors office. I just get nervous about the fact that they could find something wrong. Typically, I calm down once I start talking but I am still a bit on edge until I leave even if I have a great visit. I think it is just a natural fear inside of me. 
0.285700	I am very comfortable in doctor's offices and in hospital surroundings. I grew up in that environment because my mom worked at a hospital, and so I was always there and the other doctors were friendly and doting toward me. So, I am never anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office unless I fear or expect something is very wrong with me.
0.785700	That the doctor is just going to say anything. That doctors dont care to actually really examine a patient. They just have a goal to prescribe a prescription for anything and any reason.
0.642900	i am anxious or worried about what might be the diagnosis , scared of any new illnesses or anything that will make me have to come back for any sort of treatment
0.547600	I just don't like having to go to the doctor. The waiting around, being around other people. Feeling like I might be wasting their time. 
0.976200	I'm honestly not scared of needles, shots or anything like that. I have many tattoos and piercings so to me a shot or needle is nothing at all. I get so uneasy and worried to the point that I'm nauseous. I think it's because I overly worry that the doctor is going to find something or say I'm sick with something, I'll need further testing elsewhere, or I have only a few months to live. I know that's like the extreme, but that really terrifies me just incase. I also worry that the doctor or nurses know something I don't and they won't tell me and talk about it behind my back or something weird like that.
0.261900	Worried that the diagnosis will be negative and effect my life. If it involves a procedure I get worried about the pain and not being able to control it when I leave the doctors office. 
0.785700	First and foremost, I hate going to the doctor office simply because I do not want to be around other sick people.  I'm afraid that I might pick up some sickness from someone else and then end up feeling actually worse than I already was feeling.  Also, I hate just sitting in the doctor office because it seems like they are so slow about calling you back to actually see the doctor.
0.381000	I am always anxioius or nervous because you never know what they will find. I am also nervous about the cost and what my insurance will cover.
0.142900	I do not get nervous when visiting the doctor's office. Getting anxious accomplishes nothing so I do not waste my energy on it.
0.904800	I am the most anxious that the paper gowns will not fit me. As crazy as it seems I do not want to sit on a paper table in a paper gown. I hate that part. I would rather sit in a cloth gown! They never close and then the paper blanket is usually a joke as well. It is frustrating. I also hate giving blood and that process of waiting to be called to do that. I often say I would run away if I could then we laugh. I mean it though. I know it is necessary but those two things: gowns and blood are my issues.
0.285700	I'm a cancer survivor, so I always worry that something seriously wrong will be found. Certain exams are more uncomfortable than others. Sometimes, I feel anxious about possible pain.
0.666700	I get anxious about what I want to discuss.  The things that I typically want to discuss are sensitive subjects including anxiety and depression.  Additionally, I have a tragic history with healthcare outcomes, and I'm often forced to bring it up when discussing my healthcare history.  This makes me anxious, because I don't want to cry or feel depressed in front of the doctor.  I also get anxious about getting new medications or getting blood draws.  I dislike anything painful, and I get nervous when I am about to get test results.
0.690500	The not knowing what might happen.  Also the overall wait time.  It seems to take forever between the check in and check out process
0.619000	I tend to get anxious about having to go to the doctor's because of the unfamiliar environment and what the possible outcome is during my visit. I also get worried about the drive there because I don't like driving. I also feel uneasy having to explain my problems, especially if they're embarrassing. 
0.166700	I fear that something will be wrong with me, that I will be sick and I won't know it, and when they find out it will be too late.  But that is just a general feeling and doesn't really have too much to do with doctor visits, per se.
0.142900	I worry a little bit that a disease might be found...my dad had cancer for instance, I want to avoid that.
0.285700	The only thing that would make me feel anxious when visiting a doctor is if I have something that could potentially be serious. I would be worried about it being something worse than what I think it is.
0.238100	I am hoping to get the most out of my visit. I want to be able to be comfortable with my doctor for future purposes.
0.714300	It is a little unnerving having to unclothe and have a doctor prod around in private areas. I know it has to be done, but it makes me uncomfortable.  I am anxious about the exam itself more than finding out something is wrong.  Doctors try to make patients feel comfortable about this, but it's not easy. 
0.142900	I feel anxious or worried if there is a new employee .Example the person who take your blood. If he or she is new I do not know if they have enough experience.. I will not let them  stick me with a needle several times to get blood.
0.619000	My history is long, and results from an accident many years back. The accident was serious and my injuries very severe. I continually deal with residual complications from that accident and also tend to develop new conditions as time goes on and I get older. Its almost impossible for me at this point to not have anxiety after my checkups.
0.547600	My blood pressure always goes higher in the doctor's office. I check it at home and know what it is.  Then I get a lecture on the blood pressure and then I get a lecture on my weight.
0.642900	Finding out the worst case scenario, even though it is usually very simple treatment. For example going in for a cough and being diagnosed with cancer.
0.738100	I am often unsure of what protocol my doctor will implement. I also feel insecure abut myself and physical condition and this makes me anxious in the doctor's office.
0.690500	I am most anxious if they grab my nuts. I hate when they have to examine everywhere it's just uncomfortable and they need a new procedure. That is just wierd.
0.642900	I'm not sure.  Even though my doctor is one of the best ones I have been to, I still get nervous at the visits.
0.142900	Nothing at all.  I feel completely calm and collected when I visit his office.  The only issue I ever have is somebody bringing a loud obnoxious child to the office with them but that doesn't really have anything to do with the office itself.
0.523800	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office is them finding something that is seriously wrong with me. In some degree, everyone fears dying and living a lifestyle where they virtually have none. I do not go to see a doctor very often at all and when I do, It's usually for something pretty serious. Therefore I worry a bit because I obviously do not completely know how the outcome may be.
0.523800	The unknown variables of health tend to make me feel most anxious and worried. Especially when dealing with critical or chronic conditions, the downsides to health complications can be dire and that is something that I would rather avoid.
0.785700	I feel uncomfortable in general in a doctor's office. I feel worried about being touched by someone who is generally a stranger.
0.404800	I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN MY DOCTOR SO I'M USUALLY NOT ANXIOUS OR WORRIED. IT MAY COME TO THAT SOME DAY BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T. EVEN NOW WITH MY LAST CT SCAN IT SHOWS A SPOT ON MY LUNG HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I'M NOT TO WORRIED ABOUT IT YET. MAYBE IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE.
0.738100	Test results are usually the because factor because I feel like the doctors sometimes focus on the test result and no other factors. I feel like I shouldn't be the only one fighting for my health. 
0.738100	When it comes to visiting the doctor the thing that makes me the most worried is simply not knowing how things will you. I hate that there is a possibility that I can get some really bad news that would cost me financially, physically or mentally. It's very nerve racking. 
0.547600	Potentially having something life threatening wrong with me. My doctor missing something important. Having to take medicines with terrible side effects.
0.690500	I'm worried that a doctor will order a test that will result in negative results (negative meaning detrimental to my health). Sometimes it's easier not knowing that something is wrong than confirming that there is a problem.
0.595200	I have a medical condition that can get worse over time.  It could require surgery and this makes me anxious about doctor's visits.  I don't delay making an appointment likely because of my good relationship with the doctor.
0.738100	I am not good with needles, and I have had a bad experience in the past when they pricked my finger. I almost passed out, so they had to take me back into a room. I ended up having a blood blister and bruising on my finger for the next few days. 
0.142900	Nothing, I know that I am in good hands with my present doctor. Previous to him I would be anxious and scared because I knew that I was wasting my Co pay on not being treated for my issues. I o lying go to the doctors office maybe once or twice a year, when something is severe, so I am in no way shape or form a hypochondriac. 
0.142900	I worry that I will get sick from other people there.  I worry that I will hold the doctors back with my long appointments. I worry that my insurance will not cover something.
0.571400	I am afraid that he will find something really wrong with me like cancer or something.  Iâve never had anything like that and am in good health but am always afraid when I go to the doctor just for a checkup they will find something like that.
0.428600	exams are unpleasant,  worry about what might be found.  not fun sitting in a paper gown waiting 30 mins in a cold room for the dr to show up.   
0.500000	I'm not really sure what makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office.  Maybe it's the feeling of not being 'perfect' - not eating well enough, not having the perfect weight, not having the perfect blood pressure, etc. - and it seems that the doctor is always finding fault with something.
0.595200	I feel anxious or worried that my doctor will find something else wrong with me. I'd rather not hear it or know about it, to be honest
1.000000	I have high blood pressure and it elevates in the office.  I don't want more medications as it is fine otherwise. However, my doctor just keeps adding more even though I have it taken by a nurse at the school I teach in and it is so very much lower - normal in fact. 
0.214300	My family has an extensive history of health issues and each time I go to my doctor I am concerned that he is going to find something or diagnose a condition.  Often times I am waiting on the test results to see if everything is fine or not and that makes me anxious.
0.714300	That they are going to tell me that something is seriously wrong with me. Not really anything in particular but that something will require some surgery or a massive change in lifestyle. I always think about having cancer, or how scared I would be if I had to undergo a major surgery. If I'm going in for say blood tests, I'm going to worry that my blood tests are going to show that I have major health issues, etc. I still always have these worries and fears, despite the fact that I've yet to have anything like that occur. It's always something minor, but I always am terrified of something major.
0.523800	For me to show up at the doctor's office with a complaint means that I am acknowledging that I am experiencing something that is beyond my capability and that I need help with. Just there I am going to be anxious going in. And if there are concerns shown for my tale of woe and tests ordered than I am going to be a little bit worried just not knowing what the test will show.
0.761900	I am anxious that there is something wrong with me that I am unaware of. I am anxious that I have some condition that is uncurable or chronic or otherwise scary.
0.523800	Cancer is always a fear and imaging scares me in case of that. After diagnosis where medications can help, I feel better.
0.476200	The thing that worries me is not so much what he is telling me as a patient, but what he is not telling me for some reason outside of my best interest. I am definitely worried that he may not be as thourough as he should be, or that his recommendationas could have a negative impact.
0.642900	I feel most anxious if I am actively having a health issue and have to wait a long time to be seen. Waiting a long time causes me to go to worst case scenario in my mind and by the time I'm in the exam room I am sometimes a bit nervous.
0.214300	What would make me feel anxious is if they were new in treating me. I would worry about whether or not we would have a good rapport. I would also worry about whether or not they were a holistic doctor or if they just wanted to push pills. I would also feel anxious if I was worried I had something bad going on. 
0.714300	My blood pressure results, first off. It always runs really high. And I hate to see my weight because I really need to lose about 15-20 pounds. Also, they always ask me about smoking and drinking, of course, and I am a little embarrassed by how much I do of both because I know that should be less.
0.142900	doctors visits usually never make me feel ill at ease. i am in pretty good health and dont have much to worry about.
0.500000	I usually get worried about any of the tests that they decide to do and whether it is going to be painful or not. I also worry about the potential diagnosis I get, and whether it is going to be life hindering. But mostly, I worry that they don't detect the illness in time and it ends up getting to the point where they can't treat it anymore. 
0.309500	I am afraid that they WON'T listen to me or treat me like an individual and a real person and will rush through and only give me about 8 minutes of their time and not even ask if I have any questions.
0.595200	I am anxious about my condition, whether it is improved or worsened. Because I am really trying to take care of myself with respect to this condition, I am really worried if it is not working in the good direction.
0.833300	When I go in for something where I'm not sure what the diagnosis is going to be.  Like in my latest example regarding the cyst found in my thigh.  When I went in for examination, I didn't know if it was going to be a tumor or cancerous or a blood clot.  If I was just going in for a physical checkup, it wouldn't be as nerve racking.  However, even then, you never know if they're going to find something wrong with you and that is always a little unnerving.
0.214300	Uncertainty about a diagnosis that I am concerned about. It's hard not to let information on the internet cloud your judgment, which can lead to anxiety about a diagnosis.
0.238100	There's always some amount of concern and anxiety associated with getting test results, because you never know what they might show. 
0.261900	I just have a general anxiety that I'm not providing the correct information or that there is something wrong that I don't know about. I also don't like needles or pain so I get uneasy that blood tests will be ordered.
0.547600	I am always anxious that there will be bad result or bad news.  I also am a little uncertain that the doctor is taking my actual thoughts or words into consideration. I know that he actually went to medical school but I live with me and know how I feel and what I am experiencing and to have a doctor disregard and dismiss my thoughts is upsetting.  I also do not like going to doctors I do not know who fill in because of bad experiences with rude doctors.
0.285700	When visiting a new doctor's office for the first time I often feel worried they won't be able to help me fully or prescribe a medication that works for my body.
0.190500	Typically, its a situation when I know something is wrong with me, but I'm also aware that the costs may be too expensive to do anything about. I had a tonsil infection, and I was unable to eat comfortably for days. I didn't know how much the medicine would cost and I had to pay out of pocket. It cost me $300 at the urgent care to get treated and to be able to eat again. It's always an affordability issue.
0.285700	That i might not get what i want done. That iâll pay a lot of money for no benefits.  I do not have anxiety about visits.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing if there is anything wrong with me when it seems like there is not. It is also just the unknown and maybe the doctor having to bear that bad news to tell me. There is also me having to worry what the doctor will think too. 
1.000000	I have a major fear of doctors and my health in general. I am always afraid that  I will be diagnosed with something or made to have a procedure that will cause me pain. It terrifies me that we put so much trust in doctors and that what they say could change the course of my life. I am probably overreacting though.
0.452400	I feel most anxious when there is an awkward kind of conversation, I'd rather just sit and listen to music or something and relax than have to converse.
0.714300	I'm anxious about being around people in general, and going to the doctor is not too much better. I am in good health thankfully, so I usually only go in for minor stuff.
0.500000	That I might get a bad diagnos8s I fear that something might be really wrong with me I also don't like needles so I am scared I might need to take a shot
0.642900	I am often anxious that I will be judged if I speak the truth about my health care needs and concerns. I am concerned that I am sent to different doctors who ultimately don't have answers for what is going on with me. I am worried my doctor will continue to push me to take meds that I suffer side effects from. I worry that I will fail to convince my doctor that I am really having problems.
0.642900	I'm always afraid that I will catch something there. I also, feel anxious that I will have a bad test result. I worry they will find something seriously wrong with me. 
0.619000	I just don't know what problems may pop up. I usually am healthy but recently I've been feeling a lot of different stuff. 
0.523800	I worry whether or not I will receive bad news. The longer I go without seeing a doctor the worse this feeling becomes. Similar to the dentist.
0.285700	I am usually not anxious or worried about visiting the Dr.  I have had many procedures that would probably worry most people but I tend to take it in stride.
0.285700	It depends on the reason for the visit. If it is for a minor ailment, there is no reason to be anxious. I have no reason to feel anxious about a visit unless I the doctor gives me reason to be. i.e. bad health news
0.595200	I feel most anxious at the doctor when  I have an unexpected pain that I need looked at. I get anxious because I never know what the outcome will be. I have a huge fear of cancer, not a fear of dying from it but a fear of having to fight it.
0.642900	I only go to the office when something is bothering me, so I am worried about my condition at the time. I am bad about thinking the worse, so I tend to dwell on that until I see the doctor.
0.571400	Probably being told that there are more serious issues than I though there was and having to do more treatment. 
0.619000	My doctor is very blunt, so when I go to him I am a little nervous. He will tell me if I gained weight and he will usually talk about it with me constantly throughout the visit.  I'm usually worried that he will tell me that there is something seriously wrong with me. Thats been my fear for awhile. I just hate sitting in the office because I feel like there are a lot of germs and I will get sick.
0.190500	Even though I rarely experience health concerns, I have a  few family members that have been effected by chronic illnesses that have started as benign problems. The fear of finding out something serious in an appointment persists.
0.690500	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor is the possibility of finding out something is seriously wrong with me.
0.666700	I feel anxious or worried because I can never tell if my blood pressure will be of a normal reading and that is one of my biggest concerns
0.333300	That there might be something seriously wrong with me, my heart rate or oxygen levels are down, my blood work came back bad, the pain in feeling is something bad.
0.666700	I'm a single mom. I have two teenagers who rely on me and my financial and emotional support. I am the one constant in their lives. The one person they couldn't live without.  This is mainly the reason for my anxiousness when I visit the Dr's. I want to be there for my children as long as I possibly can.
0.642900	Mostly waiting a long time in general makes me nervous and it seems like waiting is longer than the actual exam from the doctor. Other than that, it's fear of having some kind of illness.
0.523800	Mostly it's the unknown. I certainly don't want to be sick, but being that I haven't kicked the smoking addiction, I know at some point I will be. 
0.595200	That they will schedule a bunch of extra test just so they can bill the insurance companies for more.
0.738100	I worry that they will overlook my symptoms because they do not understand the complexities of my illness or that they do not take my condition seriously enough to educate themselves on it. 
0.714300	I have an innate fear of going to the doctor. For no apparent reason either. It is the fear of what the doctor would say, and finding something wrong with me. There is also the aspect where I would have to do things that are uncomfortable to myself, such as things that should stay private. On top of that, it is seeing the bill afterwards and paying it. 
0.357100	I'm worried to get bad news and I don't particulary enjoy needles. I try to, however, be mature and remain realistic. Whether we're perfectly healthy or struggling with a medical condition, we just have to do our best to achieve the best quality of life and health as possible.  
0.142900	I would only visit a doctor if I was pretty sure there was something seriously wrong with me, so the higher source of stress would be whatever that is.
0.690500	Visiting the doctor can be worrying if you think she might find something bad or you don't know what's wrong. It can also be a relief if you know you're going to get better from something that's bothering you.
0.285700	I tend to consider worst case scenarios when I head to the doctor's office; if I have some kind of pain or ailment, I tend to assume it is something awful and imagine the worst possible results. By the time I get to the doctor, I feel like he is close to confirming my worst fears, even if I'm actually fine.
0.309500	The worst issue when visiting a doctor's office the the unknown factors.  The problem may be something simple or complex, the solution may be expensive and troublesome or it may be inexpensive and simple and the overall experience may feel good or bad, but the unknown factors involved make the experience worse.
0.619000	With everything all over social media and the news sometimes it makes it hard not to think about what ifs.  Everything is bad for you now so with every appointment it makes me wonder what could they find, is this the visit.  I question every choice I have made since my last appointment.  Also I am very hard on myself, so I always worry what the doctors or nurses think of me.
0.595200	The only thing that could make me anxious is the feeling of uncertainty, when things aren't plain and sure I feel uneasy. Usually the results good or bad donât scare me but the lack of feedback and information does. Sure as a normal human you should be worried if your health isn't looking good but I usually keep things under control so as far as I can control my health is in a good standard which is why uncertainty would make me anxious, as for 'bad' results all you can do is follow the protocol and recover as best as possible.
0.714300	You never know what to expect the doctor to say. Especially if you aren't going on a regular basis then you will never know what to expect from the doctor. example waiting on blood work to process can be the most dreadful expereince as it leads to the patient waiting a day or two before results are complied. the anxious stage of mind comes into play when you are a student in school and waiting the teacher to tell you what grade you may have. This is the same factor that applies to the doctors room when you are always waiting on results.. 
0.595200	I feel anxious when I know that he is checking for new problems to an existing condition.  So far everything has turned out okay, but I still tend to get anxious and a little bit worried.
1.000000	"The eyes they give me and the most thing I worry about and makes me feel uneasy is whether they will drop something bad on me such as ""there's nothing we can do""."
0.595200	I worry that I will get a positive test result for a chronic condition. For example, recently my tests showed that I have high cholesterol. 
0.595200	When I need specific medication my doctor is very judgemental and when I ask for specific stuff i read about online he totally hates on the ideas and takes a very holier than though attitude with me and says no to any sort of request I make so he makes me nervous
0.738100	Because I only get to see a doctor when there is something wrong, I am always waiting for the bad news.  I need to see a specialist or I need to go on a new medication which I probably won't be able to pay for.  So, that just puts more stress in my life and makes me anxious at the doctor's office.  In many ways, it's just less stressful to live with whatever problem I have and not go see a doctor who will just tell me about the problem that I can't do anything about because I can't afford the co-pay.
0.714300	I am not comfortable getting naked in front of man I do not know.  I do not think that healthcare providers give a patient enough information about what they will be doing BEFORE they do it which makes me very jumpy.  I do not get in another person's personal space without permission or without telling them what I am doing.  I don't think it's too much to ask of virtual strangers especially when I am already naked and vulnerable.  I worry about what tests I will be told I need as many of them are painful or at least uncomfortable especially when someone has an issue with the sight of needles.  I worry about being diagnosed with a condition that could mean significant lifestyle changes or death.
0.142900	Generally the only time I am anxious is if I am taking a blood test or other test regarding Cholesterol, blood pressure etc to make sure I am in normal zones and taking care of myself. 
0.714300	The things that make me feel most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is that they will not make the proper diagnosis and that they will not give me a good enough medication for my ailments.  How could a doctor properly diagnose everything after such quick examinations?  Also, doctors are now so worried about being sued that they will not prescribe medications with addiction potential.  These drugs have worked well for a century and now we must use inferior drugs just because some people decide to abuse the drugs.
0.357100	At the doctors, I feel most worried if when I do not feel listened too.  I have faith in my doctors to monitor my symptoms and take appropriate treatment.  However, when I feel that they are rushed or thinking about other things - it makes me feel uneasy.  Sometimes, I think that doctors are overworked and take on too many patients.  Their offices are revolving doors.  I wonder if all needs are being met or if they are rushing through one patient to get to the next.  Additionally, I wonder what they would perscribe or treat if they did not have to worry about insurance.
0.619000	I am worried that I wont be heard or listened to. I have had experiences where I have been told that the issue I have will go away with time and sometimes it hasn't. I try to ask questions, only to be passed off to someone else and I have to explain things all over again.
0.833300	I normally only go to the doctor's office when I know something is wrong. Finding out what is wrong makes me very anxious. I often go to the doctor's office alone, so it makes me nervous to have to deal with that.
0.690500	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is fear of the unknown. Sometimes I worry something might be seriously wrong with me.
0.166700	There is a little healthy anxiousness that I fear each time I go to the doctor because of the unknown of what could be found.
0.595200	I hate going to a doctor's office when it's not my choice to do so. But my birth control medication is needed for my continued well being on a daily basis and my doctor will not give me more of them unless I submit to an examination every so often, despite said examination is very painful and unpleasant and totally unnecessary in my situation. 
0.285700	If I am going to worry about attending a doctors visit, the thing that would make me the most nervous is not meeting or following through with their instructions.   Then having to face them, and explain why I didn't meet their goal or follow their advice.
0.404800	When a doctor makes minor indications that something is wrong, it is my natural response to assume the worst even though it is very rarely the case.
0.714300	I think the internet is a big contributing factor to me feeling anxious, because I often go online to research symptoms and of course I think the worse. More than likely if is never what I worry about. The other worry of course is what the cost of things will be.
0.642900	Because he doesn't have a good bedside manner. I've only been seeing him for 2 years when my other doctor retired. I was hoping this doctor would recommend me seeing a nutritionist, but I didn't speak up about it this time. I don't really want to start searching for a new doctor, either. Guess I have to live with it.
0.642900	"We have to overcome that, especially the quality of cadres. "" I am very grateful for that statement and argue that ""reform"" of the human person is also a must for many branches and administrative bodies. We are not only interested in training professional staff, but also require them to behave civilly and friendly when interacting and working with people."
0.714300	I have a reoccurring hernia and I am afraid she will see it and tell me I need to have surgery again. Also I am afraid when my blood pressure goes up or my cholesterol. 
0.285700	What I feel most anxious or worried about when visiting the doctor's office is probably the wait of the actual appointment. I could not get into the doctor for a month with a condition that had me worried it was something serious. Unfortunately, the doctor was booked up and then when the appointment came, the doctor was with another patient for a little longer than scheduled so I appreciate her being with someone else and helping them but the waiting game was making me anxious.
0.857100	The amount of germs in the buildings are enough to make your skin crawl never mind the waiting games and lack of compassion for it at times
1.000000	They have a definite lack of communications skills, and bedside manner, forget it. They either talk down to you or not much at all.
0.547600	I am usually worried about being told that there is something severely wrong, which will lead to more problems in my life for myself and friends and family
0.309500	Finding out what is wrong with me gets me worried. I think I donât want to know whatâs wrong or it worries me a little bit 
0.309500	It makes me most anxious when I call to get advice from the doctor, and it takes weeks to receive a response. If I don't proactively call them daily, I may not be given any information.
0.690500	I have a heart condition that while stable and not harmful right now, needs to be monitored.  Every time I see him I worry that my condition has change and I may require surgery. 
0.714300	I might have forgotten to do something or take a medicine she suggested. I might forget what I want to say. Maybe some medical problem will interfere with my career.
0.238100	Generally, I'm not really a worrier, but if I were to worry about anything, I would worry most about learning that there is something wrong with me that is not easy to fix.
0.142900	What makes me most nervous when going to the doctor is that I will get bad news that is not easy to fix with medicine or anything else quick and easy.
0.333300	I feel most anxious during the very few times I have been really sick, or am having some kind of pain, especially the internal kind.
0.238100	first of all, I don't experience at all any anxious emotions or worries because I know that these places and persons are there for real help.
0.642900	The intimacy of some tests. Pap smears are generally painful; don't look forward to those. And at age 59, I'm running into problems I never thought about at younger ages, like changes in cholesterol and bone density. So even though I'm in pretty good health, at the very least, I have to wonder what fresh age-related disease I'll be at risk of next.
0.833300	"Again, I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life. I always worry that my current doctor will get overwhelmed and ""give up"" trying to find solutions to help my quality of life increase. I am very anxious that she will not be able to work with my specialists who treat my many conditions."
0.476200	When I am most anxious or worried at the doctors office is when I am having lab work done. Waiting on the lab results makes me feel anxious and worried about what the outcome will be. 
0.166700	I get anxious about an appointment if it has anything to do with my children or labs pertaining to certain diseases that have a high tendency to run in my family. I'm always worried that one day I'll walk into the clinic and be told my heart is going to give out or I have severe diabetes or thyroid issues. I don't like medications and don't want to be placed on anything that I would have to take daily.
0.714300	If I have a condition that suddenly occurred and I cannot find any information about it. I am also worried about high medical bills.
0.738100	I get anxious about possibly hearing bad news about my health. I also get embarrassed about getting undressed. The results of my lab work makes me apprenhensive.
0.642900	Sometimes I worry I may get bad news about my health. I feel generally healthy but I know that cancer is something that can effect anyone at any level of health. The older I get the more I worry I may not be as healthy as I think I am.
0.261900	I guess the one thing that most patients feel, including myself, is concern about the unknown. I think it is just human nature and conditioning that make me a little anxious. I have noticed that there have been times when my blood pressure would be slightly elevated upon my arrival at my physician's office, but my blood pressure returns to normal before I leave his office. 
0.285700	"When visiting a doctor's office, the thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried is the wait between the time that I check in and the time the doctor actually can see me and uncertainty regarding how much the visit is going to cost financially. Primarily the anxiety I feel is induced by whatever ailment I am experiencing and it typically turns into both anxiety and relief....anxiety over what the doctor might diagnose (for instance, it could be the worst case scenario...though likely not) and relief knowing that someone will be able to give his/her professional opinion and action can be taken. However, for the most part, going to the doctor's office isn't anxiety inducing....just whatever symptoms I am experiencing and the possible cost to ""fix"" it. On a side note, I typically don't go to the doctor unless I am extremely concerned about whatever is ailing my body. "
0.619000	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I perceive that something during the appointment will cause me physical pain.
0.500000	I have a few health problems and I get a little anxious when I know that I have not followed the Doctors as I should have. 
0.238100	Probably just wondering how much it's going to cost. Everyone knows that doctors don't traditionally communicate prices before anything is said and done. Plus you pay a copay as soon as you walk in so you're kind of locked into being there anyway. I also start to worry that whatever I'm visiting for doesn't become a senseless come back again tomorrow or in 3 days so I can charge you for some more arbitrary services. Healthcare cost is so inflated and so many people are in the dark because it benefits the guys mailing out the huge bills.
0.738100	That they will try and find something wrong so they can charge you for tests that you don't need. That they will misdiagnose something and cause me stress.
0.214300	I always worry before my annual PCP visit that maybe my health might be taking a downturn, because every visit prior he tells me I have perfect labwork and everything else. I just want to have A+ health every time.
0.881000	Visiting the doctor makes me feel anxious, and this is obvious when my blood pressure is much higher than normal when taken by health professionals.  My doctor works with me on this matter, and trusts me to report my self-test blood pressure readings. I think there are always unknowns when going to the doctor. You may think you are fine, but the doctor might find something to prove otherwise. I dread getting blood drawn because it is painful. You never know how experienced the person taking your blood is going to be (i.e. they might miss the vein a few times and poke you).
0.309500	When I visit the doctor's office I am most concerned about my weight and blood pressure.  My family has a history of heart problems and I want to stay ahead of the pack and avoid those issues.  I'm doing pretty well so far.
0.142900	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is his eagerness to prescribed drugs as a solution to most problems.

0.142900	I very rarely experience any anxiety while at the doctor The only time was when I was dealing with new health issues and they kept telling they didn't know what was going on. That bothered me as having an answer would give me peace of mind regarding the seriousness of the issue.

0.190500	I typically don't feel anxious or worried. There have been a couple of times when the symptoms I was experiencing could have been caused by a more serious issue. Fortunately, after testing that was not the case. In those instanced I did feel a bit anxious and worried because what could have been going on had a chance to be serious. Thankfully, it was not. 
0.595200	They could misdiagnosis because it could make the situation worst. A large number of the lawsuits come from misdiagnosis and some people have died because of it. 
0.404800	Everything makes me anxious. i am naturally this way but my doctor that I am currently seeing is very sensitive to this and makes me feel pretty comfortable. She has a sweet and caring demeanor and is confident in what she knows. 
0.571400	Forgetting to mention something that might affect diagnosis or forgetting to mention a problem that bothers me.
0.571400	"I would feel the most anxious or worried if the doctor found something wrong or is requesting extra tests or if they specifically say that there is something wrong or something that i need to ""keep an eye on"" or ""monitor"". Those are usually signs of things that either already are problems or have a good likelihood to become problems."
0.500000	I usually only go to the Dr. when something bad is going on or for a physical, so when my level of worry is already heightened by the stress of what ever is ailing me and compelling me to go. 
0.928600	What they might find makes me feel most anxious. You might feel good but when you go to the doctor, you might discover that you have something wrong with you whether it's a disease or low vitamin levels.

0.380952	Before USANA, there was Gull Laboratories. Dr. Wentz spent 20 years developing medical diagnostic test kits designed to detect infections and certain autoimmune disorders. In his experience, Dr. Wentz led to a heightened awareness of the importance of optimal nutrition in maintaining the health of human cells. This awareness, and the clear lack of advanced nutritional support in the market led to the sale of Gull Laboratories and the beginning of a new organization. In 1992, USANA was born. USANA offers its products to customers through a process called direct selling. Direct selling is a little different from what youâre probably used to seeing. Instead of selling our products at the grocery store, products are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers. You may ask why our business is set up this way, and the answer is centered on opportunity. USANA has always been about more than simply selling the best wellness products in the world to great peopleâwe wanted to give people the best opportunity to make their life the most successful it can be. Meaning we want people to be happy and healthy physically as well as financially. We use direct selling with the intention to help people get what they really want: freedom. Freedom to do what they want and when they want. The direct selling opportunity may not be for everyone on this planet, and thatâs OK. It doesnât need to be. We donât profess to have a quick âget richâ plan, or to have the âonly wayâ to earn a living. But we do claim the ability to give people another option to build wealth and establish financial stability, especially when they already love our product and are seeing great results.

0.571429	What usually bothers me is the long wait for a meeting that will probably produce nothing of value to me but does provide income for the doctor.

0.309524	I worry that something is seriously wrong and by the time my Dr. finally decides to take me serious it will be too late
0.142857	I do not have any problem with my visit to my doctors, they do there job and give me what I need and I go on my way.
0.666667	That they will find something wrong with me that is very serious, or that I won't be able to afford to take care of, or that the something won't be covered by insurance.  I think the latter 2 reasons are somewhat unlikely.

0.857143	The appointment is rushed through like they have a fire in their pants. It is cold in the second waiting room and the seating is uncomfortable. If I am sick ,which is usually the case, I just want to be at home in my bed with warm covers over my body Being sick and/or in pain is not a condition I want uno have. I just want to go home to my own software bed with a cup of hot tea. I get more relief from staying comfortable in my own home then going outside in the cold, driving my car to said appointment, finding a parking place(even though I have a disable placard there never is enough parking in the very full parking lot, waiting an uncalled for  amount of time waiting and going to a pharmacy to pick up a medicine and getting back home. Ick!!!!!!!

0.833333	having to undress and wondering if the doctor will find something wrong and also I don't have insurance so I would have to pay the full amount out of my pocket with my husband's money since I don't have a job
0.428571	when i am waiting for test results. I do not know if it is good or bad. I want to educate myself and make sure the best desion is made

0.285714	"Until recently it was the worry that I would be frog-marched through another hideous colonoscopy ordeal.  Thanks be to God, it has recently been decided (and the doc concurs) that, absent specific symptoms, those my age and older can skip ""routine"" colonoscopy due to cost-benefit evaluation and in light of the difficult/increasing physical burden posed on the aging by rigorous draining preparation.  Having fainted (alone) last time around, still poorly prepped and getting a clean bill of colon health, the specialist'd already told me this but my primary care doctor was going strictly by the number of years since the last such ordeal."
0.619048	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is lack of communication.  For example, if you are waiting in the waiting room or exam room and nobody (nurse or doctor) communicates that there will be a delay or explain why there's a delay.  Overall, the most anxious I feel is any lack of communication from the medical person.
0.214286	The final cost of the bill I'm going to be receiving from the doctor. Doctors charge way too much for visits, I think so.

0.285714	I already answered a question just like this. I do not like repeating myself. My only worry is that my doctor doesn't listen to me and doesn't take the time to really get to know me. I am just another face in her practice.
0.238095	Not knowing what they might find. Worrying something might be wrong that I don't know of. as I get older there is a chance that I might have a condition that I need to take a medication for.

0.976190	Life and all the problems that are surrounding me.  I have no power to make them stop cause I'm financially stuck at a place that I put myself in. I don't have family or trustworthy friends. Life is hard and I feel like there is no way out.

I was so anxious that I had to take an extra clonapen that is part of the instruction that my other doctor ordered to me. Than I think that is when the worried feeling comes in.  He explains very slowly and clearly to where I am able to understand what my future holds for me.  He always keeps the door open for any problems.

0.714286	Taking off my clothes and having a check up makes me anxious and worried. I do not like a doctor that does not listen and hurries through the appointment so he or she can go on to the next patient. It makes me anxious when the doctor does not take time with me. I ask alot of questions.

0.714286	Most things caused me a certain degree of anxiety on a daily basis, for I possess generalized anxiety and cope with this as I best can each day.
0.619048	I guess it is the fear that the doctor will find something wrong with me that I was not aware of which would be very upsetting.  Also not knowing the outcome of a diagnosis would worry me too.
0.428571	To know what the doctor will tell me, if it is a bad thing, if it is a treatment, if it is an operation, a rehabilitation, or if it is not bad
0.142857	I am NOT anxious or worried when going to the doctor!  I do not know why this applies to me. I did not put that in my questionnaire.
0.476190	In the past I have rarely been sick, and when I was sick and needed a doctor I could always get better and resume my daily life.  Now as I am aging with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Scoliosis, I not only need to learn to deal with the fact that it may take longer to heal but with the fact that there are some things like Fibromyalgia that you may not recover from (i.e., there is no ready made healing potion).

0.761905	I don't like talking or being around people so it's very stressful to have to come in contact with so many people and to go outside. It's also invasive to be examined and to ask questions, and it's hard to give complete answers.
0.809524	im afraid i will get bad news or i will have too get a shot that makes me very anxious other then that i trust my doctor 
0.285714	This is tough since I am so comfortable going to the doctor.  I am only anxious or worried if the result keeps me out of work for any period of time.  The office is clean and cheery.  The office staff is always friendly.  I know everyone by name.  The cost of a visit has gone up dramatically so I suppose that makes me anxious.  I do worry that I might not be able to afford prescriptions since they also have gone up.  It seems like my paycheck is going for a higher rate of medical things.  I stopped buying anything that isn't an absolute necessity.
0.142857	I don't worried about nothing but my health and to get my medicine and make sure I make it home after everything is done
0.666667	I'm afraid I may be sick and he may not be able to help me or I may not be able to afford the care I need and he will not help me because of these reasons

0.833333	At first I feel nervous, but fortunately I have to trust, because this should be, otherwise everything normal, and why not ?, we can only trust
0.547619	Not much only long test and procedures that require you not eat or drink for 24 hours...snd I'm not a fan of needles...when having blood drawn
0.714286	I feel most anxious and worried is when I am in the waiting room and it is taking a long time for me to see the doctor. It just builds up and I feel uncertain as to what the doctor is going to tell me. 
0.142857	If my doctor calls me and tell me she need to see me regarding my test result I feel that it is not good news . Most times this is not so she just wants to go over the results with. Me 
0.309524	being told that I have to have more medication as i prefer to be working to a goal of not having to take medication

I have no use for those type of physicians and will not go back but look for another one.

0.142857	As a diabetic I'm always concerned about the A1C level and that I'm doing the right things. Every day is hard with knowing what, when, and how much to eat. It's a constant struggle.

0.690476	I'm worried they will find something worse than the problem I went in for. You go in thinking something may be fixed with medication then could find out it's really a life altering condition.
0.214286	Because i am not used to doing health esams very often, among other things of minor importance..........
0.357143	The possibility of requiring treatment or finding something wrong that requires expensive long term care that changes my life for the worse

0.571429	I don't care for doctors or emergency rooms that's what makes me anxious.  I waste my time.  The reason why I get anxious and worried is because of my experience with a majority of doctors, urgent care, and emergency rooms.  I had surgery for a hystertomy, got staph, had 4 doctors visits including urgent care, and ER, went in shock and no one would believe me until a nurse at the ER had tested me after I left the ER.  My GYN said it was pop, my primary doctor completely ignored me after I told her don't look at the paper results look at me, the Urgent care said to take an extra high blood pressure bill, and the ER doctor had me touching my nose with my finger and diagnosed with urinary infection i had no symptoms for.  I suffer to this day and yes I still get hairbrained answers like to go check my eyes for the brain fog.  So that is why I get anxious.  Finally I did get a good learning urologist who performed the other half of my surgery for a urinary band who saw how sick I was and she saved my life from the staph infection after weeks of begging someone to listen that I felt like death.

0.285714	That he's going to scold me for still living with my boyfriend...someone he doesn't trust and doesn't think is good for me.  He's also probably going to tell me I need to stop worrying about others and to start taking care of myself.

I'm there becuase I have a legetiment issue with my body or mind, and don't know where else to go. But what they see is a poor, druggie looking to get another hit of their favorit cocktail. They see a ""ignorant hick"" that is incapable of processing complex information such as personal heath. They don't see an individual. They either see an issue they don't want to deal with, or a nice little bonus paycheck. The prior dismiss all my problems stating, ""it's nothing to worry about becuase I (the doctor) don't know at it is,"" the later stating, ""well, I see that Medicaid will pay for these sixteen different tests, let's do them all! (when none of them are nessesary)."" They lie, cheat, and steal like everyone else with power and money.
