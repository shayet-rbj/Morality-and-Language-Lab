0.627800	I feel like I can understand it at a limited level. If I have questions I usually ask or I take my mom who is a retired nurse and she explains it. 
0.838900	I feel like I'm more than capable of understanding basic health information. If I don't understand some parts, I ask my doctor to explain in normal terms. If I'm still confused on it, I go home and study it.
0.733300	I can ask questions/ use the internet if I don't understand something. I don't feel like I don't have the ability to find things about my health.
0.866700	I think I can understand most of what is happening when I go if I don't then I ask the doctor or call them.
0.583300	I have had to deal with hospitals in the past due to my father dying of lung cancer. So I had to deal with a lot of forms, documents, and medical speak. So I have experience dealing with them.
0.622200	Some of it is fine, but most is very hard to understand
0.872200	In person, I sometimes have issues because I'm not always able to process all the details. But after the fact, as long as I have a written summary, I can always look up what I need to, ask follow-up questions, call or email or contact people otherwise to get the information I'm looking for.
0.694400	I fell I have quite a bit of understanding in regards to the human body and its health. 
0.394400	The drs just kind of talk over me and make it hard to know what they are talking about. they quote numbers of this and cognitive that and things that I don't understand. I sometimes have my mom to help me but we are just simple folk who don't know what they mean most of the time. it's frustrating
0.672200	Honestly, a lot of times doctors and nurses use words that are too big for me to understand.  Sometimes I am able to understand what they are saying but I would say for the most part I am not able to understand much of what they are telling me.
0.916700	I have a very good ability to do this.  I'm well educated, plus my wife used to work in the field.
0.794400	I think I can process and understand basic health information.  My parents have had a lot of health issues, so I grew up learning a lot about hospitals.
0.888900	I am already a medical student. I have extensive experience understanding more than just basic health information. I am trained to do so.
0.888900	I feel like I have the full capacity to understand health information and the services needed to make decisions.

0.766700	I have a decent capacity to obtain and understand basic health information. sometimes the technical jargon gets to be a bit confusing.
0.827800	I feel very good about this, but I need help sometimes. There are some medical terms I do know a lot about.
0.900000	I believe about 90%. I have worked in a medical field for quite some time so I feel a bit more prepared than many. However it always seems more daunting when you're on the other side.
0.777800	I think overall I am able to understand the process. But if something rare comes out up, or it could be a variety of different possibilities that need to be tested for, it can be difficult to keep all the info straight. 
0.916700	I know I can. if I have questions I will ask for more understanding
0.916700	I think I can understand most if not all medical information presented to me and if I had questions I am confident I know who and how to ask.
0.883300	In general, I have the capacity I need to make appropriate health decisions. I have resources available to obtain further information and the general knowledge to process it.
0.900000	I always ask questions if I am confused about something. If there are questions I forgot to ask, I go online and search for the answers on Google. I am always able to find enough information to understand what is going on with my health.

0.811100	I am very confident.
0.733300	I feel confident in my ability to read, understand and ask necessary questions.  I am comfortable with the reading skills and my listening and comprehension skills.
0.900000	I have an extremely good ability to process this sort of information. I have advanced degrees and process more complication information routinely.
0.888900	I feel like I do. I have learned through the years to be very direct with people in the medical profession. I frankly don't trust anyone but the doctors and the nurses, and they start out as suspect. Any civilian working for the hospital is to be treated with zero trust whatsoever.
0.744400	I do understand all of the basics. When a doctor goes into detail, sometimes I have a hard time understanding. I always ask questions to clarify if I do not understand. 
0.850000	I have been filling out health related information for a long time. Not only for myself but my husband, children, and siblings. I know to ask about what I do not understand because it could be reason for a misdiagnosis
0.611100	I feel that I'm a smart person.  My mind is sharp but at the same time doctors and nurses are sometimes so vague and trying to just wrap up the appointment so they can get their money that I just go along with it
0.750000	I think I have a great capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I know my body well and I do my own research so I don't have to rely just on my doctor's lone opinion. 
0.916700	I can the capacity to learn anything I need to learn, process, and understand. Whether I fully understand or not it's my right to make decisions on my body whether I want to take something or have a surgery or not but it wouldn't be for a lack of understanding what's going on. 
0.527800	I have some ability to gain access to the basic health information I need, however most doctors make things vague or do not know enough about my own health to advise me. I feel like most doctors look for the easiest answer possible and then go with that, explaining the bare minimum about how to take care of myself after this.
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable to do this.  I am a reasobly intelligent adult so I have the ability to understand things and to ask questions if I do not understand something
0.916700	I have everything I need to fill out information and explain and understand medical situations
0.777800	Very well. If it's broken down in layman's terms I understand
0.872200	I feel I can process and understand health information with ease. I've yet to have any significant difficulty. 
0.705600	Yes, I do, however, I don't think Doctors care so much anymore. My grandfather was a radiologist. In those days everyone had a good Doctor and they could afford to see him. My grandfather says his father was a doctor in the depression. People paid him with chickens, eggs and milk. I think barter might be a better way to have a doctor. Now when you say you have no insurance or state insurance they won't even make an appointment to see you.
0.916700	I feel confident about my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. This leads to confidence in making appropriate health decisions. 
0.888900	It's really not me... it's the doctors. I'm sure you've seen that they have 20min, 15min, even 10min appointments... they don't give you enough time to process what they say, to allow you to form questions. 
0.916700	With my background in medical terminology, I have no problems.

0.872200	Overall I feel that I can obtain and understand basic health information. I can get the information I need out of them, and in writing. I also am able to follow up on that information with my own research. I am also able to make appropriate choices based upon this material. 
0.872200	I believe I can grasp the information I need about my health and if I have a question I don't hesitate to ask for clarity and especially in writing.
0.872200	I have great confidences that I can process health information. If anything is unclear I will simply ask about it to make sure its clear.

0.805600	I feel I have a good amount of knowledge. Im not afraid to ask questions and often times I will ask too many questions. This allows me to make I understand. I have trusted doctors to turn to
0.516700	I feel that I have the ability to obtain it, but I have less of an ability to process and understand it. There have been many times when I've wondered what a medicine was supposed to be doing for me, or times when I struggled to fill out forms (about myself!). I think there should be guides for some of these things.
0.866700	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because I have a degree in English Language Arts.
0.644400	I feel I am capable but sometimes need help filling out forms.  I often forget the minor details of things and my wife always remembers.
0.883300	I feel that I have a good understanding of what is being said to me by a doctor or nurse, but I have a difficult time trusting them.
0.461100	I think it is hard because there are so many different factors and what if this choice isn't the best one you don't really know all the health information to make an informed decision
0.794400	i feel like i am able to understand all the info that is given to me. I have the knowledge and ability to understand and use this info to help me
0.866700	I feel I have a healthy capacity to understand health information provided to me or asked of me in medical settings.
0.566700	i feel like i have a pretty good understanding but there have been multiple times when i need help or i am confused. Some forms are hard to figure out and to understand what the form is looking for.
0.850000	I feel fully confident. I am young and proficient in English and paperwork matters. I also work in healthcare.
0.616700	No, I often have to visit several doctors and have several opinions paired with research of my own to make my own health decisions. In my experience, many doctors aren't as helpful as I'd like them to be.
0.688900	I feel for the most part I either understand the material or think that I can look up the information that I don't understand.  I feel that I have good judgment for the most part and probably make wise decisions regarding my health, and would if I needed to.
0.594400	I think I can comprehend most of it. There are some big words I don't understand which I usually try to get help with. It it usually easy to understand when someone else explains it
0.888900	I have the capacity to understand and process health information.  I've never needed help.  If I don't understand, I will ask the doctor, nurse or Google it.
0.755600	"I feel I have the capacity to do these things but I don't always have the resources or the confidence to do them. So, it isn't a certainty that I can find a specialist who can provide me the ""right"" answers to my questions. I don't always ask enough follow-up questions, in my opinion, as I don't want to take up too much of the health provider's time."
0.850000	I can obtain and process all basic health information without assistance. If I have any questions I am always sure to ask, and seek clarification until I am sure I understand what I am being told.
0.900000	my doctor has a health portal that i can log into to get info on my meds, conditions and I can contact my doctor through it.
0.588900	I have training in in health field and I used to work in the hospital. I feel comfortable to help. 
0.850000	To the highest degree I feel that I am capable of processing and understanding basic health information simply because I have family who has worked in the medical field. They have always told me that I should ask and answer questions with honesty because what I do may affect their plans for me such as medication or therapy. 
0.888900	I believe I unstand biology and science well enough to communciate with medical professiols.

0.783300	I am very capable of understanding and reading health information, wether from a nurse practitioner, M.D. or specialist. If anything ever sounds confusing I am not ashamed to ask for detailed information regarding the issue. 
0.600000	I feel like I'm about average in comparison to others when it comes to comprehending health information. There are some things that may go over my head but I do not hesitate to get things answered if needed. I feel as if I'm competent enough to do most.

0.722200	I think that I have the capacity to understand and make appropriate health decisions. I have wonderful doctors that I have chosen for the most part. Sometimes I just have to be sure to ask all the questions that I have. I have to learn that they cannot read my mind.
0.633300	Sometimes I do. When they start giving probabilities and percentages, I start to lose them though. I prefer black and white explations. 
0.822200	I'm coherent and somewhat intelligent. I feel I have the tools to make appropriate decisions about my health.
0.833300	I believe that I have the capacity to understand health information. I rarely need clarification on health terms and feel I have a good grasp of basic health information.

0.833300	I am intelligent. I am also skeptical of authorities. I do things on my own.
0.827800	I think I have the adequate amount of expertise for it. If i am not sure about something I usually look it up online.

0.666700	I have a good capacity to obtain information because I have past experience in the medical field and I know where to look. Sometimes, the information seems technical and I would prefer conditions and medications were explained in layman's terms. If I have enough time, I can alyze the date given to me and find satisfactory information in it.
0.783300	To a moderate extent. I feel like all of the information is available if I know what to ask or look for, but I don't always know what to ask. 
0.655600	I have a pretty good capacity. I make sure to read closely all materials given to me. I also make sure to ask lots of questions to make sure I am making the right decisions. I also research on the internet to make sure I understand.
0.577800	I have an okay time with it all. Not the best but I try and see things through.

0.916700	I think that I can understand the information pretty well, I've never needed help filling out forms or anything regarding healthcare before.  The only time I've been confused about something was when I got insurance (for the first time) and wasn't sure where to put the information on a form.
0.872200	I believe I'm capable in all of the above matters. I can comprehend all needed information provided from my health service provider. If I happen to be confused on any aspect of it, I will ask them to clarify. Overall, I'd say I'm totally able to fathom, interpret, and use all given information.
0.816700	I think that I would, somewhat competently. I would probably need a little help parsing written information and organizing it all in my help, but I'd probably be able to do most of it myself.
0.766700	I feel like I can understand 90% of what is being told and explain.  One in a while  I have NO IDEA what they are talking about.  
0.855600	I'm pretty confident I have the ability to ascertain what is going on.  I will usually ask if I don't understand something fully.  My doctors have been pretty good in explaining everything thoroughly though anyways.
0.766700	I have the capacity to make most of the informed medical decisions by myself. I can understand almost all of the medical information provided by my doctor(s). If there is something that I don't understand I ask questions for further clarification.
0.850000	I am extremely confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I often assess health related needs and review basic symptoms and treatments to ensure I am taking the appropriate actions. This could be in relation to physical injuries or interl medicine.
0.594400	A basic level of ability.  The forms and all are confusing at times and sometimes I feel awkward discussing things with a doctor that I don't know that well.  
0.916700	I AM VERY WELL READ AND HAVE NO PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL OR LEGAL FORMS
0.655600	I always feel comfortable when speaking to a medical professiol because they have seen many cases of my case. Whether I have allergies or anxiety, I talk to my doctor and tell him every step of pain or exhaustion I feel. I leave no stone un turned as I want the doctor's trust and help. 
0.916700	I have complete ability to understand all basic health information.
0.477800	Most of that stuff goes over my head. I don't even read it half the time. The United States health care system is designed to screw us over. Who cares if I miss the fine print? It's all the same to me. Nobody cares.
0.916700	I have no issues understanding and dealing with health issues and how to handle them. I am an educated person and have no problems comprehending what my doctors or nurses tell me.
0.688900	I have a basic understanding, however it does not mean I think the process is easy, or understandable by any means.
0.900000	I am completely capable. I grew up with a chronic illness, so I learned to advocate for myself,and ask the right questions.

0.794400	I am confident that I can obtain and understand basic health information and services. I'm more than capable of seeking out information I need, the issue is moreso that I sometimes don't bother to ask.
0.788900	I feel I have the capacity. I think sometimes doctors bowl over patients though. or assume they won't understand information and so don't even try to be complete. 
0.738900	With the power of the internet, I can find most medical information. Understanding it is a bit more difficult but it can be done if I really want to put the time in. 
0.916700	I don't feel like I have any problem getting information and understanding it.  If there are things I don't understand I am comfortable asking for help or gathering further information.
0.688900	I feel like I know most of what I need to know when it comes to health information. When I don't have information I need, I can find someone that is able to help me.
0.844400	The only thing I have issue with is knowing my family history, and my immunization record - if it's really needed, I have to talk to my mom.  But I have excellent reading comprehension, know how to search for and then synthesize information I want, and know my own preferences well enough to be confident in my judgments.
0.783300	I feel good about it. I've also gotten better at asking questions that I need answered in a way that helps me understand better. It's very important that I know what's going on with my body.
0.755600	I don't even understand that statement.  Why do doctors go to school for 10 years to learn all this jargon and I'm supposed to understand it with nothing
0.494400	I feel like if I asked more questions and did more research I would be better informed but I put off both as]king questions and doing research for later and then never actually do it, so ivery often don't know the proper info about the prescription meds I'm taking and what I can't and can't take with them.I know the info is all out there but I just get too flustered to do anything about it. 
0.883300	I feel that I am willing to admit when I need help understanding something from my doctor.  If I am unsure of what is being discussed, read, or asked about, I will seek out a source to clarify my confusion.
0.816700	I feel like I'm pretty able to research health information as it pertains to me and my children.  I am one of those people that will obsessively research something if I find out I have it and then be able to ask my practitioner the correct questions.
0.888900	I have a higher capacity than the general population but not as much as a healthcare professiol of any sort (nurses, MA, doctors, etc) because my son was in the hospital for a time and I have to help my mom understand forms about her and my grandmother. I know the questions to ask.
0.900000	I feel like I know what I'm doing when it comes to this. I try to stay informed and know what is important to ask and be aware of. I don't tend to shy away from asking questions and getting information.
0.883300	I have the capacity to obtain and process any basic health information I require. If I don't understand something, I ask questions of the relevant health professiol until I do, or I google it. I can easily search out answers online.
0.838900	I work at a hospital so I am exposed to a lot more lingo/ terminology than others so I have a better grasp and understanding.
0.705600	I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I am usually hesitant about health related things and I like to double check my information and sources to make sure I am doing everything the right way. 
0.722200	For the most part I feel like the information is available. But often the medical staff or doctor is rushed and they seem impatient and rushed.
0.622200	im pretty confident i can handle it myself 
0.805600	I feel like I can understand basic health information. The only problem I would have is with technical terms related to the medical field. 
0.916700	I feel very confident that I have to capacity to understand basic health information. It is my health, after all, and I refuse to not have any and all information regarding any medical situations.
0.722200	I am pretty compentant at understanding what a lot of the words mean, but sometimes it is hard to understand certain implications of different aspects of my health.  I think it is better when a doctor can beak it down into terms more relateable rather than heavily coded in medical and scientific jargon  
0.916700	I feel fine with it.  100% capable of doing what it takes to mage my healthcare- both asking and receiving all medical information. 
0.761100	I can understand most of the information but sometimes the way it is phrased or written leaves me feeling confused or lost. In the past I have struggled with reading some details. Sometimes I have just skimmed the material and signed even when I don't understand it.
0.855600	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I research online or talk to trusted friends/family who are knowledgable in healthcare in order to ask the right questions.
0.761100	I can always understand basic health information but I have a problem processing it while I am with the doctor or nurse.  It takes me a little time to think of the questions I want to ask and by then, I am already home and it is too late to call.  I feel like doctors and nurses can talk too fast and get you out of the office too quickly at times.
0.827800	I do feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information.  There might be times when I feel uncomfortable asking follow up questions or forget or don't think to ask something when I am in the office with the nurse/doctor
0.594400	I believe I do have the ability to access the information but often it comes from outside sources. I often feel rushed or intimidated by my medical staff and do not speak up to ask the proper questions, or I become so overwhelmed by the dismissive or hurried mood they have that I sit quietly instead of taking up more of their time.  Sometimes things don't make sense and I am too passive to speak up and say anything, and then often have to research it at home myself, which leaves me wondering if I am finding the correct information or not. 
0.866700	I understand it for the most part. Sometimes I do not understand what certain words mean, but usually can find a definition online or ask someone who is in the medical profession. I feel like I have pretty good access due to my insurance.
0.883300	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have no trouble with this. 
0.677800	I feel that I have a basic understanding generally of what the doctor or nurse is telling me. Sometimes I misunderstand what they are saying, or take the information out of context and miss vital information. When I get confused I feel kind of stupid and rarely ask for clarification.
0.744400	I think that I understand basic health information when its given by health care professiols. Sometimes I can forget things related to nutrition after I am told, but for the most part I think I have a pretty good grasp on this type of information. 
0.883300	I would ask questions to the doctor about anything I didn't understand until I was satisfied that I knew what they where telling me.
0.627800	I feel I am knowledgeable enough to understand basic health information, but when large terms start being used I sometimes get confused. 
0.838900	I think I pretty much have a good handle on understanding things, as well as seeking out reliable sources for information. As an example, when I was diagnosed as being BRCA1+, the oncologist said to me something like she didn't think she could tell me anything I didn't already know.

0.538900	i do not feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision because it is impossible to see a doctor these days. Moreover, once you actually see a doctor, they charge you out the wazoo. So there's this incentive not to go see a doctor. If i can't see a doctor, because i can't afford it. Then it's impossible to obtain/process/understand basic health information. Health care in the US is so broken. And trump is making it worse.
0.538900	It all depends on the circumstances. Some things are just harder than others to understand. I don't like doctors to begin with, they seem to cause a denial for me if something is wrong.
0.861100	I think I have an average degree of capacity in these areas.  I understand all forms and am able to fill them out.  I do hesitate to ask some questions of the doctor at times but I am able to look up information online instead.

Understanding a medical bill should be a basic decency in medicine.

0.811100	I have strong capacity to understand what I'm being told, but I often lack the confidence to ask appropriate questions, thinking that they're either silly questions or that I already understand the information.

My wife is also there to answer questions and process information, though she is similar to me in that it takes some time to process questions.
0.527800	I think I am generally capable of making decisions on my basic health information because if there is something that I don't understand I ask my doctor and she will explain it to me.

0.694400	I feel like sometimes I get a little overwhelmed and I either forget to ask pertinent questions or I don't quite understand what's happening, so I pick out the things I think are important and try to understand those. Sometimes this results in me missing important things.

Still, there are many terms and things that I am not aware of today and can always use the help/guidance of professiols in explaining some of these current health issues today.  It never hurts to get more information I feel.
0.872200	I speak English fluently and am intelligent and have common sense. I understand or will ask questions about most things doctors/nurses tell me. I also have a child so I am responsible for his health as well as my own and am confident I can use and understand our health care services.

0.900000	I have a lot of potential to understand all the information i need
0.800000	I feel pretty competent in understanding basic health information and services. I make all of my health decisions on my own, and rarely need help.

0.650000	I feel mostly confident in my ability to understand basic health information and all the decisions that go with it. My hesitancy so say I am 100% confident stems strictly from medical confusion I get from time to time. In the medical profession now there are so many differing opinions that anything more than one source (doctor) is involved, explations become a little jumbled in my mind because of their differing views. I think this sometimes inhibits my ability to make faster and firm decisions about my health.
0.916700	I have total capacity and understanding of health related matters and services and need no one to help me with making decisions. I am a fully functioning and sane adult that can make decisions for myself. 
0.661100	I do not have health insurance, therefore I have to go to a clinic in which I feel they do not give the care that is necessary. I try to ask the questions I need to but they are busy so they really just want you out the door. I don't have much of an idea how to get assistance.
0.916700	I have family in the medical field, so I grew up with a bare if not necessarily educated understanding of the health sciences. So I've never really had any trouble comprehending physicians have told me.
0.916700	I believe I can understand the majority of health information to make decisions. I have a degree in Nursing so medical terminology is not confusing to me.

0.900000	I feel I understand most information and easily know how to find what I don't know about. I am a pharmacist so I have access to great resources for what I need to learn.
0.788900	I feel confident in my ability to understand most information presented, but I do sometimes avoid asking questions out of shyness and a fear of looking dumb. I do have friends I can ask though.

0.916700	I feel that it is very easy for me to get the information I need to understand the health services  and options I am being offered. I have never encountered difficulty understanding what my physician or nurse is saying to me. If I ever need questions answered or clarified I have always received satisfying answers that I can understand.
0.844400	I think this is an issue with non-tive speakers.  I also think uneducated folks may have issues.  Since I was born in the US and finished grad school, I feel pretty confident.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand better than the average person, given my educatiol background. I have a masters degree in biochemistry and molecular biology so I think in a scientific way. I am also interested in the medical field and so I think that helps. 
0.650000	I have had to seek out people to help me make informed medical decisions. A family friend who is a doctor as well as my brother in law who is a malpractice lawyer help me make these decisions. After consulting these people ad well as my assigned doctors and nurses make me feel confident in my decisions. 
0.666700	I feel confident enough to ask my nurse/dr. all the questions I need to understand. I'm also confident in my reading/comprehension skills to understand written information. I know where to find more information online if I need it.
0.866700	I have the assertiveness to make sure a doctor explains what I don't understand. I have the internet aptitude to research medical issues thoroughly. I have the humility to admit when I don't understand something.
0.844400	I think I have an above average ability to understand and process basic health information. This is due to my schooling in the biological sciences, in addition to my mother being a nurse with whom I may ask questions and have her explain the complex medical jargon that I may not understand. I also have the ability to google terms/conditions I do not know about and glean understanding about them from reputable sites.
0.827800	I feel like I am able to gather most of the information I need to make health care decisions for myself.

0.811100	Medical publications are often hard to read and not meant for laymen to process.  I do try to ask questions when I do not understand, but often I do not know that I do not fully understand until I try to explain it to other people.
0.694400	I have ability to understand. Sometimes doctors make things seem complicated on purpose. I understand more easily by doing my own research. 
0.750000	Generally, I feel confident about my ability to obtain and process basic health info. It can be confusing when two different doctors say two different things or even say things in slightly different ways.  Everyone seems to have a different opinion and it can be difficult to ascertain what to follow.  I don't always understand why I am given the prescriptions I am given and if they are really necessary.  
0.838900	I think if the problems and information are simplified to a degree where it is easy enough to understand for someone who did not go to med school, I can understand pretty well all the information given to me. 
0.788900	I feel like I have a good capacity to do so. I fill out the doctor's forms when I go get a physical and I schedule a physical yearly. If anything came up on a physical I'm sure I'd be able to check it out.
0.800000	I feel I could obtain basic health info and services pretty well except for my social anxiety that gets in the way. I am often too shy to call to make an appointment, when I'm in an appointment I often just want it over as fast as possible so I might not bring up all my concerns.
0.916700	I am able to completely understand written and spoken information regarding my health. I am fully able to make health decisions on my own. 
0.616700	I'm often times too shy to ask for help or further explation. However, I also feel that doctors and nurses have a tendency to rush things. I can barely even get my questions in because they just breeze through the appointment like they don't really want to be there or they have other things to be doing. I understand that they are busy, but this gets really frustrating as I almost always leave the office feeling as if there is more I need/want to know.
0.705600	I can understand most basic health information. The more complicated manners I sometimes need some assistance in explaining what the condition is, side effects, and possible treatments.
0.916700	I believe I have this capacity to a high degree. I am a high level reader and can understand information that is directed toward me, whether through reading or listening. I am also willing to ask any questions that will address any issues I am not clear on. 
0.800000	I feel I can handle most things. If I don't understand something, I will ask the doctor or nurse until I figure out what is necessary.
0.900000	I have had a lot of experience with hospital/medical documents so other than medical terms, I feel confident in determining what those documents say. I occasiolly run some medical terminology past a friend who is trained in the medical field but rarely. 
0.738900	I feel alone what confident in knowing medical conditions but sometimes what is explained still doesn't make sense. Also I think of questions to ask after the appointment is already over. Sometimes I feel like doctors make up explations and doing really look into what is going on.
0.544400	Oftentimes information concerning my health can get a bit complex, and I occasiolly need aid from a professiol health professiol to decipher certain things regarding the information.
0.811100	Because both my kids have had surgeries, one has food allergies and my consulting business often works with doctors, I am comfortable asking questions and feeling like I understand the whole picture by the time the office visit is over. I also worked in rehab facilities and was in charge of insurance several years ago, so official forms don't confuse me at all.
0.616700	For the most part, however, sometimes I am not really sure of what they are trying to convey. I usually have my daughter with me so she can ask questions I am not thinking of.
0.655600	I feel my understanding is average. I can understand some things but most need assistance from someone who understands more. I usually prefer an expert in the field to get my info.
0.866700	I think I mostly understand what I read and am told but there is not always an effort to make things easily understandable.

0.861100	Full capacity to understand most anything presented to me. 
0.816700	I feel like I have most of the information I need. I can usually find more specific information, or explations in layman's terms, regarding my health information online.

0.916700	I do feel that I can fill out any forms regarding health and ask doctors/nurses to explain health information so that I completely understand and am able to make decisions.
0.572200	I am somewhat in the middle. I think my problem is I don't know how to ask the right question and don't know how to process the information correctly.

0.772200	I usually am able to follow what I am being told in regards to the medical information given to me, however, there have been times when I needed more information and did not ask for it.

0.666700	If I have the able to google terms I don't understand then I would have no problem. But if I don't I feel stressed  because doctors don't always want to help. 
0.816700	I feel like I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.

This way, I can always be sure that I can make the best decision for my health.
0.772200	While I do believe I can read all the information given to me by medical professiols, It is sometimes difficult to understand exactly what they mean. I also don't know if I'm asking the right questions or what to even ask when I am given new information.

Also, I am sickly, so I fill out paperwork regularly. i see no point in making the medical staff work harder, so I am very forthcoming, and ask lots of questions if something kind of confuses me.
0.838900	As far as I know, I have my full mental capacities. I have a college degree and a masters degree and I've had to take care of family members with their healthcare, so I have a pretty good understanding of the system.
0.811100	I feel very qualified to do this as I was the caregiver for two termil parents and, due to the urgency and obvious passiote interest in their welfare, made a concerted effort to become highly involved in their medical care and procedures. Taking care of someone you love who is ill is like taking a crash course in medicine. And out of necessity, I developed the necessary courage and stami to talk to health care professiols irregardless of their taciturn or uncooperative tures.
0.872200	I feel like I have the means necessary to understand basic health info. I have a background in health services so I feel I am slightly above the curve. I also have a group of friends who are involved in the medical community that I can ask questions if I need to.
0.916700	A very high degree. I'm a college graduate with a degree in jourlism. Not sure what else to say.
0.850000	Yes, I believe I can understand basic health information and make good decisions about them. I search google for information on things I don't understand. It's pretty easy to clarify things through asking dr./nurse questions and the use of google.
0.833300	i have a great capacity for asking and understanding questions and answers i might have for medical information from a dr. i usually google everything first. so i basically know what i have, i tell him. he checks says yup your right. i always carry a list of notes if i need to, like for more complicated situations  
0.850000	I feel like my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information is above average. I say that with full confidence because I have a B.S degree in Health Sciences. This degree covered a broad range of medical terminology, medicil therapies, and chemistry and biological sciences. 
0.811100	I feel like I have an average layman's understanding of health information. I don't think I have more knowledge or anything, but I do think that I can process and understand the information I am given, or information I am searching for sufficiently. Sometimes, though, things are out of my ability to understand, and I will either ask someone who I think is knowledgeable or just look it up myself.
0.888900	I am able to read and understand my medical information.  I can listen to the Doctors and comprehend and set up follow up care. I someitmes forget to mention everything that I am supposed to about my condition to them 
0.811100	I think that I have a decent understanding.  If I don't completely understand it I won't ask a ton of questions because I can turn to Google to look up the information.  Most of the time I do this when they step out of the room.  If looking it up leads me to be confused I will then ask questions when they step back into the room.
0.872200	I have a large capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information when making health-related decisions. I am highly educated. I do find it more difficult to understand more advanced information such as articles from medical jourls (occasiolly provided by my doctor) mostly due to the industry specific language that I am unfamiliar with. 
0.800000	I regularly research online about health problems and conditions so I am fairly knowledgeable on these matters and feel confident in my ability and capacity to obtain, process, and understand this info.
0.716700	I feel I have a good understanding of health information and typically don't require assistance to understand 
0.883300	I think I have full capacity to understand any information I am given.  Even if I don't fully understand I think that I have the capabilities to research it on my own to get a better understanding 
0.855600	I have plenty of access to medical professiols and trusted advisors to obtain, process and understand basic health information as needed. 
0.794400	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information. This, in turn, means I am able to understand basic health information. Because of this, I feel that I have the capacity to understand what I am told by doctors and what is written in medical forms.
0.677800	I feel like I understand stuff about my own health when it's explained to me. I mostly just have issues understanding health insurance. I think they make it complicated on purpose.
0.866700	I think most of the time, I can handle the information. If I am very ill, or uncomfortable, that affects how much attention I can pay to new medical information.I have, in the past, had doctors repeat things as many times as I needed fr me to understand.
0.788900	I feel as though I have the capacity to obtain information, but the part where I may need help most is interpreting the information in a way that I understand it. A medical diagnosis is great, but unless my doctor can explain it to me in a way that I can understand, and also understand everything that accompanies it, then the diagnosis itself is useless to me. In my current health care system, if you speak to enough people, eventually you will be directed to the person who can help answer your question. 
0.777800	I feel I have a good capacity to understand basic health information.  I have had a preexisting condition my entire life and need to be able to understand this type of information.
0.761100	For the most part, I think I can understand most of the information.  If I have any questions, I do ask my doctor or after I can call her or one of the nurses in the office. They will always help me. 
0.883300	I feel that I have a very high capacity at obtaining these things. My doctors and nurses are very helpful and informative, especially if I don't understand something.
0.883300	In the past I have always been able to understand the information that I have been given relating to my medical concerns. I have made good enough decisions and have not had any problems due to my reading comprehension.
0.711100	I think I have an adequate understanding of basic medical terminology to understand 90% of all trips to clinics or the hospital. However, if the terminology gets too technical, I need to get help either from a doctor or a friend help me explain what is going on. Overall, I think I have good capacity to make educated health decisions regarding my health. 
0.900000	Yes I asked the necessary questions if there's anything I don't understand
0.561100	I feel like I'm literate and competent enough to understand things, but I often lack sufficient information because I have too little time face-to-face with a doctor, nurse, or tech.  I feel rushed along and don't feel like it's ok  to ask many questions or to provide very detailed information.
0.638900	It depends on the condition. For instance when I have a cold, medical care is easier to understand than when I am being seen for my thyroid.
0.900000	I believe I can make appropriate health choices. I have worked in healthcare for the last four years, and I actually do administrative work where I review health information forms. I am confident that I understand what I am filling out on my persol health forms.
0.888900	I have good health insurance and therefore have access to the professiol opinions I need to make a decision about my health. I am a young, intelligent professiol and I am able to take the information provided by health care professiols and make the best decision. 
0.794400	I do feel that I can understand most of what is explained to me.  If not, I feel confident that I can find a doctor or nurse to explain what I don't understand.  I can also research issues myself on the internet.
0.883300	I try to get a firm understanding of what's going on. I tell the doctor or nurse everything because I feel it's the one profession you should never lie to. I then listen to what they say and if I have a question I ask it. If I don't understand, I will try to have them explain it further or better. I then get other information on my condition and then I feel I am comfortable making a decision with the information I have received.
0.916700	I fully understand what they tell me and I ask a lot of questions if it is unclear. I will also do significant research on the internet about any medical condition or procedure I may have.
0.844400	I feel confident with obtaining and understanding health information. I have been a caregiver of someone with cancer as well, so I got quite a bit of practice doing so as asking questions was very important. 
0.866700	I feel confident when reading health information and making proper decisions. I am aware of changing medical field and i try to keep myself updated. when ever i need help i am not afraid to ask.
0.916700	I feel that I am knowledgeable enough to about my health and have the ability to effectively relay my health information to health care providers. Also, if  I did need help I know where to get it.

0.816700	I think that with technology now a days its easier to obtain and understand the information provided. 
0.705600	Medical information can be overwhelming, especially when you receive less than positive news. I have a hard time digesting all the information given by doctors and medical professiols and wish there was a better way to capture this info so I could better research at home.
0.733300	I think I am very capable in understanding health information.
0.722200	Im open minded, and feel the need to question things, so I think I can usually dig as deep as i need to
0.794400	I feel confident that I am able to comprehend health information provided by my doctors. If there is anything I don't understand, I feel comfortable asking my healthcare providers for an explation. Availability and ease of communication is one of the things I look for when choosing a doctor. 
0.761100	I feel like I have a good knowledge base to work from.  It is sometimes complex when working with this kind of information, but there are plenty of outlets to help.
0.705600	I can understand basic health information if I have the time to research it, but I often feel that they're rushed and would rather not go into it so I don't ask them. Only in rare cases where it's very important do I ask for clarification then and there.
0.866700	I feel I have the ability process and understand basic health information and services by using the internet. Right now I have insurance so I can obtain information my provider has a free phone number to call to ask medical questions.
0.916700	I have excellent knowledge of the healthcare field.  I am the person to go to when you need help understanding anything involving health.  I am not a Dr. or nurse. 
0.794400	To a good extent. Sometimes the questions on the forms are a bit confusing and it's hard to put down an answer.  They are also repetitive. I am able to ask the doctor questions about information given to me, but often questions do not come up until after the visit. 
0.883300	I have no trouble obtaining and understanding health information, generally. The exception to that is if a doctor starts rattling off scientific medical terminology that I'm not familiar with, or if they reference drug mes I don't know. Reading material isn't an issue because I can always look something up if I don't understand it.
0.733300	I understand written and spoken English very well, but when I encounter a field-specific jargon I am not familiar with it can become difficult. I don't feel like being that tedious patient who wants every word defined like a verbal test from their college days. I do, however, ask for more information when I feel their explation is based on the assumption that I already know something. 
0.916700	I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information about myself and what services I would need to make well thought out, appropriate health decisions for the better of myself. 
0.583300	I know enough to stay healthy by myself most of the time. But I sometimes take medicine. I feel like I'll have to think more about it when I am old.
0.916700	I am confident in my capacity to effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.505600	I have problems thinking of a Way to ask the doctor what I need to know. I have a hard time ezpressi g myself in that manner. I also think doctors give me information to quickly for me to process it. I feel rushed when I'm with a doctor and I don't think the exlain everything thouroghly.
0.794400	I usually try to understand most of the basic things about my condition or diagnosis. I will ask some questions occasiolly. But sometimes if the doctor or nurse seems to be in a hurry, I won't ask everything that I really want to know and end up looking things up on the internet.
0.833300	When given when told about a condition or issue the doctors and nurses give me all the needed information and if I need more I will ask for it in writing or do further research on my own.
0.872200	Due to my employment in health care, I feel that I have a decent grasp of medical terminology and pathology.

However, I do also feel somewhat complacent when being treated and tend to trust what they are doing and not question their decisions.

0.688900	I believe that although the system can be complicated, I am capable of making appropriate health decisions. I can ask for clarification and help with forms and acquire more information about topics and conditions being discussed.
0.850000	Somewhat a little from a doctor. I recently went to see a doctor and their diagnosed wasn't very helpful. They spent less than 5 minutes for a $100 charge. 
0.916700	I am very health conscious, and I am very pro-active about health-related topics. I know a lot of terminology, and I usually have a higher understanding of the information on the forms and on health topics than the nurses. I often have a higher understanding than the doctors on the topics as they relate to lifestyle choices (i.e., food), and have a reasoble level of knowledge about how the various systems in the body work. I am able to understand what the doctor tells me, and I know what I don't know, so I can ask questions on the fly and often come prepared with questions. I usually know enough to begin with to understand the answers, but I certainly don't mind clarifying questions. 
0.855600	If I do have any questions about the information I make sure to ask until I do understand the material.  Otherwise I read over the material and look at it closely until I understand what it says if I did not the first time I read it over.
0.716700	I have the capacity to understand and process basic health information. I typically understand whatever doctors tell me when I or my children are sick, need medications or surgeries.

0.672200	I'm pretty bright and understand a lot, but a lot of times my doctors or nurses don't really explain things to me in detail about my conditions, lab reports, etc. I also forget to ask questions or clarify things when I am there sometimes, because I tend to get nervous. They're always rushing too so it's not like you get a ton of time.
0.761100	I would say I am able to understand these things the same as anyone else, there is people doing their jobs all over so plenty of people to talk to.
0.844400	I feel that I'm knowledgeable to understand and talk about ay medical issue that I may have efficiently.

0.872200	I have a high level of reading comprehension so I am very confident that I can understand any information that is given to me.
0.855600	I feel that I have all the ability I need to do this. I am able to go to doctors offices, fill out the forms and ask the quesitions that need to be asked by myself. I understand the things that they tell me, but if I don't I make sure I ask questions until I do.
0.605600	I can find a good amount of the information I need regarding basic health information and services, though there are times when I am not able to find it. There was once a time when I needed information on why I was bleeding in between periods and to an extent it was helpful but then there was contradictory information and some information was unclear. I ended up asking my doctor directly and he explained it just fine. There was another time I needed to find out if my insurance covers a test I needed and no one could tell me. I called the health insurance company, I am not kidding, they did not know the answer. But for the most part, it's easy to obtain most answers to my health questions and to understand what I am being told.

0.827800	I do have some background (college, scribe/EMT experience) in medical language and knowledge that helps me understand at least the basics of conditions that may affect me. Likewise, I feel like I am able to critically read relevant informatiol materials and interact with health professiols to address unswered questions.
0.883300	I think I do. I think I can understand and obtain basic health information. It's not too much of a problem.

0.883300	i can read, if i dont understand i always ask for more information
0.850000	I have always filled out my own medical forms and the forms for my children when they were younger. I have been making insurance claims for well over 40 years as well. Yes, there are some medical terms that I don't initially understand but I'm the one paying for the medical service so I make sure to be assertive when I have to to get the information I need.
0.783300	I feel even though my mom never took me to doctors, unless the schools made her, that I have a fair understanding of medical information.

I feel that most people do not understand everything they are told when seeking medical advice and that medical professiols are happy to explain it when asked. 
0.761100	The internet has made it easier to look up information about many minor health conditions.

0.883300	I feel that I am quite able to handle the processing of the information given to me. That makes me feel good about the choices that I have to make with my health and needed treatments. 
0.883300	I feel my capacity is fine - I'm fortute enough to have a lot of formal education including a background in biological science, so it's not a problem for me generally. Also, my father has had serious health problems most of my life, and I've spent a lot of time in hospitals and dealing with cardiology/diabetic/etc terms - I'm more familiar with them than I would like. 
0.833300	I am able to understand most documentation I am given, and I have the knowledge and experience to find any information or get any questions I have answered.
0.855600	I feel like I am capable of taking control of my health decisions given the right explation of questions I might have.

0.661100	At times I feel that the abbreviations on medical forms are what really mess me up.  Sometimes it takes time to really evaluate what the abbreviations mean, but I usually have the ability to figure it out, if not as my mother who works in the medical field.

0.766700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain and understand health information. I am very shy and sometimes do not ask questions of health personnel that I sometimes should, but if it were absolutely a necessity I would be more than willing to ask these important questions. I usually take what is given me and process it and do extra research myself if necessary.
0.833300	I am perfectly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding health information. My only issue is that I may not ask appropriate questions at times or withhold information that I don't think is relevant. 
0.761100	I feel I have a pretty decent understanding of most health information and services. More complicated services, insurance, and health information I may need to ask someone who I know is more familiar with health services. But the basics I understand pretty well.
0.688900	I could process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions quite easily.Sometimes I asked for help. But not always.
0.655600	I feel that I have an average capacity.

0.822200	I feel like I have the basic understanding that is needed when seeking health attention or to make health decisions.

0.572200	I feel like I have a really hard understand a lot of the health information and services. They use a lot of medical terms that I'm just not familiar with at all, and I  have a pretty difficult time compregending them.I also have a hard time finding out where to get this information, or who to talk to, or how to get something specific done. A lot of the time I just don't know where to look.
0.850000	I listen to whatever my doctor recommends. I feel like I understand everything most of the time, but if i need help they always explain it so I understand.

0.777800	I feel like I have the tools available to understand what I need to know, however those tools are not always connected. For instance, when I am with the dr. I do not always think of the question I need to ask. When the dr gives me information to read at home, the questions prompted would be better asked in the office. When I look up information on-line, I rarely print the information to take in and discuss. 
0.916700	I feel like I have a good understanding of health and health related issues due to my college education which required me to take many classes in biology and other sciences, including atomy and medical terminology.

0.811100	I have a relatively high level of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.

I can always ask a family member in the health care industry when I don't understand something or do research on my own to better understand.
0.883300	I believe I do have enough knowledge to make those kinds of decisions.  If I feel confused, I will ask a doctor or nurse. In addition, I will often look up information on the internet as other sources will have a different way of explaining things.

0.722200	"I feel that I have an ability to obtain the needed information if desired through my doctor or nurse, however, I do not always trust this information as they don't always seem to be the most up to date on new medical procedures, new findings, etc. Many times if I were to ask a question or try to obtain further information if they haven't heard or don't feel it's correct will dismiss it without concern just saying ""it's wrong"" despite there being research stating it isn't. I feel that my basic health needs are not always being met by my standards. "
0.916700	I have a doctor that have confidence in and I see her for any illness I have. I also several specialists that I see and I am able to ask questions about my condition and I understand what they are talking about when they explain it to me and when they give me written information about it. I have seen many many doctors in my life and the experience I have had in the last few years is that doctors explain things so that their patients understand exactly what they are talking about.
0.844400	I think I understand most things that come up pretty well. I've never had any problems understanding what I've been told about medical conditions or what I need to do to maintain wellness or get better. I know how to do searches online to find information about things if I need to, and I know what kinds of questions to ask my doctor or a nurse. I am able to comprehend the information on documents and so on that I get from my health providers as well.
0.811100	I was a medic on the FD for 29 years, so I feel like I have at least the basic knowledge to ask the right questions to look after my health. My girlfriend is a pediatric anesthesiologist, so I have a good resource at home to help with difficult questions.
0.805600	Before i even go into a hospital, i google possible conditions and treatments for those treatments, so i can get a decent understanding in laymans terms.

0.700000	I feel that I am very able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  What I have trouble with, is when I read the possible side effects or health risks for medication I am prescribed, I can't tell if it's worth the risk or not.  This is bothersome, and there seems to be no clear way to know - it's like you take your chances when you take a drug, that you will not be one of the ones who has a side effect (some side effects are minimal, but others are very serious - like death!).  I wish there was a better way to assess the risk/benefit of taking drugs.  Also, I am very capable when I am well to make decisions regarding my health, but if I was very sick, I would probably want to make sure I had someone with me who was not sick to help me process information correctly...

0.794400	I think that I can get the information okay. When I don't understand something and no one else is around, I look it up online. Sometimes I ask the doctor or nurse and they can tell me the answer to my question. Sometimes I feel too embarrassed to ask because I don't want to look stupid. I think I make pretty appropriate health decisions, though.
0.844400	I am able to understand basic medical terms and I can pick out wording that appears to absolve doctors of certain liabilities.  If I don't understand a term, I feel confident looking it up.
0.883300	I think I am fully capable of obtaining, processing and obtaining information related to my health. Luckily, the internet is always able to provide answers to things that are not clear.

0.638900	I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.

0.811100	I think I generally understand health information. I find doctor's offices pretty intimidating, so I do find that I sometimes forget to ask questions and get clarification. I've started trying to write everything down ahead of time so I don't forget.
0.705600	I feel I should especially private information concerning myself. I should have the right to because the law permits anyone who wishes.

0.838900	I feel I have the appropriate resources to find the information if I dont understand it.  I could ask my doctor to explain, or I also have access to a medical hotline I can call for answers.  Worst case scerio I can look online for answers to my questions also.
0.738900	I have a basic understanding of how to make appropriate health decisions. But sometimes there are conditions that I could use help to better understand in order to make smart decisions, but doctors are I  such a hurry to get you out of the door you're more likely to get an answer by Googling, and even then results are dubious. 
0.683300	There are times where I am unsure of exactly what the forms are asking. I feel like doctors talk too fast at times trying to explain and then rush out to the next patient. I have a general understanding and feel like I can figure out how to get health information or assertive enough to ask for help. 
0.633300	I feel like I have a basic understanding of most health care information, but I often times don't feel confident in my ability to understand some things.

0.900000	I feel capable and confident in seeking out and understanding health information relevant to making decisions.

0.827800	I can understand at the moment, but after getting home I do sometimes have trouble retaining what was said.
0.650000	I usually understand most health information given to me. Some doctors try to give you the information fast and that can hard to comprehend.
0.850000	As a registered nurse I feel very confident in my capacity. I have also had positions that required me to break down information to teach patients/members. 
0.788900	I feel like I have a pretty good idea of how to obtain health information. If I do not understand something, I am confident in the doctors abilities to help me understand the condition. In addition, I also am confident in the questions I would have for the condition. And if I forget to ask something or think of additiol questions later, I can always contact my doctor. Having all that available information and understanding my circumstances, I feel like I am very capable of making the appropriate health decisions. 
0.777800	As someone with an interest in health, I can understand and process basic information. However, health is rarely basic. Therefore, I sometimes need help from professiols to understand. With a basic understanding of the more easily understandable concepts, I am more prepared to tackle the difficult scerios. 
0.872200	I feel I am capable due to life experience as well as a background in medical processes through the military, family experience and my significant other is a RN at a major hospital in a major city so though these experiences, i believe I am quite capable of understanding basic medical terminology and processes that go with them. 
0.627800	I feel like it's a 50/50 chance I'd be able to do it on my own. The issues I tend to have is I either don't know exactly who to talk to or how to get to the person I need to talk to you.
0.811100	I generally feel like I understand the doctors and the nurses and I'm very comfortable asking questions. Sometimes, I have to contact them after the appointment to verify the information I received is understood correctly.
0.883300	Yes, I believe I can. I am able to process almost all of the information I am given in health situations, and I have people I can ask if there is something I don't understand. I regularly call my insurance company with questions about coverage, and I am comfortable speaking to my doctor about more persol issues. When I have general medical questions, I also sometimes call my brother, who is an internist.
0.655600	I always question everything, i do this so that i can learn. Whether it is about a recipe or a law or my own health care. I get the information from the doctor and than will do my own research. I research every pill that is given me because i want to know exactly what i'm taking and the effects from it.
0.827800	I think that I am able to understand my medical issues more because I have studied biological sciences in college. However, I feel that doctors and nurses tend to only give one option for the issue and do not give further information about altertive treatments. I would have a difficult time making the decisions if I do not have this information.
0.794400	I'm a smart enough person. I'm well educated and well read. I can usually understand most of the materials that I am given. When I can't, I have no fear of asking my doctor or nurse or pharmacist for help. 
0.883300	I work in clinical research and have worked in hospitals for over 20 years.  Having worked with doctors, nurses, support staff, and professors, I feel very confident in dissemiting any information regarding my health.
0.772200	I feel like for the most part I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  Sometimes it can be overwhelming though.  And sometimes it seems some information can be conflicting. 
0.883300	I am cogent enough and doctor savvy enough to get the information I need and ask the questions I need to ask so that I have a full understanding of any procedure and process 
0.811100	For many reasons, I believe I am considerably qualified to understand even the most complex of medical issues.  For over 30 years, I served as a volunteer Paramedic and took advantage of every learning situation possible.  Also, due to significant health issues, (Lyme Disease and Cancer), I was further compelled to be more edified in the entire healthcare process.  And, in my current profession with a dental office, the didactic issues have become paramount when dealing with our patients.
0.916700	I think I am quite good at deciphering medical information and understanding medical terminologies. I have a few medical professiols in my family, so I've been hearing about insurance, procedures, and diagnoses since I was a child. Though I find medicine fasciting, I never went into the field myself. 
0.616700	I think I have enough capacity to process most of what I need to know, but on occasion, I can get a little confused. I don't ask questions sometimes, even when I need to know more to fully understand necessary health information. Some of the information seems pretty daunting to me.
0.866700	I feel I have the capacity to understand health information. If I receive a diagnosis or prognosis that I can't understand or if a medical professiol uses too much jargon too quickly, I often repeat back to the professiol what I understand and allow them to clarify or correct me if I'm not understanding them. 
0.816700	I definitely have the capacity to do all o f the above. I am able to discuss with my doctors and nurses what I have issues with and I have the internet to formulate opinions on things and find information and services myself.
0.916700	i am a retired paramedic so health information is not a problem nor is asking questions and understanding answers
0.900000	I am very confident in my ability to successfully vigate all steps involved in being treated medically. However, as I do not have any medical conditions and have only dealt with health care via a check up every few years, I would say that if I did have a health issue I could imagine not being as confident in dealing with the process.
0.700000	I often have my wife explain to me things when they are too overwhelming or complicated by a doctor or nurse. It's important to get the information from them or I usually end up on the internet looking things up and that is probably the worst thing to do.
0.727800	I think I have decent knowledge. I would like to have an extra opinion though just to make sure I'm making the right decision. 
0.766700	For the most part I feel I can make the appropriate decisions.  I would ask questions on things that I needed clarified.  I would also use the internet to search for answers that I still was unsure of.
0.827800	I rarely go to the doctor, but for the most part, I feel like I understand everything that is discussed between my health care provider and myself.  At least as far as my condition at the time goes.  I do have some problems understanding treatment options and insurance issues.  That is where I need some help.
0.811100	Between asking health professiols in person, and looking up additiol information on the internet, it is easy to obtain the health info I need.
0.916700	I feel like I can do all of these things.  I don't have a hard time understanding things that are explained to me, especially if they involve my health.
0.916700	I understand everything. I could be a damn doctor if I wanted to go to medical school. I understand it all. 
0.777800	I feel I can obtain, process and understand my health information to a mostly satisfactory degree. There have been some instances in the past where I have had trouble understanding what a doctor tells me. In those cases I will ask nurses for clarification, and I also changed my doctor to get someone who communicated better to me. 
0.811100	I feel I understand things written very well, and I am confident in understanding that, but I feel intimidated by medical professiols and sometimes I am hesitant to ask questions. 
0.655600	if i dont understand things i always ask many quistions until i do understand
0.900000	I deal with doctors and forms so much over the last 2 years I'm getting to be a pro at it.. I also don't let doctors walk all over me and not hear my wishes. I live in opioid overdose central so I make sure I know what's going into my body and my doctor isn't just trying to make a new junkie. 
0.844400	I believe the hospitals and doctor's offices try to make things as easy as possible. I'm able to understand what they feel is important for me to know about a medical condition, which is usually more than I know. They treat everyone the same though, and I wish more time and attention would be given to taking my particular circumstances into consideration. My particular questions could help them treat others like me more specifically, but they don't seem to see it that way. 
0.855600	I feel fairly confident that I have the skills to understand what is needed to make health decisions. To do this I use the help of my doctor and the help of the internet to research information.
0.805600	I think I'm capable to process and obtain basic health information. I do have problems when I am not definitively diagnosed with an ailment, but rather given a group of things that it could be. 
0.872200	I feel like I have a fairly good understanding of medical terminology and basic health information. I know that I can ask as many questions as needed, and can always check the internet for anything I might have forgotten to ask. I have many family members in the medical field, and was raised with a basic understanding of how things work, so I am pretty confident.
0.605600	I am good at reading and comprehension. This means I am good at being able read these types of materials to make decisions.
0.788900	I feel like I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as well as services however I would always have a little bit of uncertainty simply because you don't want to make mistakes regarding your health or the health of your children. I definitely think for minor health issues I can comprehend everything quite well but as things get more serious I tend to be a little more doubtful of myself.
0.811100	I believe I am extremely capable of obtaining the information needed, and I am more than capable of understanding the information. Those concepts aren't beyond my reach, because I've always had an affinity for scientific studies, and that includes medical related fields. Making those decisions, however, is difficult for me, because decisions in general are difficult for me to make and motivation is even harder to come by.
0.827800	I feel that I am able to get adequate health information from doctors, nurses as well as through other resources.
0.888900	The doctors I see always explain my condition and my options really well. Whenever I ask questions I feel like they go above and beyond on telling me everything they know to help me understand my illness or whatever I am seeing them for. I also have access to the internet; while not a reliable method for diagnosis, it does have extra information available about practically every illness and condition if I wish to learn more.
0.505600	I usually feel nervous at the doctors. I dont like not knowing information and i hate sounding dumb so I am nervous about asking further questions in an effort to avoid sounding dumb.
0.811100	For the most part, I can understand information given to me by medical professiols. There may be more specific terms that I don't follow, but doctors and nurses are pretty good about explaining those things.
0.850000	I think that I possess the intellect to understand most basic information when it comes to medical information. Of course their are occasions when I am completing a form and I may have a question or not understand exactly what is being asked. Likewise the same may occur when speaking with a health professing, but I am fine with asking them for clarification. 
0.838900	I feel like i am intelligent enough to either understand and ask questions or go and do research on my own to educate myself on things i don't understand. i have been on my own since i was 16 and have had to do these things alone. when you don't have someone to turn to while you are young you learn quick to utilize resources available to you.
0.855600	I think that I have the capacity to do those things. However, I do have issues with feeling that I am bothering my doctor. If I have a new health concern I don't usually call my doctor to inform them. If my appointment is taking too long, I worry that I shouldn't ask too many questions so she can get to her next patient. I don't call when I am having problems, and really only have appointments when I have to have my annual work done. 
0.883300	I'm confident that I have the capacity to learn basic health information and receive services. I ask my doctors questions and they explain things. I also feel like I have access to many other sources of information I can look through on my own.
0.855600	I have great capacity to obtain process and understand basic health info to make appropriate decisions. I ask a lot of questions and make sure the Dr. understands what issues I am having so that I get the best care. I also follow up with the Dr. if I forget to say something about my issues etc. It gets a little murky when the Dr. decides to go down one path and I am not totally clear why, or if I received different info from the same Dr.
0.555600	If I know I am going to the doctor for a specific reason, I will make sure to create a written list of the information I need to relay, as well as the information I need to acquire in order to best b informed.
0.783300	I feel like I am able to make good health decisions however I rarely feel like I have all the information. It feels like there is information my doctor isn't telling me. I would rather they gave it to me straight with all the information so I could really make an informed decision.
0.900000	I think whenever i ask for any question or information regarding anything , my doctor gave me satisfactory answer. However i am not satisfied the way nurses handle the situation. whenever i call doctors office regarding my test results they never replied on time , and sometimes take more than 24 hours to return my call. 
0.916700	I have full confidence in my ability to read and comprehend medical information because English is my tive language. Aside from my fluency in English, I have been unfortute to spend a significant amount of time around doctors and hospitals because of the health of my immediate family. Therefore, I am competent when speaking with doctors and reviewing medical information.
0.861100	I currently work for a regiol medical center in the IT department so I am not unfamiliar with terminology used in paper work or diagnosis.  Before this I had a huge interest in the medical field to begin with, just not enough to be a doctor. 
0.916700	I grew up with both of my parents working in a hospital and was often surrounded by doctors. I am very familiar with medical terminology and human atomy. I also have great insurance (Kaiser) and feel like the nurses and doctors are always willing to fully explain things and listen to my questions. I feel like i have a very high capacity for obtaining and understanding medical information. 
0.916700	I feel it isn't very difficult to understand it as long as it's explained in layman's terms. Anything that doesn't make sense can be elaborated on by a doctor, or even using the internet.
0.838900	I think I have a good capacity to understand what I need to make appropriate health sentences. I have a good understanding of what the doctors tell me and I understand most health material I get.
0.900000	I have a background in medical field-former nurse, so I know a lot about medical terminology and information. Therefore, I feel very confident filling out medical forms but I also ask my spouse to go over information with me just to make sure I did not miss anything important.
0.822200	I am able to easily understand & process basic health information. I'm confident in this having taken several college-level health courses including A&P, Medical Terminology, & Health Information Technology.
0.788900	I feel like I have a good handle on it as long as I have very good explations from my doctor. I won't just let the doctor tell me what to do, I read up on options and come prepared. I have some knowledge of biological process, so I'm good in that way. The only thing that gets me is medical language--it's sometimes hard to understand. 
0.688900	I feel I am capable in making decisions regarding my health, and often fully understand what my doctors tell me. The only times when I am in need of assistance, like from my parents, is with matters related to insurance plans and making appointments. 
0.883300	Knowing a few people in the health care industry and finding it interesting myself, I feel very confident with health information. The internet can further help obtain information that I find questioble. 
0.672200	I BELIEVE I GET ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED WHEN I AM AT THE DOCTOR OR AT THE PHARMACY.  I CAN ALWAYS LOOK UP MORE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET.  SOMETIMES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND MY DOCTOR WHETHER IT IS HER ENGLISH OR HER BIG WORDS THAT I DO NOT HAVE A DEGREE TO COMPREHEND.

0.744400	I feel that I am capable to a certain point in understanding health information.  There are occasions that I am not certain of some information and have to get back in tough with the doctors office to explain something to me.  They do not do a great job unless you know the right questions to ask.  A lot of people do not know how to go about getting enough information they need.

0.916700	I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.
0.661100	I believe I have the capacity to understand the information, but I do think that sometimes it is presented in an unclear way. So I think there are ways to make it easier to understand.
0.566700	I usually have to ask several times and than make them brake it down to where I can understand what they are talking about , usually they use a map of the body to show me how things work , if there are more question I ask , I ask about long term effects

I usually research things on the internet before I even talk to a doctor of some kind to make sure I'll know terminology that may have something to do with my problem. 
0.883300	I have the ability to understand basic health information and services needed. I have had to learn a lot about health care issues due to illness with my grandparents and losing my dad when he was 45. I have had to mage medicine for both grandparents over an extended period of time before they passed recently. I know way more than I actually ever wanted to about medications, neurology, cardiology, and interl medicine.
0.916700	I am a literate and well read person. I regularly deal with contracts and official documents in my regular line of work. Up until now I have had no issues with healthcare paperwork or communicating with healthcare workers I have visited in the past. Basic healthcare information is quite understandable to me.
0.716700	I sometimes have difficulty trying to explain where pain is to doctors, and have had a condition that no one seems to know what it is after a few tests. I still don't know. I am always perplexed by some of the explaitions that I am given and often times go away from an appointment more confused that I was when I went in. I never feel like I have had enough time with the health care providor.

I am an articulate person and understand the importance of voicing my concerns to health care professiols. However, it is difficult for me to share what I believe to be embarrassing information to my doctor and nurses. And for that reason, I believe that my capacity to relay that sort of information to my doctor is limited. 
0.761100	When there is anything unclear I try to get more information from doctor, also sometimes I refer friend for help, she is a nurse. 
0.883300	I have the capacity to understand most things related to my own health. Im a nursing student so alot of things i already know about. This helps me make decisions regarding my health.
0.888900	I'm a pretty sharp guy. I understand what is being told to me. I ask appropriate questions to my situation and understanding. Understanding an issue and acting appropriately on that information are different things, however.
0.716700	I feel fairly confident. I am not a doctor or expert but I am not intimidated either.

0.900000	I feel I am educated enough to either know what the doctor is saying to me upfront or I could research the topic on my own. I feel confident in the health staff to properly explain things to me.

0.833300	I feel like I have a pretty good understanding and capability.  First and foremost, I am going to listen to what my doctor says.  I am also the type of person that has no trouble asking for help when I don't understand something.
0.888900	I'm a 48 year old high school educated male, tive speaker and reader of the English language.  I have the internet at my fingertips.  Anything I do not understand, I have the ability to research on my own.  I am very comfortable doing this.
0.816700	I believe I can obtain, process, and understand most information most of the time. If I have questions I ask the doctor or a nurse. 
0.827800	I feel very confident in my ability. Generally the only time I will reach out or ask someone else for help understanding is if I have reason to believe they know a lot about the topic, and it is a very important procedure, or severe health issue.
0.883300	Based on the questions I just answered I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and to make the appropriate health decisions. The fact that I can understand spoken and written language along with an interest in making health decisions gives me confidence.
0.855600	I think I'm decently capable of learning more about health information to make informed decisions concerning my own health. I think I have a bit of an advantage as I'm currently enrolled in a pre-pharmacy track at my university, but I've always been able to understand my health information without much confusion. That said, when I do feel the need to ask for clarification, I've always been able to get a more thorough explation.
0.666700	I feel like I have the capacity somewhat to understand health information to make decisions. If things are too complicated or the doctor talks too fast, then I can always ask them to clarify or explain it to me again. I can also access a vast amount of information online to research any questions that I might have. 
0.916700	I feel that I am able to take care of my own medical needs in relationship to reading and understanding the given material.  If I do not understand the given material or instructions I am sure to ask a question so I have all the information I need. 
0.916700	I am a very educated individual and I like to be as informed as possible. I take great care of my body and health so I am always asking questions if I have any and I never worry about asking a stupid question. I am very alytical and I want to know all the details so I always dig in and do the proper research.
0.900000	I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services neded to make all appropriate health decisions. I always do this.
0.916700	I feel I have this ability to a great extent. I find that most documents are understandable and I have no problem speaking up and asking questions if something is unclear. I also feel confident about doing further research on any topic and finding sources to add to the basic information from doctors.
0.650000	Sometimes i have a hard time understanding certain medical procedures or whenever a doctor is explaining things to me. I do ask questions but i do not always understand the answers and sometimes i need help filling out forms because i don't know what to put.
0.694400	I feel I have a pretty decent capacity to understand health information. I am proficient in the English language and as long as it isn't medical lingo, I'm usually fine on my own. I also try to ask questions whenever I can but I usually encounter healthcare professiols that are too busy to listen. 
0.800000	I think that I could understand all of the basics...if I had a disease or some special new circumstances, that might be more difficult.  The biggest barrier for me would be speaking up and asking questions.  I am impatient, sometimes I don't want to hear an elaboration on something that scares me, and/or I may feel like I have already taken up enough of the doctor's time.  All of these could be potential barriers for me.
0.800000	I feel like I have the language skills to obtain information relevant to my health.  The barrier (if any) seems to be my discomfort with asking certain questions, or not knowing the right questions to ask.
0.827800	I'm more or less able to comprehend most information regarding medical information and decisions. If and when I find myself confused by something, it is usually due to the manner in which it was written (i.e. It contained unnecessary legalese or terms with which I'm unfamiliar). If I ever find myself having reservations about making making decisions, I am usually able to speak with someone (a receptionist or patient care advocate) who is able to clarify information for me.
0.738900	I think I ask all the question I want answers to. But I don't asks questions I don't want to know the answers to. Such as smoking.
0.722200	I feel like I definitely have the capacity to process and understand health information. Sometimes if there are too many technical terms being used I might have to ask either my doctor or someone else (my sister is an RN so I can call her and ask for her help) to explain in more plain language. But most of the time I don't have a problem. As far as obtaining services and information, that's a little bit trickier. There's the issue of services being available or not available in my area, long waits to see a doctor, and the massive cost of seeing a doctor. And I've had a few issues where I've gone to the ER or the walk-in clinic in my town and ended up seeing a doctor who doesn't seem to care about explaining what's going on to me. But overall I feel like I can probably make appropriate health decisions. Not 100% confident, but at least 70-80%.
0.916700	I've had a few operations and have taken care of a parent with Alzheimer's. While I have a pretty severe phobia of all things medical, I've had enough urgent care to know the ropes and even a lot about interl organs/functions as well as pharma and tural medicine. 
0.900000	I am pretty familiar with medical terminology and how things work.  I am able to successfully google any information I don't know.  I never just take a doctor on their word and do ask questions and do my own research.  Doctors are not always right, whether they are new, stuck in a prescribing rut or have chosen not to be reeducated on current practices for a particular symptom/illness.
0.900000	I know how to fill out forms and ask and answer questions when dealing with doctors and nurses. I don't think it takes multiple sentences to impart that information.
0.811100	I feel like i have a great ability to obtain and understand basic health information because i am confident with my research and communication abilities. For something i do not understand or need clarification i usually try to research it before hand , get an idea of what it is before consulting a health professiol. By the time i consult a health professiol, i usually have a general understanding of whatever it is i need clarification on.
0.900000	Normally when I don't understand something that is hospital related, I do ask enough questions to help me understand what is going on. I also do some research online. 
0.727800	I think for the most part I have the ability to make appropriate decisions.  Sometimes I wish I had more information about how to do some things that I'm not used to doing.
0.883300	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I feel this way because I do not hesitate to request more information and clarification.  I also feel comfortable seeking out information on my own.
0.855600	My mother was a nurse and my father was an EMT so I grew up around medical terminology. I am used to hearing medical words and I feel like I am highly capable of processing and understanding basic health information. I often have an idea of what is wrong with me even before the doctor's diagnosis.
0.916700	I like to follow all instructions given to me by my doctor. I like to read everything the doctor gives to me, especially medications. If there is something I do not understand, I am not hesitant in the slightest to look for something on the internet. 
0.916700	I have a fairly good understanding of  medical terminology having worked in a benefits related industry and also what is required to make a proper diagnosis.
0.844400	I feel that I high capacity to obtain, process and understand health information. I took a nursing class in college and while I would not diagnose myself or others with the information I received from taking the class, it allows me to understand a decent amount of medical language. 
0.916700	I am not a science-minded person, so the medical information I receive is not obvious or tural to me. Therefore I like to listen to everything a medical professiol says to me, because I am learning along the way. Since I like learning about new things in life, I have no problem being interested and understanding what they are telling me.
0.916700	I am cognizant of my health condition and fully able to make my own decisions. I easily understand the options available to me and what course of medical treatment offers the best outcomes.  
0.744400	I struggle at times to understand printed material, particularly literature about prescribed medicines. Sometimes I have difficulty understanding a doctor's verbal explations, especially since they are always short on time. 
0.783300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to receive information that will allow me to make appropriate health decisions. I realize a lot of other people lie or omit information when dealing with health care professions and this seems completely counter-intuitive me so I try my best to be open and honest in my communications.
0.783300	Pretty good. Not illiterate. Can read.
0.783300	I think I have a very good ability to understand and process basic health information and make decisions. I was taught by my parents to ask doctors the necessary questions and to understand all diagnosis given to me by doctors before leaving the office.  
0.827800	i believe i can understand what my healthcare professiols tell me about my health. i rarely need anyone to explain things to me. if i don't understand something, i search the internet to find out more information. the internet is very helpful in finding out information.
0.900000	I am very capable of processing and understanding basic health information. First we have the lovely world wide web and there are A LOT of reputable sources to get information. Just need to make sure it is indeed reputable, like Web MD. I also do not have issues getting information from health professiols when I need it, that's what they are there for.

0.783300	I think I've got a pretty average capacity to obtain and understand health information and services. I don't always know everything I need to know, but I'm not too bad at researching things and can often find things out on my own. I'm not an expert though, so it's possible for me to miss out on things or misunderstand some information.
0.794400	I feel like I have a higher degree of understanding about basic health information than the average person and my family.  Because health interests me, I like to read about conditions I have experienced or those around me have had on my own as well as speak to friends who have medical degrees.  I think I absorb what I hear about basic health information really well and retain it because I am so fascited by it.  Also, I have had some family members with serious medical issues so have had a lot of practice having to make choices and ask questions.
0.883300	I feel like I have a decent ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  If I don't understand something I ask questions and I usually end up doing research on health related maters online so that I can better understand anything I may not understand.
0.844400	i have no issues filling anything out. i normally have a good idea whats wrong with me due to healthcare websites like webmd and such. it is typically hard to ask questions to a doctor because they usually are running behind and are in and out of the room in less than 5 minutes so they are not always available to answer all questions if i have any
0.861100	I feel I can make informed decisions and obtain necessary information as I have friends who I can consult and also use the internet when I need to read and find out more about certain topics. 
0.827800	I think I can process most of the information the doctors tell me. The usually also give me written information for me to take home and read. So the written information helps as well.

0.900000	I have a high degree of being able to understand health information. My doctor is excellent with explaining and making sure I understand. I have also used Google to search for health knowledge.
0.672200	I feel like I can get by fairly well. I always ask my doctor questions, and when there are things on forms I don't understand (or I have a nurse help me). I don't understand everything on medical papers, but I think I know enough to gauge health decisions.
0.738900	I think I have a good capacity to obtain help when I need to make decisions concerning my health. I have family members who are able to help me fill out forms when I don't understand certain questions. The doctors and nurses are pretty helpful as well when I don't understand something, whether that deals with information I'm filling out or the information they give me concerning their judgement on my health. All in all, I haven't had too much trouble in this area. 
0.788900	I mainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services, although I do have difficulty with communication due to having high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder. I tend to not ask questions that I should ask because of being uncomfortable with communication.
0.916700	I feel confident in my ability to handle health information. I have a background in health insurance, so that part of the equation is very easily understood. I also have fine research skills, a large vocabulary and enough general experience at the age of 48, that I know how to find out anything, of which I am unsure. I'm ufraid to speak with health care professiols. 
0.850000	i think i am about average, i have had some but limited experience 
0.916700	A great deal. I can ask questions of the medical person. I can also look up more info online. I use different methods to find needed clarity.
0.916700	I'm not shy. I have no trouble talking to people in normal situations and important matters such as my health I'm even less likely to remain silent. If I have questions I ask. Even at routine medical checkups I have questions for my doctor either about the current situation or some other issue that has been bugging me.
0.744400	I have taken medical terminology I and II and earned A's in both. I have also done some research on my conditions. Because of that, I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I've even taken a nutrition course.
0.827800	I have a pretty good grasp on my health and health issues. I do a lot of research on the chronic conditions I have as well as the treatments and medications. Most of the information I obtain comes from trusted sources on the Internet rather than my health professiols. Many times I feel like just a number to my health care providers.
0.633300	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. The reason for this is that I can usually understand and process basic information, but when it comes to things such as specific terms or words I do not understand them which causes me to not understand more things. I sometimes also do not ask all of the questions I should  if I do not fully understand something. 
0.900000	I have enough experience on the matter to know what is being considered. I know what is told me and I know the basic issues. I can understand what is provided and make appropriate choices.
0.916700	I have a lot of confidence in myself to be able to understand and process basic health information. If I had questions after leaving a doctor's office, I would search for information on my prior before calling back. Anytime anyone I've known has had a medical condition, I always research it as well. I have never worked in the medical field, but I do learn quickly and comprehend what I do find on my own.
0.777800	I feel as if I can understand the basics of what is said, but occasiolly the use of the technical terms can get confusing compared to what most people would call a condition. Most forms are very simple to fill out though. 
0.872200	I can understand all information provided to me in order to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.827800	I understand what they tell me for the most part, but I do get hung up on the science behind it sometimes. If I don't understand the science I research it a bit online to get a better understanding because I'm slow on stuff like that.

0.822200	I feel confident in my capacity to understand health information to make good health decisions.  Sometimes I think I have too much information, rather than too little, since the internet has much information on health these days. Once I've met with clinicians though I do believe they are able to sift through any problems I have in order to give me the proper care.
0.638900	I feel like I know a lot of the information given to me. Many times, however, I only understand the basics.  When doctors start going into the science of the problem I get confused. I usually don't have a problem obtaining my patient information. 
0.794400	I feel pretty confident in my ability. However, sometimes when new information is given it's hard to process it on the spot and know which questions to ask. I often think of questions after I have left the doctor's office. 
0.800000	I try to pay close attention to what the Dr. says.  If I'm not sure what the problem is I ask them to explain better.
0.733300	I believe I have huge experience in this field, as my wife is ill for couple years and I'm talking to radio and chemo-therapy doctors. Not by choice, but I think I'm pretty capable... 
0.827800	I think I certainly have the literacy skills. I read and write better than most people I know and have a good vocabulary. But I don't have a lot of specialized medical knowledge, so sometimes I do feel like I don't have all the information I need to make a good decision or to understand what a doctor tells me. I think compared to most other people who aren't doctors or nurses, I'm doing well, but there are still a few times when I wish I were more confident.
0.777800	For the most part, the services I receive are superb, the only trick is waiting to get a appointment, which can sometimes take a month or longer. I feel that for the most part I understand the health system and the information provided me as well as the services, but sometimes I ask for help or opinions and explation when necessary.
0.916700	I feel very capable of doing these things. I feel confidednt in my ability to obtain and understand information about my health care. I feel that I am able to trust my own reasoning and decision making. 
0.855600	I am extremely confident in my ability to understand what was told to me. And if I had not understood, I'm confident in being able to understand through research or consulting others.  I would usually go with my mother and significant other to their doctor visits in order to explain to them what the doctors and nurses mean.
0.755600	I feel I am able to understand most things related to my healthcare if they are explained to me. I am able to understand most simple medical terms. However I do not always feel that I have access to the explations I sometimes need to make informed decisions. Often times I get very little time to speak with my doctors because they have to be with another patient. 
0.622200	I feel that I have a basic understanding of information and to process everything to make appropriate medical decisions, but sometimes there is a depth to these processes that require a deeper understanding.
0.888900	I feel I have great capacity to understand health information given to me, as well as make decisions for myself. If I have any questions, I am usually thorough about asking them to healthcare professiols.
0.655600	I feel like I can answer about all of the questions right. Usually they are pretty straight forward.  They don't use too much jargon that the average person cannot understand.  Very rarely sometimes the questions are worded in a way that you don't know what answer they are looking for.
0.627800	I have a decent capacity for those things but I definitely need some help understanding some things. A lot of what I see seems to be written in a foreign language so I sometimes ask for help. I definitely need to ask more questions when I am speaking with a nurse or doctor. I just feel like I am asking a stupid question so I am too nervous to speak up
0.872200	I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information and make decisions. My doctors are very clear and helpful and always explain in detail if I need further clarification. They also lay out the options clearly so I can make an appropriate decision.
0.916700	I feel like I am very able to understand and obtain health information and services that I need. I have a pretty thorough backing in biology and have taken atomy and physiology classes in college, so that gives me a good working knowledge of anything that a medical professiol needs to communicate to me. I also have good health insurance through my husband's employer, and so have always been able to obtain medical care when I have needed it. I am also in good health and am generally self-confident so I don't really feel intimidated at the doctor's office and therefore have never had a problem asking a doctor or nurse for a clarification or additiol information. 
0.883300	I've worked in the healthcare field for most of my life in one way or another. I feel like I can understand just about anything thrown my way and I can make the right decisions regarding my health and treatment.
0.811100	I persolly feel I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding the basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision. I am able to accomplish this by questioning my healthcare providers and also reading through materials or seeking additiol information online if necessary.
0.833300	I feel like I have enough of an understanding of health issues that may arise that I can discuss options with my doctor or doctors. I also only go to doctors that I trust to help me make the right decisions. I have a couple close friends who are nurses so I can always talk to them if there's something I'm not completely sure of.
0.716700	I feel as though I can process most information fairly well. I have had issues in the past with having a lack of confidence in doctors explaining, but never my own understanding. 
0.688900	I worked in a hospital as their accounting staff, that may be the reason why I can understand easily their given information to me. But, I always ask them to read it for me to clarify that my understanding to my medical record is really what it seems to be.
0.866700	I feel that I am able to achieve this to a pretty high degree. Most times my health provider will provide a good enough verbal description of what I need to know and is available to answer any questions. I think what helps me the most, is that prior to going in and seeing someone, I research and look into my issue myself which gives me that ability to have some prepared questions or address any concerns. I have never had a problem following up with my provider with a phone call or email with a question and them not explaining what I need to know.
0.761100	I feel it to a moderate degree. When in doubt, I usually consult with my sister, who is a nurse practitioner. 
0.794400	I think I have a reasobly high capacity of health information.

0.727800	For the most part I feel confident in my ability to understand basic health information, as long as it's just basic. Once medical jargon and terminology starts to be used, I get a little lost. Whatever I do have trouble processing, I can just turn to the internet for answers.
0.916700	I am extremely proficient at maging my health. I live a very healthy lifestyle and my great health reflects that. I understand exactly what i must do to maintain great health.
0.777800	Sometimes it can be difficult to obtain your health records due to the office being too busy. It can also be difficult to have them explain in detail what is going on with you because they have so many patients and not a lot of time.
0.916700	I think I have a great ability to understand what doctors and nurses are trying to tell me. I am familiar with some of the language used to describe medical conditions, and I tend to ask questions in areas that I'm not strong with. 
0.916700	I feel that I perfectly competent to make basic health decisions. I am a tive English speaker and routinely complete medical information forms by myself without help.
0.761100	With all the doctors and nurses help I feel like I can make adequate decisions in my Healthcare.  Doctors and nurses are always really helpful and I feel like I can rely on them  
0.750000	When a doctor or health professiol is there in front of me, I am usually comfortable asking questions and finding out answers. In this case it is usually pretty easy and straightforward as these people are usually able to help. However, when I do not have one of these people, finding the answers to my questions is much harder. I usually use the internet to find my answers but finding a reliable source on the internet is not always easy. 
0.916700	I feel I have a good doctor and am able to openly communicate and discuss issues with them. I am open about my health issues which I think you need to be in order to get the help you need. I understand for the most part what the Dr says and what I am not sure of I ask questions. My husband will also ask questions which further helps with any questions that may arise or answers we may need. My husband and I share the same Doctor and we typically schedule appointments at the same time so the Doctor sees us together in an hour block.  This also helps us communicate better as we are both there and can both ask questions we may have
0.900000	I have the capacity to read and understand information and services because I have had extensive medical issues during to an auto immune system disease.  I research anything I am told until I fully understand it and then discuss with my doctors in depth.  I have a background in language and that background has aided me in understanding complex issues with my health.
0.822200	I feel pretty confident. I have taken some medical classes in the past and that has really helped with explaining and being able to break down medical terminology  I also have a nurse for a mother so it makes it really easy to get answers to questions or if I don't understand something.
0.866700	I think it is really important that if you are being seen by a health care professiol that you understand what you are being told. If you do not understand then you MUST ask questions so that you are clear on what may be wrong or any instructions that they may give you.

0.555600	I don't have obama care, so I don't feel I have access
0.738900	I feel like I'm pretty god at understanding my medical conditions and history. I'm young enough that I don't have a ton to deal with.  I will ask the doctor when I visit if I don't understand something.
0.883300	I feel i have a high capacity to understand and process information that's been given to me. I feel this way because i consider myself intelligent.  In addition , or maybe it goes hand and hand, i do my research on any topic i have questions on. I will never blindly take the advice or recommendations of Doctors/Nurses without also doing my own due diligence. 
0.705600	I think I understand medical information about myself fairly well. If I ever have any difficulty, I can just ask my husband and he will help me figure it out. If he is uvailable then I would ask the nurse or doctor for clarification of any information I don't understand.
0.838900	I feel that I am able to comprehend what I am told by my doctors. While I sometimes have a hard time understanding the insurance benefits I do understand and am able to fill out all the necessary forms and documentation. I normally understand what I am told about my health and treatments.
0.516700	I think that I have the capacity of the average person to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. At times, I do need assistance filling out forms because I am afraid that I will do so improperly and they will not have all the information needed because I misinterpreted a question. Also at times, I try to process the information they give me and am afraid to ask questions so I then go home and search on the internet for further information. 
0.838900	I have full capacity to process and understand basic health information to make health decisions
0.838900	I feel very comfortable. I have no issues talking to doctors. I will tell them anything. I don't worry about holding anything back. I usually understand everything they say, and if I don't I ask questions. 
0.855600	I feel like I have all appropriate knowledge and information. I can obtain all necessary info and feel good talking with medical professiols about my health.
0.750000	I think I am well equipped to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have been seeing a doctor regularly for the same issue for decades and I understand the information. However, this was not always true since years ago I had a lot of trouble understanding-- since then I have read a lot about my issues so it is no longer confusing for me.  
0.705600	I feel semi-confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services. I do find difficulty when attempting to get answers from health professiols. I generally notice that health professiols automatically assume that people have a general understanding of all aspects regarding health but I don't believe this is the case. This makes decision making more difficult. 
0.855600	i have have no problem understanding medical language and if i do have a question i call back after i get home
0.844400	I feel I do for the most part.  I know basic stuff
0.872200	I don't feel I'm lacking in any of these areas. Between what the medical practitioner I usually see (a PA) tells me and the ability to fill in the gaps with information I can find on the Internet, I feel like I'm able to keep myself pretty well informed with what I need to know. That said, I don't currently deal with anything overly complicated either. When my dad was diagnosed with a rarer form of blood cancer, the learning process they went through was not as simple.
0.805600	I feel like I am completely capable of understanding information given to me by health care workers.  Although I don't always ask questions like I should, I know that I am able to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.805600	I feel like I can obtain and process basic health information effectively. It's only when there is a complication that I don't always get the information I need or follow up material to make an informed decision. Or sometimes I don't think of  question till long after I have left the doctor's office.
0.422200	Based on the questions I answered, I realized I don't understand much about health information. There are many terms used that I don't know and often I don't know where to start asking questions. If information were described to me in simple terms, I would be able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I understand everything any medical professiol can tell me and ask questions if I don't.
0.794400	if i don't understand something and i am not at the doctor's office, i can ask a family member to help me or go online for help. the answers are there, you just have to ask a person or online.
0.711100	I feel fairly competent to obtain and understand health information that is given to me. I studied biology in college (it was my major) and was considering going into medicine, but decided on another field later on. I have accumulated a lot of knowledge on health issues and factors over the years, through reading online and keeping track of my own health. 
0.916700	While I lack medical expertise on any of its subjects, I in general have good reading comprehension and can at least partially understand things that I don't know about using context. I also know how to ask good questions, when necessary, and have good research skills to investigate a lot of things on my own. 
0.816700	"I think that the doctors who I am a patient under are generally capable of explaining my problems to me. The forms are also easy enough to understand. The problem starts with me and my disconnect between doctors. I don't speak the language of medicine, and I don't know how to properly express symptoms. So there is a moment when the doctor asks me if I have any questions, but I say I do not. I only come to find out days or weeks later that I should have asked certain questions when I run into problems. For instance, I never used to consider the side effects of medications until I started suffering them, and when I did start to talk to doctors about them I could not just say ""tell me about the side effects,"" because they would only discuss the most common ones. If not for the fact that I suffered rare side effects, I would not have known that you have to push the issue in order to learn about the effects doctors feel aren't worth mentioning."
0.916700	I have no problem processing health or health related information . I am a retired Paramedic and my wife is a nurse
0.794400	I feel that I am fully capable of asking questions surrounding my own healthcare. The problem is I can become embarrassed or shy while I'm trying to advocate for my needs and make sure that I get all the information that I need to. It's also hard for me when the doctor or a nurse is behind schedule or seems to be in a rush. If that's the case, then I'm almost afraid to ask a question because I don't want to get the brush-off. 
0.888900	COMPLETELY
0.916700	I think I have complete capacity to obtain my health information and also understand what I am reading or being told. When there is something I do not understand I have never had a problem asking questions or finding someone to help me better understand the information.
0.744400	I PRETTY MUCH UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION BEING GIVING. HOWEVER, SOMETIMES THERE ARE CERTAIN TERMS I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND. I JUST LIKE MAKING SURE ABOUT MY HEALTH, WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT TAKE OR DO AND THE AFFECTS OF THE MEDICINE I TAKE. A LOT OF MEDICATIONS CAUSE SERIOUS SIDE AFFECTS. I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNOW WHAT I AM GETTING INTO.
0.627800	I'm not confident at all that I obtain what I need to. A lot of the blame lies with me I guess. I am a nervous person, and I usually want to get away from people ( especially medical people) fast. If they seem busy or annoyed, I fell like running away. Fortutely I have a very nice DR. who usually explains a lot of what I need to know without me asking. 
0.672200	I have good common sense, so therefore I can understand things that are common. When it comes to the technical terms and jargon of the medical profession I like to get help just so that I do not misunderstand anything
0.900000	I have taken human atomy and physiology in high school and I have taken a health class, so I am aware of a lot of basic information that they would tell you. Most results I have obtained in the past few years are online, which usually give you more information than you need.
0.788900	I feel like I have an above average knowledge of health information. My mom and dad both work in the health industry and I have learned a lot from them through out the years. I have also done some own private research on some health topics as it interests me.
0.816700	I feel like I have a very good capacity to understand my medical history,  The only time I really had a problem, was when I was having brain seizures and I was going into a coma.  People were explaining things, but I could not understand what they were saying.
0.672200	Sometimes I struggle to understand what Doctors say if it just scientific medical jargon. I also worry that they are just trying to legally protect themselves by stating things so matter of factually. Usually nurses are the ones who explain things to me in more of an understandable way.
0.844400	From my experiences and helping others, I know that the best way to help yourself with medical issues is to research and figure out issues mainly by yourself. So I feel very confident in my abilities to research and figure out problems even before seeing a doctor. By doing this I have gone in with knowledge and correctly diagnosed an issue that the doctor got wrong even. 
0.755600	"I feel like I have a pretty high capacity to obtain and process health information. Thankfully, I've lived a very healthy life and haven't had all that many interactions with healthcare professiols. But I owe that in part to my interest in health, exercise, and nutrition on a hobby level. I've studied a variety of health topics simply because it interests me; over the years I've read dozens of books on health and nutrition, disease, and pharmacology. I'm a curious person that likes to know how things work, and the human body happens to be one of those things I like to learn about. I read a number of health related blogs, occasiolly listen to health related podcasts, and have even dug in to scientific papers in medical jourls before. So I have much more background information than the typical person - nowhere near that of a medical professiol of course, but I can ""talk the talk"" better than most on a variety of health related topics, I believe. If anything, I'm more confused by the bureaucratic side of things. Insurance plans and coverage, law and tax related issues etc. are about as complex as the human body itself these days. I can't quite get myself as interested to learn more about that, but I know if I needed to research details of my plan or my options, I'm confident I could find and process that information too."
0.916700	I feel I have average or better capability.
0.744400	I am married with a nurse .She is working at a hospital.Though my health is pretty good,I had 2 back surgeries 2 years ago.I had to fill in some forms and read some information,and she was of great help.She knows,what I have to ask and knows the meaning of the difficult words.
0.794400	"To a high degree. Even when I'm at the Doctors I don't understand him sometimes, he'll say a word that's foreign to me and sometimes I don't ask him about it because I feel ""dumb"" for asking so I take note of what he's saying and google it. "
0.855600	I feel I am completely able to understand any thing I'm told by the doctor or nurse, and am able to all questions correctly to get the answers I need on the things I do not.  I usually do not have an troubles with any forms or reading I am supposed to fill out.
0.850000	i have the pretty much capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions....
0.833300	I feel like I'm fully capable. Anything I'm unsure of I can always look up on the internet. 
0.916700	I believe I can handle all the healthcare information myself. I am a mother and have spent my life covering health issues for my children, and sadly my husband also. Because I put myself in that position, I spent a lot of time figuring out how to deal with all the decisions and paperwork and communication that were needed to deal with health issues. 
0.744400	Relatively well but often times I feel my doctors just regurgitate what they learned in a book and follow what is in a book often ignoring any pain I have and prescribing me pain medication instead of fixing the problem. Often times when I ask why they will simply dumb down the answer as a categorization of allergies or an old injury without going in depth into the cause when I feel I deserve a longer explation. 
0.900000	I am confident in my ability to obtain and comprehend medical information. I have always had a great interest in the subject of medicine, and am usually at least somewhat familiar with common medical problems and their treatments. If there's anything that is not completely clear when discussing medical issues with doctors, I research it myself using reliable sources.
0.733300	I always try to be sure that I understand whatever I am told by the doctor (or other medical person).  But sometimes they are in a hurry and I might be asking for details that they don't think matter so they don't really explain everything.  Like when I took my child to the doctor with a fever and the doctor said be sure the child get plenty of fluids.  I understood that, but I asked why is that important and was just told that it is and see you later.  
0.916700	I feel I definitely know how to get all information effectively. I speak fluent English, consider myself intelligent, and have taken plenty of science courses.
0.827800	I know that I can understand the information given to me, but it seems to be difficult to get that information in the first place. There aren't a lot of places that you can go to find dependable information for you to make your decisions. Hospitals and doctors are expensive to see and impossible to deal with if you are just needing information and websites can be confusing and misleading.
0.883300	I feel that the information is obtaible, it's more a matter of knowing where to go to obtain the information you need. It's the starting point that is the biggest challenge.
0.850000	I have the mental capacity of understanding my basic health info and services. Usually my doctor and nurses are pretty reliable. Though some are set in their old ways and think certain things are the answer to everything. I'm pretty sure how to take care of my health information and services on my own. If I need any further assistance I usually ask for the help.
0.883300	I FEEL I HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN, PROCESS, AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTHINFORMATION AS I AM A FAIRLY INTELLIGENT PERSON, AM NOT SHY ABOUT ASKING THINGS ABOUT WHICH I HAVE LITTLE BACKGROUND OR UNDERSTANDING (PARTICULARLY ABOUT THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE-SUCH AS HEALTH MATTER), AND HAVE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH HEALTH ISSUES, PROFESSIOLS, AND THE ASSOCIATED FORMS. ALL OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE HAD SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS AND EXZTENDED HOSPITAL STAYS, AND I HAD TO SUPERITEND A COUPLE OF THOSE. MY KIDS AND WIFE SIMILARLY. I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS STUFF.
0.850000	I can read, understand and process basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions easily. I do not have difficulty to deal with these issues because I have visited my primary doctor routinely, and have enough medical knowledge on these aspects.
0.827800	To a great degree, because I research everything. My husband is afflicted with several chronic conditions, and I am his only care giver. I cannot tell you how many doctors and nurses for sub par care and blatant mistakes.
0.572200	I believe I have the necessary capacity to needed to understand health information relating to health decisions. I have a basic working understanding of my own health and information relating to my diagnosed conditions.  Although if the material I am given is not presented in non-medical terms, I may need assistance or elaboration to understand fully. 
0.794400	I asked the doctor the questions that trouble me and he explains my concerns very well and when I go home I do a little research of my own as well.
0.811100	I feel pretty confident until I actually get to the Drs office - it can be overwhelming. Nerve racking. You forget what you want to say (i try to write things down) but also, it sometimes goes so fast that you forget or blank out.  It always helps when the Dr gives you pamplets, but those can also be either vague or way too much info or jargon.
0.794400	I think in a serious medical situation we are all a bit nervous and anxious, I always go with my parents so I can listen and ask questions and later explain if necessary.  When I go to the doctor I am usually alone and I find it difficult getting the doctor to listen to me, to actually hear what I am saying.  Sometimes I feel like they've just made up their mind and they need me to move along as quickly as possible.  I usually end up just leaving with questions unswered.
0.866700	I think I have a good ability to make health decisions because I am able to read and understand medical information, as long as it is geared towards the general public. I am generally confident in asking questions of providers if I'm unsure. I have a good grasp of English and try to be prepared to get information when I see a doctor.
0.672200	It takes me some time, but if there's something I need to figure out with regard to my health, I'm usually able to figure it out. Luckily my mother is a family practice doctor, so when I need help understanding health information and services I can usually call her and she'll explain it to me. Sometimes, though, there are things that I don't know and I don't know the right questions to ask to figure it out, so I'm left in the dark. 
0.755600	I am not shy and a fairly good talker so I usually talk with nurse s and I can usually get whatever information is needed. If something is a bit fuzzy that I approved (or need time to approve) I will go home and Google it. Plus I can also go by my own experience and decide if something is appropriate for me. If I still don't have the answer I will call or talk more in person if needed.
0.677800	I think I have the capacity.  Sometimes I do not know what is wrong with me.  Sometimes I think the doctor or practitioner is in a rush.
0.888900	I am very confident that I can understand a doctor's diagnosis pertaining to my health. If there ever is a question I have, I make sure to ask the doctor right away so that I know what is happening with my health.
0.872200	I find that I often understand basic health information and medical instructions better than many people. I'm sometimes asked to help others because I am competent in this area. If there's something I don't understand I do some research until I feel comfortable with the material; or if I don't get enough information from my own research, I feel comfortable asking for help from the staff at my doctor's office or other medical professiols.
0.883300	I am not afraid to ask questions, which is very important. I will do further research online to see what else are my altertives, and then ask about them. I also have family in the health field to consult with if I have a major decision to make.
0.916700	Sometimes my Doctor who is a total nerd talks in technical terms. He has a thick accent so I have to tell him to explain it to me plainly.
0.888900	I feel I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I feel my reasoning skills are above average as well as my problem-solving skills which allow me to be successful in this task.
0.866700	I think that I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information that is given to me by doctors and nurses.  I have been lucky to not have had any major health issues over the course of my life but I am confident when I go to the doctor for a routine checkup that I will be able to understand what they are telling me and implement any suggestions that they give me.
0.900000	In have complete capacity to obtain, process and understand ant health information that I have. I rarely need to ask questions for clarification and can very easily comprehend most information.
0.794400	I believe I understand the information presented to me enough to make my own decisions. I've only gone to the doctor offices a few times however not enough to know everything. If I don't understand something I make a point to ask for further details.

0.916700	I am a middle aged man who has no problem understanding English. I have a college degree in the sciences, so yes, I can understand technical instructions. If something is unclear I can ask a nurse or doctor to explain it further. I also have a good relationship with my doctor so conversations come easy. 
0.916700	I am quite literate in medical terminology.  I am capable of searching the internet to find additiol information.  I am not intimidated by medical people.  The last two times I visited a doctor, I described my symptoms, provided a diagnosis and identified the treatment.  Each time, the doctor agreed.
0.772200	I definitely have the capacity but sometimes I am tentative to ask for clarification of things or ask the doctor for more information because I do not want to sound stupid or get nervous of the answers if I ask more. I'm also young so I sometimes need to speak with my parents before filling out forms and such.
0.866700	Given the amount of information available on the internet, it is easy to look up medical information that I have not heard of or have difficulty understanding. Many medical community backed webpages such as Medscape aid in providing information 
0.916700	Im certain i can access this information very well because i know were to obtain the information i need whenever I may need it. The greatest advantage id that I can obtain all the information I need about how to ensure my health online. Online is were I get the majority of my information that pertains to health.

0.816700	I believe as long as I understand the diagnosis I am fine. I may question some of the side effects in which I could get and also forms referencing any sort of insurance information. As the information pertains to my health or my insurance I am very clear on understanding what is being put into it at that time.
0.772200	I typically don't have a problem understanding the information given to me. However, there are times that I want to get additiol information regarding a condition or treatment and I find it difficult to actually get a hold of anyone that is competent enough to fulfill my request. The doctors are either too busy or just too short on their answers to provide me with an adequate enough answer.

I learned cpr and many health aspects while serving in the Marine Corps, worked briefly in an emergency room and studied clinical mental health. I am also not a shy person so i'm not afraid to ask a lot of questions or asking a doctor, nurse or pharmacist to explain something to me differently so that I can better understand. I take my health and the health of my family seriously so it is important for me to stay informed. I am also for getting second opinions to see more optiosn available to me and I also use the internet pubmed to learn more about any medical issues we may have going on.

0.872200	I'm generally fine at understanding any information or materials given to me. I can normally fill out forms, etc., fine, but I'm always anxious I'll make a mistake. I don't always ask questions when it might be appropriate, which I sometimes regret later when I realize there's information I needed.

0.633300	I feel that I can make decisions regarding my own health to a greater degree than professiols.

0.827800	I feel pretty confident researching my health conditions, evaluating study abstracts, and staying on top of new information. Sometimes I have a hard time talking with health care professiols, though. I think they're used to doing the same thing for everyone with a particular health condition and don't understand how my multiple conditions interact with each other. 
0.916700	I feel like anything I don't understand that's given to me by a doctor or nurse would be easily understood after they explain it to me. If I didn't understand it then I would simply ask and that should be enough.
0.811100	I believe I am intelligent and knowledgeable enough to understand most of the medical information that is given to me. I also tried to stay informed and if need will research things I do not understand.
0.794400	I believe that I am confident enough to get through acquiring a health service. I do not have a ton of experience and sometimes the wording gets confusing. I think that usually though I will eventually get through it successfully. I've never had help filing my taxes and that usually goes pretty well.
0.900000	I think I get the information I need but I can't say for certain because I don't know what I don't know.  In general, when I'm visiting with my physician I feel free to ask questions and will often paraphrase what I've been told and repeat it back to the doctor or nurse to make sure I've understood it correctly.
0.822200	I have a basic knowledge of some of the medical jargon that has been used around me when it comes to my body. I have had diagnoses thrown at me occasiolly that I haven't been able to understand until someone has explained them in a language that I understood. When I was in my twenties, I was told that I was Septic. I didn't understand. they gave me paperwork to read over, but with the infection of that magnitude, I couldn't read.  I have had diagnoses with my mental health as well, I wasn't sure what the treatment meant, until someone explained it to me. There was a time where I was taking Lithium. (2011) I took it for two years, I lost joy, and my ability to comprehend written or read information. Once I was switched to a different medication, it took two years for me to even be able to comprehend a page long news article. I am doing much better now, but there are still moments that i feel foggy, or loose memory of certain words. I will have to google things to remember what the words mean. 
0.855600	I can explain what the problem is. I can listen to the answers and I usually understand them. Sometimes I ask additiol questions to clarify something.
0.883300	I read about medical issues, symptoms, and treatments online or ask family and friends. I look up medical terminology to understand subject matter i do not understand. I also try to look online for answers to better understand medical problems
0.555600	i think it is very hard to understand most of what they tell you. i can understand the basics to my problems like eat less to loose weight but when they go into more detail and reasoning behind things i get lost.
0.805600	I have no problem keeping my medical appointments, however I write a list of things to ask when I meet with my Dr. and I forget to take my list with me. I'm married to a retired RN and she is a big help with my understanding my health care. I'm seeing 5 specialists so it's hard to keep on top of it. It's almost a full time job but easier thanks to the internet.
0.844400	"I depend entirely on myself to research my health conditions and my options because I am ethically and philosophically opposed to the techniques used by ""modern"" medicine. I refuse invasive procedures (surgeries) and medications. Since this puts me in opposition to 99% of the physicians out there, I never visit a doctor and rely on myself to research what types of noninvasive, tural remedies are available to me."
0.727800	By and large, I understand what's given to me to read or am told by health professiols. Sometimes the reading may have terms or wording I don't understand, but all it takes is asking a simple question to clarify things. I'm confident I understand everything by the time I'm done.
0.866700	I feel like I can understand basic information because I try to ask as many questions as possible. I am a very anxious and paranoid person, so if I don't ask questions I'll regret it later and have to call or go back to get them answered. I'd rather look a little ignorant  by making someone reiterate something to me, then be completely in the dark. 
0.888900	While I don't know much about medical or health related information, I am generally a smart person. I can figure most things out myself with a little research. If there is something that I don't understand, I have family who I can ask to help me out.
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable of making health decisions for myself. My intellectual ability has never been lessened by a health concerned.
0.872200	I believe I am fully capable of understanding health information given by to me by doctors, and I am also fully capable of providing accurate health information.  I believe I am intelligent enough to comprehend and conduct independent research, and make decisions based on the information I am given.  I think I have a healthy dose of skepticism when given information as well.
0.594400	I feel like I am able to obtain the information rather easily, as well as process it. Although when I am being told health related things or how to take care of myself , my mind shuts down and I refuse to actually take in the information permanently.  I understand most of it but it doesn't stick with me much after I leave the doctor/health professiol.
0.838900	I believe I'm presented with everything I need about my health informatiob. When my doctor leaves out I normally have a nurse come in behind to make sure I understood everything about my visit
0.705600	I feel that I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions because my doctors/healthcare providers generally give me the information I need, and if they don't give me the information up front, I can ask questions and they will answer them. If I have questions about my medication or other issues, I can call my doctor's office to get information regarding that. I also have friends and family that can help answer questions about certain health issues.
0.750000	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Both of my parents are doctors so I can always go to them for my health questions since they are both very intelligent and knowledgable as well. I feel there are many other resources out there to get the information I need in order to be able to understand most health information.
0.633300	i know when i feel headache and i consult doctor but most of the time i feel difficulties to understand when i feel back pain join pain i took calcium and iron suppliment. i walk daily and also vitmain suppliment.
0.727800	I feel I have all the capacity to understand my health decisions. Also I find doing more research on looking up on my computer more helpful.
0.755600	I think I ask a moderate amount of questions to clarify most of the information given to me by professiols, which I think is the whole key no matter what my mental capacity - you ask until they dumb it down for you to a more comfortable level.
0.827800	It seems that most medical professiols are really good at explaining things simply right from the start. At times, I really wish they would be more detailed but most are too rushed. In the few times I get any sort of information in writing, I will save it even after reading it to be sure I have a record. I think most information is pretty straight forward. 
0.883300	I think I have the ability to understand everything.  If there was something I didn't understand, I would ask the medical official for clarification, or seek out answers from friends or the internet.
0.900000	I think that I am quite knowledgeable and proficient in understanding and processing healthcare information. I know a lot because of taking care of my elderly parents and my wife is a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer.
0.883300	To some extent- whatever I don't understand, I just ask questions. 
0.900000	I self diagnosed my self as a hypochondriac. I often visit the doctor for every ache or bump despite having nothing wrong with me. My doctor knows me very well since I visit often and always explains to me why what I think I have, I do not actually have. I feel I have a lot of experience with going to the doctor and asking questions.  
0.883300	English is my first language and I'm of normal intelligence, so I don't see why I would have problems understanding basic health information and services. With respect to obtaining information, most doctors and staff I've met seem quite willing to provide whatever information is requested or needed.
0.705600	Because of my age I believe I am able to comprehend the majority of medical and health related information. However, because of my lack of medical knowledge I feel that I do require help in understanding complicated procedures and technical details.
0.777800	I believe I have a good capacity to make health related decisions.
0.650000	I think that when you are in a position to have face to face time with a doctor or nurse, you are usually not thinking clearly and things go rather quickly and then when you can't think of what you want to ask right that minute they leave and as soon as you are home you start thinking of questions you should have asked. You can alway call and wait for them to get back to you but that always seems like you are bothering them. The internet is usually a good source to do you your own research to get a better understanding of whats going on, assuming you fact check and don't just believe something because some random person said it was true.
0.800000	I feel I am able to do all those things most or all of the time. I ask the questions necessary to make sure I understand while with a doctor or nurse. I also will research information on my own. I will also occasiolly ask friends who are in the medical profession.
0.855600	I have an excellent understanding of the basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.722200	Overall, I feel that I have a pretty good capacity for reading and understanding information in medical settings. I am a bit shy, however, so I have trouble with speaking up and asking all of the questions I should ask. Sometimes more technical information on forms confuses me and I get my husband to help me in that case.  Sometimes I also get him to call the doctor or pharmacist for me with my questions.
0.755600	I think I am able to obtain, process and understand basis heath information easily as I am in the medical field myself. I feel competent in understanding diagnosis as well as doctors orders. I Usually don't have any issues filling out medical forms. 
0.827800	I feel very capable of processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. However I struggle with obtaining information from my healthcare providers because I'm often intimidated by them and don't want to look stupid by asking too many questions. Or oftentimes, the provider will rush through our appointment so I feel as if I would be bothering them by any more detailed questions. 
0.672200	As I get older it is a little bit more difficult to understand certain things when they explain to me.  I usually have to ask twice or three times before I am able to fully understand what they are explaining to me.  Some of the medical terms they use are words I have never heard before in my life, so this is why I can get confused at times. 
0.850000	without understanding i can spoil my health mor so first of all understand the problem well then correct  treatment
0.783300	I believe I'm very capable of understanding most medical information. I feel with the doctors I have had explain much of what is going on with me in plain english. However when I have had doctors in the hospital particularly that were very unhelpful and didn't speak in plain english. So i find the more of the emergency i have been in the harder it has been to make a the high decisions I have to be very trusting. 
0.872200	I think I am fully capable of reading and understanding instructions provided. I may forget to ask a question or two, but I'm confident I could find the answers or contact someone. I am confident in filling out forms and talking to a provider.
0.833300	Although I don't often understand the big words that are used and have had to come home and look some of them up on the internet, the doctors at the clinic I usually go to are pretty good about answering questions and putting it into terms that I can understand. The nurses at the clinic and the hospital are also willing to answer questions to help me understand. And even though I sometimes have felt that I am not sure about making the right decisions I trust the doctors to help me make an informed decision.
0.866700	I feel that I am perfectly capable of understanding most basic health information. But sometimes things can be a little convoluted or confusing and you want someone there with you who can confirm what you heard and understood it the same way that you did. It is also stressful when you are dealing with a health condition and you might miss something while you are worrying and thinking about your health, so it's helpful to have someone along with you to get any information that you might miss.
0.800000	I due tend to understand most medical information, and info presented to me, if I dont I can find a way to figure it out.
0.866700	I think that I am able to understand the instructions fairly well. If I have any questions I ask my doctor directly or I follow up with the office after I leave.
0.755600	I have the capacity to obtain and process but the problem is, in my opinion, that there are so many conflicting claims about treatment, about the quality and efficacy of medication, and then loss in meaning when dealing with doctors/nurses who don't speak your language as a first language, that getting through the health care system these days is almost an active minefield.  Or a crapshoot.
0.761100	I know I have the resources to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I may not be able to do so immediately, but with the help of the internet and my wife who is a nurse, I am confident I can understand just about anything I may need to go over with a doctor (non-specialist). Most people can't answer all their own medical questions and I don't think it's fair for anyone to be able to answer medical questions without being given adequate time to look into the questions.
0.855600	I'm not in the medical profession, so I can honestly say that I do need to have some medical information explained to me. I do believe that I'm capable of looking up information about a treatment, diagnosis or medication. I do ask a lot of questions to people providing medical care to make sure I fully understand what is happening and how the treatment options affect me persolly.
0.883300	I feel comfortable seeking medical information and discussing health topics with professiols. Usually can read in office information, talk to health professiols, and/or research information independently.
0.733300	WHEN I GET THE MEDICAL ANTTENTION
0.866700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand a good amount of what doctors or nurses are telling me because I work in the medical field. If I did not, I think it would be much more confusing as a patient,
0.716700	I feel like I have the knowledge and resources to typically find out what I need to know if I have any questions. Understanding and comprehending medical conditions isn't very difficult for me, however many of my issues during my life time have been fairly basic. If i were to leave the doctor's office with questions, I would probably do research online.
0.850000	I feel like I can understand most of what is told to me; I also act as another set of ears for my fiance, who has had a number of health issues lately. I make sure to ask questions on anything that we're not completely clear on, and know when to get clarification when needed.
0.777800	I have a basic understanding due to a few courses in school. I took emt training etc
0.750000	I am perfectly capable in obtaining, understanding and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never needed any help when dealing with these issues.
0.811100	I feel I have a high capacity for understanding health information. I am college educated and have worked in health care for over six years. This gives me an understanding of some basic health knowledge and knowing how the process works.
0.572200	It would help with making sure that it would have a lot of health info, while people are able to have good decisions
0.816700	I make sure I am explained in layman's terms anything I should know about any conditions or symptoms or medicines I need. When I leave the office I am confident I understand throughly and am able to make informed decisions. 
0.850000	I am responsible for my own medical appointments and decisions.  I have learned to be self sufficient in that regard and learn the necessary steps to take care of myself.  I believe I have good health insurance, doctors and a pharmacy that willing to take the time to educate me or answer any questions I have.
0.916700	I have always been proactive regarding my responsibilities as a patient.  A nurse once told me that doctor's don't remember everything so keep them on their toes.
0.777800	I feel pretty confident in my abilities to obtain and process medical information given to me. Occasiolly I will come up with questions after I've already left the office and I'll need to get in contact with them again.. sometimes that causes me anxiety but I can push through it to get the information I need.
0.872200	I feel that I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Just based on my prior experience in dealing with doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers, I am confident in my abilities. Since I am ufraid to ask questions and have helped other individuals become more informed of their healthcare situations, I would not doubt my skills to acquire the information and assistance needed.
0.844400	Completely comfortable with understanding health information and making an informed decision based on it. 
0.661100	I believe I have a moderate capacity. The issue is that I have a very limited knowledge of many parts of the body and how they should function with one another properly. It's sad to say but it's true. So it can be difficult and I can require extra explaining when something is wrong with me.
0.600000	Mostly I can figure stuff out, but there are still a lot of questions that go unswered sometimes.  Although they try to explain things to me I still sometimes have a hard time remembering or understanding them.  Doctor information to me is often complicated.
0.444400	I always ask my husband to accompany me to my doctor's appointment because most of the time I can't remember everything the doctor tells me and I can' understand most of the medical terms.  My husband is a nurse so he always go with me in my appointments.
0.900000	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding health information if I need to. I have no defects of vision, education, memory or any other disability that would impair my capability to acquire any information or to understand it.
0.883300	I feel confident enough to make health decisions.  I have been hospitalized numerous times for Crohn's Disease and partial bowel obstructions along with several surgeries to make me comfortable enough to understand what the health providers have told me.  I also do a lot of research online to understand my conditions and what will happen and what kind of treatment regimen I will take along with the post hospitalization recovery period.
0.794400	I think that I understand and am capable of understanding most of what a doctor or nurse is explaining and if I don't I can ask them to go a little more detail. I feel comfortable asking about things that I'm not quite certain about without feeling dumb.
0.883300	I usually have a good understanding of what is being told to me.  I ask questions when needed and also may look up something about it on the Internet. Then I can make the best decision based on what I have learned about my condition.
0.900000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic information from my doctors. I generally feel like most doctors want their patients to understand what is happening and they speak in a way that things are clear and when they don't I don't mind letting them know.
0.850000	Well I'd rather know than not know so I'm not afraid of asking hard questions and will press if I'm not getting answers that I fully trust or think they might be holding back.  I also think I'm quite capable of understanding my options when explained to me properly as well as of course being able to research my options myself.  All in all I feel quite capable that most of the time I can make good decisions about my health.
0.916700	I feel like I have the capacity to understand health information.  If I ever have any trouble in understanding, I am not ashamed or bashful to ask for further information or a more clear explation from the doctor or nurse.  My husband can look over my paperwork and if he has any questions he will ask me or even call the healthcare professiol.
0.916700	I feel that I am of sound mind and body and am more than capable of making decision in regards to my health. I usually don't have issues with taking medications as prescribed, always have a good understanding of what I should and shouldn't do for my ailments, and have the capability of seeking out information I don't have. 
0.511100	It's hard to say. It often depends on what it's about--if it's psychological, I can understand things a bit better, but with most GPs and such it's not something I'm well versed in
0.916700	I think I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a problem understanding my doctors or forms before. I do not think I need help with this.
0.916700	I am fully capable of processing information from a health professiol.  I am also good at looking up symptoms and I usually am good at figuring out what is wrong.  (For example, my husband had a blood clot in his leg, but I looked it up before he went to the doctor and told him it looked as if it was a superficial clot, and it turned out that is what the doctor said.)  I know that I can go to the doctor for more information when necessary and I know I can get second opinions with serious health concerns. 
0.833300	i feel fairly confident, most persol information is straight forward. Most questions can be asked and understood in the office and i can always do some research on the internet.
0.916700	I have no mental problems that prevent me from understanding the written or spoken word.  I am nearly completely deaf, but my doc speaks louder and it is not hard to hear him.  And if I do not understand something he or the nurse says, I ask them to repeat themselves.  Same goes with any form I am filling out.  If I do not understand the question, I ask.  So, I would say I have 100% capacity to understand information, get information, process said information and make the necessary medical decisions.
0.838900	I feel I have the skills required to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I have proficiency reading and writing in English, which all of my health information is presented in.  I work in the sciences, which helps me to understand more complex terminology as well as have the ability to look up what I don't understand.  I ask for help when needed, and am always open with my doctors even if it is about questioble or embarrassing issues. 
0.800000	I believe that I can understand health information better when told in person rather than reading a pamphlet or brochure. This also offers the opportunity to ask questions so that I'm sure to understand something I may have initially missed. 
0.833300	I feel I'm able to follow and comprehend medical information farely well. Especially, since you can research much of the information online.  I'm pretty good at doing my due diligence.  
0.916700	I feel I have a full capability to process and understand any medical or health information given to me. I know the basics of how the body works, and anything beyond that is not too complicated for me to understand. I feel completely comfortable vigating the health care system.
0.916700	Im typically a detail and fine print person so I always read information thoroughly and if I have a question I ask and build on it if it doesn't make sense to me. An example would be when I had 5 disk fusion surgery on my neck. The Surgeon had given me some pamplets to read that were essentially percentages of improvement. I may have a 20 percent full recovery or 12 percent full use of my right arm or 8 percent no change at all. The percentages made little sense since none left me with a 50 / 50 chance of improvement and I had to ask more questions as to whether this expensive surgery had any upside at all.
0.883300	I believe that I am fully capable of understanding most health information that is given to me by any health professiol. I have the means to research things at home. If I don't understand anything, especially certain terms that I have not heard before, I make sure to ask my doctor exactly what that means.
0.866700	to a high degree, I guess.  I have no trouble understanding the information they present to me.  I also have no trouble looking it up.
0.772200	I am fully capable of understanding and processing basic and even advanced health information but sometimes I may need things to be explained fully to understand certain points.
0.855600	I feel strongly that I have the capacity to find the resources and ensure I understand basic health information and services with regards to myself. I feel I am able to find the information needed and reach a high level of understanding which ebles me to make the proper health decisions needed.
0.805600	For most basic issues, I feel very confident.  However, my experience helping my mother sort through terminology and different specialists for pancreatic cancer taught me that there are definitely areas that I struggle to understand.  Often the shock of whatever was just told to you shrouds your ability to even realize you're not understanding.
0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand what is being explained to me.  However, if there is something I don't understand, I ask them to explain it further.
0.866700	I have complete control over understand what is said or written to me. If I need help, then I ask. But that is rare.
0.833300	Now most providers have online services so I have message them about anything and ask questions 24 hours a day, its all secure with quick replies too so this makes things easy for me. Anything more complicated I can call or visit my provider, usually get a callback same day and an appointment within 48 hours. Health related things are a lot more efficient and accessible than even just 5 years ago.
0.855600	I feel like I am pretty informed and do ask questions about health care options. There are times that my doctor is uble or unwilling to address certain questions (i.e. supplements versus prescription meds; treatment side effects, etc.) and questions go unswered.  But I generally understand information I am given or I am able to find competent online sources to read further and understand.
0.916700	I feel confident answering questions freely. When I ask enough questions I feel more trusting of the doctor or nurse. I also feel capable that if I felt unsure I could seek out other sources to come back to the doctor and further the discussion.
0.827800	I feel I am quite knowledgeable about my health problems and can understand what is said to me
0.805600	I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions. Regarding forms, I sometimes have difficulty remembering family history and accurately describing symptoms but I try my best. Regarding doctors/medical professiols, I try to prepare questions in advance and ask for explations for anything I don't understand. Generally the most difficult part is getting the doctor to answer some basic questions before rushing out. I don't think they're rude, just definitely in a hurry. If there's still things I don't understand, I'll use google or call and talk to a nurse. I might not fully understand everything, but I trust my capacity to make appropriate medical decisions.
0.722200	I think I have the ability to obtain a lot of information on the internet.  I can't obtain information from other people as much as from the internet because I'm not around people much especially medical people and because it's very difficult for me to think of everything if I'm talking to someone so sometimes I don't end up asking anything and sometimes I only ask one or two things that I've already thought a lot about.  I think I can usually understand information on the internet, though I think sometimes both the internet and doctors and nurses don't give much information because they don't think I need to know much.
0.900000	I'm pretty confident with my understanding and basic knowledge of the health information, and I do rely quite a bit on online information, if I didn't understand something even after I ask my doctor, I spend a considerable amount to research more online. It also helps that I have a couple doctors in my family as well as a good friend of mine who is also a doctor (in addition to my own doctor) so I talk to them quite a bit whenever I have questions, although sometimes it can get confusing to get multiple answers from different people at the same time (one may say I need more meds for my cholesterol, another says i don't need that much, etc).
0.722200	I feel like I know my health. I ask what I need in order to understand. I feel adequate enough to explain any problems or deficiencies that I may have.
0.833300	i feel that i am very capable to make my own health decisions. i only have a difficult time when the paperwork gets into legal matters. that's when it gets a little confusing for me. i am quite knowledgeable about medical terminology and procedures. but if i have a question i always ask and if i feel that i need a second opnion i will go and get it.
0.883300	It's easy for me because I'm obsessed with health and fitness (tural bodybuilder since the age of 16). I have no illnesses and pretty much never get sick, so I seldom have anything to process. When the occasion does arise, my tural interest and passion for health causes me to exert more effort to understand and assimilate the information, that's a large part of why it comes easily.
0.916700	I have strong abilities to understand medical information and research things I don't understand so I can ask my medical providers informed questions without wasting their time or mine. 
0.761100	I believe I am knowledgeable enough to understand most basic information. However, I do tend to ask a lot of questions just to make sure I get everything right. Especially when it comes to your health, it is always good to get more information and clarification. 
0.783300	I have full capacity to process, understand and obtain basic health information and services. I do a lot of reading and research and am comfortable learning and processing information.
0.850000	I think I do pretty good in all those areas of health decision making, with one exception. When I am not feeling well, I do sometimes ask for help in understanding the health communications from my doctors and nurses. This was an issue two years ago when I had a fall and a concussion. So I got a lot of healthcare information then, but I was suffering from concussion which made the understanding difficult by myself. Then I had to get help.
0.850000	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Occaisiolly if there is language or benefits that are worded in a confusing manner I can call my benefit provider for clarification. 
0.866700	I listen to the doctor, I sometimes take notes. I ask if I have any questions before they leave the room
0.750000	i think i do but sometimes it is hard to understand what some terms mean but i always find the answer if i dont understand something 
0.750000	I feel I have adequate ability to understand basic health information and services in regards to using it to make intelligent health decisions. My introverted ture makes face-to-face conversations awkward and I tend to avoid them. But I am usually offered ample written material that I can read on my own.
0.916700	I have a good relationship with my doctor.  He is very down to earth, understanding and easy to talk to. I feel comfortable sharing information.  He is good at explaining information.  I have a lot of trust in him and this helps me to make appropriate health decisions.
0.838900	I feel I'm well informed on most medical matters that affect me. When I have questions I usually search the internet first. I view several sites and read a couple articles to get a consensus. 
0.916700	I have an understanding of my medical problems, so I feel that what the doctors recommend, I am able to make a decision.  If there is an option that I am not aware of, I will have the doctor explain it to me.
0.594400	I'm not too well versed on medical conditions and what causes them so I always get a little worried. Insurance and how it relates to health throws a wrench in things 
0.883300	I am very confident about my abilities to read and understand health information. Sometimes I may need help to understand some of the medical jargon used but overall I can do it by myself.
0.883300	I feel pretty confident in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I believe I have a pretty good idea of how to keep myself fit and healthy. If I have any questions for my doctor, I'll ask them. I'm always careful to follow my doctor's advice/orders very carefully. 
0.838900	As far as past experiences go I have always had the capacity to understand.  I feel somewhat confident that I would always be able to do so, however, if I developed something that was out of the ordiry, I might find myself uble to understand.
0.833300	It takes me some effort to get a grasp of medical information provided by my doctors. Some of it is quite confusing. So, I have to trust them blindly without my informed input in the medical decision they make.
0.855600	I think my ability to understand is good and I also have the ability to research answers from places like Mayo Clinic online.  But sometimes I do find it hard to talk to doctors and hard to be able to assess if they understood 'me' as opposed to me understanding them.  I think I'm capable of making appropriate health decisions.
0.661100	I can do as well as the next person i think But when they start talking to fast it can go over my head. I feel I am smart enough to understand most subjects and health care is no different.
0.822200	I feel that I have a good grasp of the terminology often used, and if I don't I feel confident enough to ask questions of my doctor or to search for the definitions of the terminology on the internet.
0.672200	I feel like a normal capacity to understand and absorb basic health questions, if I needed to make an appropriate decision.
0.866700	I feel that I'm pretty good at understanding health information and for the few instances where I'm not completely sure, I ask the doctor questions. So I think that I have a really firm grasp of what I need to know to make a good health decision.
0.833300	In my opinion, I have a high degree of capacity to obtain and coherently process my health information. I've thus far accurately understood my treatment plans and executed effective decisions that have had great outcomes.
0.538900	I feel that some doctors could be better at explaining medical conditions in a way that normal people can understand it. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what they mean, but occasiolly I am too embarrassed to ask what they mean exactly. In that case I will look it up myself later. I realize that it would be better to actually ask the doctor, because the internet is not always the most reliable place to find information. So I feel that I do have the capacity to get the information, but I don't always do it because I feel intimidated by some doctors.
0.755600	I don't need accommodations or help to obtain or process basic health information. However, when I need some specific information usually I find it difficult to obtain it.  Medical pamphlets are general and vague, doctors and nurses are busy.
0.850000	Overall I am confident in my abilities here. The greatest worries come in areas where there is a great deal of conflicting information in circulation, such as on appropriate macronutrient balance for diet. Then I feel I have to fall back on my own judgment rather than that of my own doctor, which is risky.
0.916700	I feel like I have a great understanding of getting and processing the information I need regarding my health. I have no issues.
0.833300	I am very attentive to my Health and always ask questions about different situations when I don't understand. And when it comes to finding additiol information on a particular subject I am either on the internet or ask my doctor if I am not sure.
0.716700	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand my health information by speaking with my doctors and their office assistants, including visits to specialists and labs. Details I may want to investigate are very often found online.  But when it comes to the fincial aspect of healthcare and health insurance I have often been confused and intimidated. The past several years have been much better with the help of the ACA and Covered California; but I am extremely worried that Republican legislation will end all that and allow insurance companies to focus on their profits instead of getting healthcare to those that need it.
0.672200	When I have to make important decisions or feel a little uneasy, I make sure I bring someone with me to help. So if I don't fully understand they can help me.I have no problem asking if I do not understand something.
0.850000	"I have the capability to do all of the above.  The problem comes in understanding the always changing process, being told one thing by one nurse/doctor and being told something else by another.  Sometimes the information presented to read and understand at times reads like its meant for professiols in the field, not the non-medical educated.  I do a lot of asking when big medical words are used ""what does that mean"".  Sometimes I feel like I'm just supposed to understand and process what they want me to!  My health is good enough and I'm educated enough to understand most, but people like my mom have no clue and just go on whatever doctors want to do and trust."
0.838900	I can understand health information and make health decision as long as it's not made obtuse by using technical terms or covering pages with legal talk. I can process medical info about as well as any other info. It's just in the medical field they often talk about things that need to be expanded on to fully understand, the mes of medicines and illnesses are not easily understood by regular people, so given a more thorough explation, I'm very confident in my ability to make health decisions.
0.750000	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Generally I can understand most things but sometimes I might need help for the more complicated issues.
0.788900	I have the capacity to make health decisions with occasiol help. I am dealing with several health problems and sometimes my daughter goes with me to the doctor so she can understand what is happening to me medically and what she can do to help. I thank God I have her!
0.888900	I believe I have full capacity to understand and make health care decisions for myself and my family. I can understand most of what the doctors and nurses tell me, and when I don't, I ask questions to clarify.
0.744400	I feel very confident that i can find and understand the information and  needed to make appropriate health decisions. At times when i am home and unsure about certain health related problems, i use trusted health websites or books. Also if i still find it hard to understand i ask my doctor when i see him or consult my friends who are doctors.
0.794400	I think I have this capacity to a high degree. At least on par with others. I also don't hesitate to ask health professiols to explain anything that I don't understand.
0.822200	I feel I have a high capacity in general regarding those questions. I ask so many questions of my Doctor he gets irritated, but I get my answers. :) I believe I understand basic health information, and if I don't there are people I can ask - and an entire internet to search - for answers. Sometimes the official forms are intimidating. I try to take all forms slow and question what I don't understand.
0.500000	To a very high degree
0.811100	I have confidence that I am able to obtain all basic health information. I know there are plenty of people that can explain and help me understand the important information if I need help.
0.838900	To some degree. I do feel like healthcare professiols are able to answer my questions when I see them. The trouble is being able to afford to go to the doctor very often.
0.588900	When it comes to basic health information, I would like to think I know as much as the average person--I at least possess the capacity to understand said information. If worse comes to worse, I can Google it later--after years of practice, I am quite adept at Googling and finding information that I can understand myself.
0.766700	If I don't understand something I ask questions.  I would rather talk with someone than read about instructions or explations of my care.  I feel that after asking questions I am well informed to make decisions for myself.

0.766700	I have the capacity to understand and convey my basic health information
0.844400	I think have a better than average understanding of medical information and general medical knowledge. When it comes to advanced information I can figure out the important things although I sometimes don't understand the technical details. Dealing with basic health information is no problem for me.
0.727800	I feel that with the internet I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions- but that is done on my own time outside of the doctors office. I do not feel that health officials play a key role as more often than not they are rushed and not listening to concerns. If I or another family member are seeking diagnosis, I will give as much information as I know to have but can't say that I have the details or knowledge to know which specific questions to ask. As for documents pertaining to medical procedures or medical information they are often confusing and difficult to understand in the short time allotted. 
0.833300	I have had several minor and a major surgery. Before I make any decision I make sure the doctor or nurse explain in basic language what I need to know. I will also take notes of what I am being told. I will go online and do some research and after that discuss it with my doctor. When filling out paperwork if I do not understand something I will ask questions until I understand.
0.511100	I think I am starting to understand important health information. Before I filly found good health insurance, I ended up reviewing a ton of possible health conditions I could have before filly going to the doctor.  These supposed conditions prepared me for the future conversations I would receive at the doctors. 
0.827800	I feel have an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to help me make appropriate decisions. Sometimes I ask questions for clarification and sometimes I am afraid or hesitant to ask but I think for the most part that is average. I rarely need help filling out forms.
0.722200	I feel I can adequately obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I persolly haven't had many health related issues, but my family has.  My experience in this matter mostly comes from my family's medical history and my wife whom works in a doctor's office.
0.916700	I feel that I have the utmost ability to understand basic health information and services. I am fully confident with my ability and have never needed assistance.
0.844400	I feel as if I have the capacity to obtain or understand most basic health information and services needed to make my own health decisions.
0.944400	I think i hav no problem with any of that
0.727800	For me sometime, it is difficult to understand the hand written explation of health and i need to check with doctor / nurse to clarify again about it. I always ask question if i am unsure about the health situation to my doctor during the visit.
0.666700	I think I can understand the basic health information and services for the most part.  But sometimes the language used I will need some help with.  I don't need help all the time just some of the time.  I think that for most of the time I can do it myself.

0.861100	I feel that I have no problem understanding medical information about my medical information. Not only has this been a problem for me but I have gone to doctors appointments with multiple older family members to make sure someone understands their issues. 
0.688900	I read and re-read all the information.  If I don't understand, I will discuss it with my spouse or other family members.  Then I will ask my Doctor.
0.633300	I think i do a little bit with some help.Some terminology is difficult to understands with wording.With help I can understand it better with help.

0.627800	I feel comfortable. I have more capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.827800	I feel that I can understand most of it If not, I can ask a doctor or pharmacist, or research it on the internet.
0.794400	I feel like overall I can articulate my needs and get the help I need/ understand the basics of the medical care I receive.  I do more often than not withhold some information from my doctor because I didn't want to get a lecture. For example, i am on the keto diet,  which has done wonders for my labs,  weight, etc. Yet when i mention it all I get is how bad it is... It's really frustrating. So i feel like the communication is not there and i often feel rushed and just put to the side in terms of the concerns I have. I'm very information literate and able to understand studies and research results,  so I'm usually mostly put of by my physician's ibility to consider other options or opinions. 
0.761100	I can understand most things concerning health, but rarely ask for help when I do. That is a bad trait on my part.
0.822200	I have access to online information.

0.916700	I feel confident reading and understanding written medical information.  I feel confident that I can understand verbal information a doctor or nurse tells me. I feel confident understanding information a pharmacist tells me. I feel confident that I ask important questions of a doctor or nurse if I am given time.  However, with some doctors and nurses I feel rushed and don't get to ask all the questions I would like to.  This happens more than I would like.
0.833300	I have more than the necessary amount of competency, capacity, and ability to effectively and appropriately obtain, process, and comprehend medical and health related information. This competency has been fortified as a result of my educatiol and professiol background. 
0.794400	i feel like if there is information i'm curious or want to ask about i'm capable enough to get the answers that i'm looking for about my health situation
0.644400	When the information is basic and in lamens terms I can understand it enough to have an idea of what is happening. Most of the words they use to identify medical issues are confusing and even the internet doesn't have a clear answer that I can understand. I sometimes ask my nurse friends if they can help me understand it too. 
0.794400	I feel comfortable reading complicated documents and sifting through insurance information, policies, and procedures. I sometimes lack the confidence to ask the doctor all of the questions I have because I feel bad taking up too much of their time. That is something I need to work on.

0.861100	I feel I am pretty competent to fill out forms and make basic decisions regarding health issues. I feel like I have enough experience in making these decisions that I would trust my judgment. 
0.900000	Given that I recently had to do research to write a paper on mR and learn lots of interesting new things about how R and D are used in cellular structures and that, in standardized testing, my written communication skills were ranked in the 96th percentile I'd have to say that the previous questions hardly apply to me. There is very little that I read aside from articles on physics that I have difficulty understanding.
0.733300	Sometimes when i see a doctor, i have a hard time processing the info. i can't ask the questions necessary to understand what is being told to me, my spouse has to be with me in the room. I believe it is because i am nervous being there, not because i don't understand them.

I also helped both my parents in the last years of their lives with vigating medical information.
0.833300	I think I understand any written material and forms I am given.  Occasiolly I have trouble asking doctors questions because I usually recall them after its too late and the appointment is over.  At that point I usually try to find the answer on the internet.

0.811100	I feel I somewhat have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the info I need to make health decisions. Sometimes, however, I feel rushed and don't think of questions until after I see a doctor or nurse. Other times I feel like I just don't know what questions to ask.

I see a pulmonologist and a regular doctor regularly and always have questions that usually either get answered or I get referred to the appropriate doctor.

0.833300	Reading and understanding health information and services is a full time job!. have trouble understanding words used in health care. In some instances, a word may be totally unfamiliar. In other cases, a word may be familiar, but the i may not understand it in a health care context. For example, upon hearing âkeep your glucose in a normal range,â people know what normal means about a person, and they may have a range in their kitchen, but they may miss the intended concept in terms of health care. Even people who understand the concept may need more information than the phrase provides. They need to be told what glucose measurements are considered normal.
0.866700	I like to think I have excellent reading and comprehension skills.  Most problems regarding the subject at hand have to do with the fact that much, if not most, of the material available is written for those who do not.

0.916700	I feel completely able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The language of health information material tends to be in the simplest form possible while still accurately conveying the necessary information. The great majority of health care professiols that I have dealt with make a point of assuring themselves that I understand the information necessary for decision making. They also invite questions. 
0.811100	I feel like I can handle health information  pretty well.  I have been to hospitals before though with others  mostly, and am usually the one who reads all the paperwork.  I also know where to look for more information.
0.900000	I can understand what I'm told to me by a doctor but when they use terms that I've never heard of before I get them to explain it to me in terms that the everyday person understands. I can understand all the basic info they tell me.
0.800000	I've only got a college education, but despite my setback, I DO understand basic health questions that I'm asked, and can explain what I'm feeling to a medical professiol.

However, I certainly know how to fill out forms and talk to doctors and nurses, and I can read the abbreviations on my prescription labels. 
0.850000	I feel that most of the time I'm aware of what's going on with my medical issues and can communicate that to the medical personnel that I interact with. I do research online to supplement what I learn during appointments as well as to find more information on issues that may not be significant enough to take up a lot of appointment time. Occasiolly I have to interact with a medical professiol who seems to not be paying attention (or seems to dislike me), and I do find that frustrating and tend to not communicate very well in those situations. But overall, I feel pretty confident in my ability to understand and communicate about my medical issues.
0.844400	I've worked in healthcare related fields for most of my life so my medical terminology is pretty good. I'd say I understand what's being told to me more than the average person. 
0.766700	I think I'm perfectly capable of understanding anything a doctor tells me, but sometimes I need to have them clarify the information for me.
0.900000	I have capacity mentally as there is nothing hindering my thinking and reasoning  ability. Moreover, I have great capacity to obtain, process and understanding the information that the doctor or nurse provides me, since the doctors and nurses answer any questions I have for them.

0.788900	I feel almost always I can understand the core concept. Usually, when I'm reading on my conditions and come across a word or phrase I don't fully grasp, I break it down to the basic components piece by piece until I understand it. From doing this awhile ago, It has become easier to pick up on things about my health.
0.850000	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision. It is very likely that resort to more than one opinion and seek out someone to consult with before filizing a decision. 
0.588900	The best formula for making health decisions is to combine the most reliable medical facts with our persol values. These include our beliefs, fears, lifestyle, and experiences, and they all play a role in helping us make decisions about our health.
0.838900	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make an appropriate decisions because the information I receive from my physician/nurse, I usually take that information and do my research. I not only research information that is pertaining to my condition in the US, but in other countries.
0.655600	My doctor is very good about answering all of my questions in the most simple way possible and is very patient about me asking a ton of questions, so I very rarely feel like I don't know exactly what's going on.

0.594400	I think as long as the information is simple I can understand it. I hate when doctors give you the medical term that I cannot pronounce or spell. I try to ask as many questions as possible.
0.855600	I have sufficient knowledge and reading comprehension skills to understand basic medical information. I've also had fairly extensive experience with care issues of family members over many years, so I've gleaned a fair amount of basic medical knowledge.
0.883300	Basic health information is easy. Some of it is common sense. The technical stuff I can get from the internet. The doctor's recommendation is just opinion until I can get it verified. 
0.572200	I think i have a fairly good capacity to retain information. Hearing it from a Doctor, Nurse or even my wife is my best way to get the information. While reading it i often get distracted and lose focus. Same goes for writing and filling out forms. 
0.777800	I choose a doctor after going through online reviews. I make sure that the doctor is an expert in the corresponding field of medicine and has many years of experience. When the doctor prescribes a medicine, I make sure to understand the purpose of the medicine. Also, I go through the leaflet that arrives with each medicine to understand the side-effects of the medicine. I also ask the doctor whether I can heal without the medicine or whether it is mandatory that I take medicine to recover from an illness. If I feel that the doctor is being dishonest, I don't bother to buy the medicines prescribed.
0.822200	I don't go to a doctor very often so I am unfamiliar with their processes. I have a pretty good grip of English so I understand most of what they are saying and usually figure out the rest.
0.788900	I think I can understand most things if they are presented in layman's terms.  If I can't I know I can research things on the internet to get a better idea.
0.883300	I feel like I can  understand basic health information to a very good degree, once in a while I may come across a detail, I need  better clarification 
0.900000	I believe that I have a high degree of ability to obtain, process, and understand the information that I need to make the best health decisions for myself. I read a lot and have a great interest in the subject of health, so doing this is nothing new for me.
0.888900	I have a bachelors degree in Clinical Laboratory Science and I currently work in a genetics laboratory so I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information. Before working here, I worked at a hospital for 10 years and then at a physician's office for a couple of years. I also take yearly courses in the laboratory science to satisfy my CEU requirements for my state laboratory license.   I also feel very confident that I can make appropriate decisions about what services I may need.  If there is anything I don't understand about a condition I have the knowledge to search for the appropriate information and the mental capacity to sift through to gather correct information.  
0.727800	I feel in most situations I am able to understand and process the information that I am given in regards to my health.  There are times though when I do have to ask the doctor or nurse to explain what they are saying to me again to make sure that I understand exactly.
0.766700	I feel somewhat confident.  Some doctors have accents or use medical jargon, which makes it difficult to understand what they're saying.  Sometimes I have to ask a nurse to explain things thoroughly.
0.766700	I am quite literate. I ask physicians questions, instead of being nervous in a medical office and thinking I'll ask someone later. I ask questions about how behaviors could possibly lead to conditions. My mother has worked in the medical field so she helps me. I look up terms online.
0.872200	I am old enough that there aren't many surprises when it comes to my health or in-care services. I routinely do a lot of research when something new comes up.  I have a lot of experience in forgetting to ask the right questions until after the fact.
0.833300	I feel I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I study a lot on health myself, work in the health field at an Assisted Living facility, and have a lot of information available on the internet to assist me in decisions.
0.883300	I think I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions completely. I rarely have any issues when filling out health documents or understanding a medical condition or forms. If I do have any questions, they are always answered and I understand them before leaving.
0.866700	I feel I have a full understanding and capacity to process and understand basic health information and I also can make appropriate health decisions. I have been in many medical situations where I had to fill out paperwork or even having to deal with doctors and ask questions and have then explained things to me .I believe I have perfect understanding to these situations due to associating with it very closely 
0.888900	I have a family doctor whom we go to for any health issues and medical checkup. I will consult her if I need help in understanding the information. If the information is not too complicated, I will google and read more about it to get further information.
0.750000	my father big brother and uncle are pharmacist so i have the environment to understand basic health information at home. i usually ask question to them so i think i have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions.
0.900000	I have access to  most if not all the information I need .. my health care  providers have always answered my questions.
0.672200	I think that I can understand basic health decisions but more info on advantage illnesses when they occur or am told about them. I can gain more knowledge through them and the internet
0.805600	I think I am highly capable of making appropriate health decisions.  Even when doctors are not clear always clear to me, I am able to ask for more information when I feel that it is important that I fully understand what I'm told.  Doctors often spew a lot of medical terminology that not everyone can understand so I often do my own research after and later ask for more emphasis or for advice from friends who are also in the medical profession.   Once I fully process what I need, I then make the changes needed to feel better and healthier.
0.900000	I feel I understand it quite well. If I have a question I don't hesitate to ask someone. Some of it can be confusing at times, always ask if uncertain. So far in me life I have had no problems understanding and processing health information.
0.900000	I believe I have a good degree of competency to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services as to making quality decisions. Having had some prior medical conditions, I am somewhat experienced to the scerios described in the prior questions. Overall, I am pretty confident dealing with various sources of health information and services but will certainly ask or research myself for better clarity/understanding if something is unclear or I need information about how something should be properly done. 
0.588900	I can do my best.  I know english obviously however there are ideas and concepts I may be missing out on.  An experts time and input is appreciated.
0.794400	There is an Internet to search for the information (i.e. medical terms, conditions, symptoms, ... etc..) and knowledge to read and learn. My physician will explain my illness and the treatments options when the tests results came out. Of course, I may ask any questions to my doctor. There are plenty of doctors to let you have the second opinion. I believe that most of people can make appropriate health decisions as long as you have a clear mind and know how to read and write because everyone concerns about their health conditions very much unless they give up.  
0.644400	I have limited capacity to obtain health information because it depends on others. I can process and understands basic health information especially if provided in layman's terms.
0.800000	I am really good at understanding information but I am not good at asking appropriate questions because I feel like I do not get good answers.
0.900000	I like to read about medical issues so I am used to the medical terms. I don't need any help.
0.672200	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand health information most of the time, but require assistance if things are overly technical. I have no problem in asking the nurses or doctors to explain information until I understand, and I often go online after an appointment to read-up further on my options. I feel that I have all the tools I need to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.583300	I believe that i have enough understanding of health information to make a judgement or decision concerning my health. If i do mot understand something i will either look it up, or ask questions about it
0.855600	if i dont understand something i usually just pull it up on my phone. i dont try to look for anything other than what it means, i then if i dont know exactly i ask the doctor or look for more indepth info
0.705600	I ask anything I do not understand. My doctors and nurses are informative and helpful.
0.916700	I believe I have a high degree of ability in regard to basic health information. I understand quickly, feel comfortable asking for clarification and am able to research on my own if need be.
0.788900	I think I can do it just fine. I am a native English speaker and I also currently work for a company that provides health services anyway.
0.577800	I think I can process the information fairly well, I'm not a doctor but I do like to know the medication I'm receiving and I will do research about it online.
0.850000	I always fill out my own information. I do a lot of research on conditions I have so that I am educated. I have PTSD and fibromyalgia. I fill out a lot of forms. I also am a Therapeutic Support Staff so I do a lot of paperwork involving data collection and personal information so I have to know what I am doing.
0.833300	I believe that I have a great deal of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as I have learned a lot from my wife(she is a nurse), I always ask questions from the health provider if I don't understand something. I also have the internet to find out the meaning of something.
0.900000	I am perfectly capable of researching my own health conditions and being fully prepared to deal with them with a doctors help. I have questioned my doctors diagnoses before based on my own research. And it turns out I was correct. 
0.916700	I can do everything I need to make health decisions. I understand documents,treatment plans, etc very easily. And if I don't I know what questions to ask and what research I can do on my own.
0.916700	I feel I have the adequate knowledge to understand what the doctors//nurses tell me. If I do not understand something, I have them elaborate more on it, so I do understand. Otherwise, I am pretty good at understanding the medical reports given to me.
0.588900	I feel capable
0.916700	I have the capacity to listen carefully and to try my best to interpret what the information means to me personally. If I do not understand I will ask to have it explained in more detail. I also am in touch with reality and what is or is not possible as far as medical treatment. In other words I tend to keep unrealistic expectations in check.
0.883300	I have an environmental engineering background so am comfortable reading about technical issues.  I am also an inquisitive person so I am comfortable researching topics. 
0.916700	I am an intelligent and discerning person capable of understanding medical explanations, I have a mature understanding of biology, physiology, and medicines, and am highly confident that I can learn and utilize my skills to obtain any pertinent knowledge that I should have regarding my own health and diseases.
0.827800	I think I have the basics pretty much down. I can understand most concepts, I am able to fill out forms without anyone else and I make sure to clarify with the doctor when I need to. I am confident in my ability to make appropriate health decisions
0.872200	Overall I feel pretty confident. However, sometimes I don't think of the best questions to ask the healthcare professional while I am meeting with them. Sometimes I dont' think of the best questions until after I have already left.
0.883300	I'm experienced enough that I've accumulated significant knowledge already. I can always access my health providers website or ask my doctor if I have questions. There are also thousands of websites providing an abundance of information. I have watched many hours of medical television and have become familiar with medical terminology.

0.883300	I know how to find the answers to my questions if I have any via web, medical professionals and friends. 
0.827800	I have all or most of the necessary abilities in terms of being able to understand what's being communicated to me. However, my issue is more that, sometimes, I do not seek medical advice because I have other priorities. Alternatively, I really value my privacy and might feel like I do not want others telling me how to act, regardless of their expertise. 
0.916700	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do so. I can easily read and understand most medical literature and I know what information to seek out and what questions to ask. I also feel confident about my ability to conduct independent research online or anywhere else.
0.850000	I am willing to do whatever research is necessary to make sure I fully understand the situation. I fell that when I make a decision it is based on the best information available. 
0.900000	I for the most part understand the basic health information that is presented to me. And i am also confident in making a executive decision towards my health. 
0.916700	I'm very confident. I worked as a surgical tech for 10 years and have a degree in biology so I'm well versed in medical research and how to understand it and comfortable with medical terminology.
0.855600	I don't really have issues with this. I have relatives who work in the healthcare field so if I do have questions, I just ask them. I am confident filling out forms and almost never have to ask for help.
0.916700	I am positive I have the capacity to understand and process basic health information and even beyond that to make appropriate health decisions. I am a registered nurse working towards my master's and am confident I understand what my doctor tells me 100% of the time.
0.627800	I think I have just about average ability. Sometimes the information is overwhelming. Sometimes when I ask logical questions about things that do not make sense, the answer I get it medical science does not work logically. I question and read about what my health interests are but in the end chose to listen to the doctor even though I may not agree as they are the experts.
0.916700	I know and am confident I can understand everything health related; if there is something I do not understand, I have no problem asking a health professional to explain it to me
0.916700	I think I have the intelligence to handle any medical terms. I'm also good at researching, so anything I don't understand I will look up. I don't hesitate to ask questions. I will also get a second opinion on whatever my GP tells me from a close friend who is a doctor in another state. I will also question him about anything I'm not clear about.
0.900000	The internet is a big factor in staying informed. People tend to overestimate a doctor's knowledge. Much information can be found on the internet about basic medical info.
0.833300	I can understand health information. I research anything I want to know on my own and I find that most doctors are just crap shooting and don't really know or care to help. I make decisions on my own based on what I feel is right for me. 
0.866700	Im well educated and smarter than the average bear.  Im also willing to ask for clarification (or do my own research) if something is unclear.
0.916700	I feel like I am fully capable of making appropriate health decisions. 
0.677800	I have a good understanding on basic health information and feel that I can make decisions to make appropriate health decisions. I normally have a good understanding of doctors and nurses and can get what they are saying.
0.883300	I have lots of resources to understand the health information I need. I simply ask my medical providers questions and they tend to answer them in depth. I tend to do research on the internet before a doctor's visit and I write down my question in advance. I also signed up to have access to my medical records/lab results online. I have researched my lab results (numbers) to get a better understanding of my health.
0.900000	I have a smartphone and a computer at my disposal. Any and everything that a Dr or nurse says is completely researchable and verifiable on the internet or in books.
0.850000	I am usually pretty good at keeping pace with medical forms. If I have a question I simply ask. If jargon is used I am not familiar with I just google it.
0.916700	I feel that my capacity/ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information/services to make appropriate health decisions is more than sufficient. I have no problem digesting even relatively complex information about health issues, symptoms, treatment. If I have any questions about information, I have no problem whatsoever communicating with the relevant health care provider in order to obtain any needed clarification. I am also rather vigilant about communicating any questions or concerns I may have when I don't understand information being relayed to me by a provider, as well as when informing them about my own issues or various respective symptoms. I don't know what else to say. The process is pretty clear to me & in the odd exception that it's not, the process of how to obtain clarification is clear. 
0.738900	I have the internet. It can help me understand anything. 
0.633300	I feel like I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information.
0.827800	I feel that I have the capability and if I am struggling, my mother has a health background to provide additional needed information.
0.761100	based on prior research i think i can properly understand the basics.  i feel that my doctors and my own research helps me with this endeavor
0.827800	I feel like I have a high degree of capability to obtain and understand health information. There are an array of different resources available, in addition to being able to speak with my doctor or get a second opinion. 
0.794400	I consider myself a pretty intelligent person. I always make sure that if I do not understand something I ask for clarification. Your health is the most important thing in your life because without it you are miserable. 
0.883300	I think I have enough of a knowledge base to make informed opinions about my condition after doing some research and consulting with my doctor. If I have questions when my doctor is explaining something I make sure to ask them. I usually do my own research and ask the doctor what they think about my conclusions. 
0.822200	I started to get my own medical records because I wasn't getting all of the information that they were writing about me. So it helped me understand what they were thinking of me, and what I needed to do to get them to understand. I do have to google a lot of the wording on copies of MRIs because no one really tells me what came up on the scans.
0.844400	I studied Medical Office Technology in college which included classes in medical terminology. I had to learn a lot about different medical procedures and afflictions. I've always read about my level, and I read rather fast. I know I can understand what I read. If I can't, I know how to get online and look up what I need. I also know a few medical personnel I can call and ask to explain something to me.
0.827800	i use the internet to find out more info about hat a doctor has told me. i usually think of questions i leave. 
0.644400	I have had a grandfather who had a lot of health issues and helped him with his forms and dealing with the doctor. I also have a couple of health related issues that I have had to deal with so I understand most of what I learn.
0.850000	Well, if anything is confusing to me, I can just ask a doctor or a nurse. I can also use the vast internet to find answers to my questions as well as find people online to discuss medical issues/decisions that I might be faced with -- people who face the same things. I can seek advice from those people. For the most part, I am confident I can and do understand information relevant to my health.
0.883300	I think I have a good understanding of basic health information and services needed to make appropriate decisions. When I've went to the doctor in the past with any issues I'm always very inquisitive and helpful with my doctor to pinpoint what exactly the issue is. 
0.777800	I think I am pretty capable of understanding basic health information. There are many resources online that can help clear up and misconceptions with medical terminology.
0.916700	I feel like I have a basic understanding. If I don't get a basic understanding or if something is confusing I'm fine with asking questions. It I'm still unable to understand there's always Google and a billion people who have the same exact questions as I do so its fairly easy to figure out what something means if you have internet access.
0.711100	I think that I have what it takes to understand the information given to me by my doctor. But there are still times when it is a bit cloudy in trying to understand all the variables. When I don't completely understand the information, I either go to an online forum or ask a friend. 
0.916700	When I became an adult I never needed help filling out forms. My mom always helped me when I was younger understand what information on the forms meant if I had a question. 
0.866700	I feel I have a good ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information so I can make health decisions. I have never run into a problem at my doctor's office or medical facility where I was confused about any particular thing.
0.538900	It's pretty good, I don't think I need too much help. It's fine.
0.811100	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do this. I'm competent and can research things I'm not familiar with. 
0.844400	I understand most and if I don't, I will google it and look up information to be sure I get all in the information i need and want and make sure I understand it all.  I will always research any kind of medical issue I may have and will question my dr. if my research and their opinions differ.  I want to be sure I get the best medical care I can with all the information I can gather about medical/health issues.
0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to understand health information. The internet is a wonder resource to learn more about health information and services pertaining to my health decision. I still believe a doctor should be your number one source and you shouldn't believe or trust everything you read online.
0.888900	I think I'm educated and knowledgeable enough to understand the health information given to me generally. I'm health conscious, exercise and take supplements which I look into. I think my knowledge through experience and that I've picked up through life is sufficient.
0.572200	I have everything ready available for me online. I do also have  my doctor on had close to me to help me understand information.
0.916700	as a nurse, i feel i have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself and my family.
0.916700	I have access to the internet and can look up information. I can ask doctors for a second opinion. I am very skeptical and cautious in general. I also believe that having a medical degree doesn't automatically make you any more intelligent than the average person and certainly doesn't make you the alpha and omega of medical knowledge. Like in all fields and occupations, there are mediocre people.
0.872200	I think I can make appropriate health decisions because I'm always willing to ask questions and if I don't personally agree with a treatment option, I challenge it or get a second opinion. It's my health, and I have the right to ensure I'm getting the best possible care. 
0.361100	iTHINK BASED ON THOSE QUESTIONS that I can make a good decision regarding my health. Bring it on!!
0.844400	I have no problem understand what my doctor tells me. But he like pills, and i don't so we disagree but I still take what he tells me to
0.900000	I have no problem understanding complex information.
0.916700	I feel that I have the knowledge base and critical thinking skills to make heath based decision, in part because I am a part of the profession
0.616700	I think I have a better ability than most to learn about my illnesses. I have been chronically ill with several rare diseases for years now and I tend to have to look up medical studies on my own time to get more knowledge about how to help myself heal. 
0.844400	I eel that I am very well capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information. Perhaps it's a mix of my intelligence and the knowledge I already have mixed with having good luck in the information being explained to me in an easy way. 
0.694400	I believe I understand most things, sometimes I get frustrated when filling out forms regarding insurance information because I don't fully understand that sort of thing.
0.833300	I believe I have perfect capacity to obtain basic health information and services that I need to make decisions.  I am a literate person that is not shy about asking questions.
0.550000	My parents raised me to understand things that I read. I am very educated and I can learn to do things on my own without other peoples help.
0.672200	I feel I have the capacity to understand and retain most basic health information. It is harder to retain services as I live in America where health is expensive and hard for anyone that is not rich.
0.811100	"I would give myself a ""B+"".  I understand just about everything, but when they start using very medicals terms / lingo I may start to not understand as well.  Sometimes I do not like to ask because I think it may make me look stupid, but I should not care because it is my health we are discussing."
0.466700	I feel like with the terms and complicated medical lingo, I am not exactly sure what some of the meanings entail. Such as If I am diagnosed with a certain condition and need medication X, I don't know what that medication does, what the alternatives are, I don't even know how to pronounce some of these names. I feel like I am able to ask the doctors but can not fully grasp the magnitude of the situation without looking at the whole picture which is difficult to have someone explain to me in one visit. I feel like I need  a step by step diagnostic, of why this happened, what I can do, what the consequences are, what some definitions of the disease are, etc. 
0.788900	I have worked on the administration side of healthcare for about 10 years. I work with medical terminology on a daily basis so I feel quite comfortable and have people to ask. 
0.916700	"I've been with my doctor for about 10 years and I trust him completely. I feel very open and honest with him. I tell him everything and do not fear judgment when I ask a ""stupid"" question."
0.605600	I believe that I have the capabilities to make health decisions for many reasons. First off, the internet is so big today and full of information that anybody can go there to get valuable information on any topic.
0.572200	I have the basic understanding to take action when I need to when it comes to important issues like my own health.
0.827800	I think that I have the capacity to understand health information and services. The doctors I see are helpful and informative, and so are their staff members. I usually find health information pretty clear and easy to understand, but if I do need help, I know there is someone I can go to.
0.888900	I feel like I am able to understand everything that I need in order to make informed decisions about my health and whatever choices or options I need to make related to them. I don't require assistance from others to understand.
0.850000	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on understanding the various aspects of healthcare. I make sure to read materials thoroughly and, like with contracts, I always make sure to read fine print and ask questions about things I do not understand. The internet allows me to do basic research on things I might need to ask or clarify. I trust my doctors to provide me with the proper information and I trust them to explain things to me in terms that I can understand.
0.866700	I feel like a have a high degree ob ability to obtain and understand the necessary information. Occasionally my memory and reading comprehension will be much lower than average, and I require some help to get through things.
0.833300	With the internet these days it's usually not too hard to figure something out if the front desk is too busy. I had testicular cancer a few years back and practically lived at the Urologists. I figured out what most of their doctor words meant pretty quickly. 
0.850000	I feel very comfortable when dealing with my own medical concerns and obtaining the correct information. I have studied Exercise Science in college and spent a lot of my time during college going to the doctors on my own so I learned quickly what was expected of me and of the doctors to make sure I understood everything and took care of my health properly.
0.705600	i think that i do. i graduated college and i have known english all my life. i have taken many english courses
0.827800	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. There are times when doctors may use terms, medications, procedures, etc. that I don't understand, but I always ask them to please explain. 
0.761100	I think as long as someone is good at explaining it I can usually comprehend most of it. I guess I t would depend on what was being discussed
0.866700	Well, I have the internet available as a tool if I find myself in any confusion regarding a diagnosis, medicine dosage, symptoms, side-effects, etc.  My sister-in-law is in the medical field as well, and can explain things.
0.722200	When it comes to just myself I am confident that I can make the right decisions. Sometimes I may forget my insurance plan numbers or something else but I can definitely ask questions without issue. So even if I am unsure or confused I have no problem making sure I understand before I leave. 
0.666700	I think I'm probably average. Sometimes I feel a bit uncomfortable asking too much because Doctor's always seem to be in a rush. If I am comfortable with a Doctor then I am much more likely to obtain and understand the information I need or should have.
0.900000	I believe I am able to understand the health information I need to to make appropriate decisions. I can read well and have an educational background in health sciences. I also know how to use the Internet to look up information.
0.883300	I feel I have all the options and services I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I often ignore going to the doctor because they don't value my time and make we wait too long in the waiting room
0.900000	I feel that I am above average at processing health information.  I know what to ask when I am unsure about something.  I have a degree in nursing, so I understand almost everything that I encounter related to my health.
0.716700	I think with technology the way it is now, I have much better access to information that can help me understand what i need to make decisions.
0.850000	I feel I have the capacity to do all of that to a high degree. I do not think that it is very complicated at all. I have confidence in my ability to handle all of the above with little to no trouble. I think I would be able to handle it at any given time.
0.738900	I feel I know enough to assess my health. I do a lot of research, and I seek info on things I don't understand. Any sudden changes to my help usually prompts a call to my doctor. I have a great doctor; she explains everything in great detail for me. Usually it's no big deal, but she appreciates the concern I have for my health.
0.672200	I feel that If I am unable to figure something out than either my wife or possibly a close friend who is a registered nurse is always there if I have questions or flat out just don't understand what I am looking at
0.777800	"I think that I do have the capacity to process and understand basic health information.  Sometimes it gets very confusing and I'm not sure what questions I should ask in order to be fully informed.  I often find that the doctor is telling me information and I am just nodding and saying ""ok"" because I am not sure what other information I might need to know in order to make the proper decisions."
0.888900	I am able to understand most health information and am confident that I can research and learn things that I do not already know when it comes to health information. It is all well within my ability to know.

0.777800	I believe I have a good understanding of health information. Sometimes, doctors try to give a lot of information at one point, but I believe I can understand what they are saying. This is helped by having written material as well.

0.850000	I am intelligent person who knows what to ask questions. I feel like I am extremely capable of processing most medical information. That being said, there are times when information given to me about my health is very technical and complicated. In these instances, I'm a bit less confident.
0.600000	Average, I think. If there's something I don't understand, I'll research it myself or ask someone with the medical knowledge I need. Sometimes there's a need for a second opinion, and I generally go with gut-instinct about which advice to follow.
0.855600	I usually follow what they're saying. If I know in advance I'll write my questions down. A lot of the time if I don't do that I'll have additional questions later.
0.822200	I beleive that I have a high ability to understand. I am a caregiver to my father who has a lot of health problems and I was once to my mother as well (5 years). I am the go to person for this type of thing in my family.
0.916700	I don't have any problems understanding what doctors tell me.  I usually look up things before hand so that I am well-informed.
0.855600	I feel that I can understand most of what I am presented as far as health information.

I have access to the internet and to people who can help me when needed.

0.866700	I feel I can obtain and process health information. While I am not a doctor, I am currently in graduate school getting my Phd in drug delivery and nanomedicine, thus I have a science background. When I need further clarification, I read or ask my doctor, I also have two nurses in my family that I can ask any question I need. 
0.811100	I feel I am quite competent to read, process, understand and utilize information that is provided to me in a written format. Sometimes when I am given verbal instructions, I like to have another person with me because Iâm afraid I wonât remember everything correctly.

0.916700	I've never had a problem reading any health related documents. I have a bachelor's degree in a health related field so it's usually second nature to me. I have many friends and even family members who also work in the health field that will help me if I need anything. If I don't understand something I either ask or search on google.
0.711100	I have the capacity to understand the basic decisions that need to be made in health matters. I run into trouble when it comes to weighing different choices that have to be made that could have different outcomes. For instance, choosing between different treatment options with different side effects. When a doctor will not give a strong recommendation either way it can be challenging

0.900000	I feel like I have everything I need to understand doctors and nurses about my current health situation. If I need help with something I always have google and family and friends to turn to.
0.916700	I believe I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services. I have maintained a healthy lifestyle and do not have any health problems. I have done so by listening to my doctor when I have been sick or had complications with certain things.
0.638900	I think I can handle it with a little help, there is always the option to ask for help, specially from the doctors and nurses, and based on all the info I can take an appropriate health decision.
0.850000	It's not that hard to obtain and process medial information. I just have to tell my doctor everything I can and remember that there is always more I could say. I try to be accurate and thourough with the information I provide.
0.855600	I believe I do a sufficient job in understanding basic health information and making appropriate health decisions. This may due to my above average knowledge of the general medical field as I have taken college courses regarding health and medical services.
0.855600	I feel that I have enough knowledge to care for myself and understand the information that the doctors may present to me. I am not worried about not having anyone with me at anytime for any medical reasoning.

I think in most cases I am able to ask appropriate questions in order to make good health deciions
0.916700	I think I have as much capacity as anyone could have.  I hardly ever get sick and have never had a major illness luckily.  Neither has my daughter.  I can easily fill out forms for myself or my daughter when needed.  We are very fortunate to be extremely healthy and very rarely do we need the services of a doctor.
0.900000	I feel that I have done enough self research that I can understand most anything that I need to as far as health information and services go. If I don't know something, I would most likely research it myself instead of asking someone else for help.
0.655600	I feel that I can do most of the information, but you there is usually information that is obscure. I think just making medical questions basic and simple would be much more helpful.

Although sometimes I am unable to fully understand or fill out forms, when explained to, I generally end up understanding everything after I get some help. 
0.488900	In general, I know some information and details about the health related services. It could be improve my knowledge. I want seen many information about the health related service. I take more time in google search for this kind of information. 
0.555600	I always feel when I go to my doctor that they really do not seem to care about what is going on with me, therefore they do not really explain all the details on what I need to do t make my condition better. Or they just give me the run of the mill answer, not really getting to the root of the problem.
0.861100	For myself, I feel fully capable of understanding all basic health information at all times. If I do not udnerstand something, I make it a point to get in contact with the most appropriate professional who is qualified to answer my questions; it is not difficult to do so.
0.622200	I have the ability and capacity to achieve and process, but hospital and medical settings are intimidating and there are times when I find that I just want to be out as soon as possible, even if that means not asking questions or understanding.
0.883300	My Mom is a registered nurse and I took Pre-Med Bio in school so I am used to medical jargon and biology. I can also sometimes self-diagnose or know of similar conditions. I also know what my family genes means for my own conditions.
0.861100	I'm fairly health, college educated and I trust my ability to understand documents. I'm of sound mine and confident that I can read forms and if I do have questions find the answers via online search or through a health care provider or their staff. 
0.683300	I think I do. Sometimes I don't quite understand how to fill out the forms, because the forms are different depending on the place you are at. My last appointment the forms were different a bit, and I signed in the incorrect place, and they had to redo them. 
0.916700	I'm comfortable enough with my doctor to where I have no problems asking questions about my health, and any test results I have been administered. I also know how to look up information, in regards to bettering my health, no matter what it is.
0.750000	I feel as if I have the capacity, but sometimes not the time to look up certain terms. I am still occasionally shy as well about interacting with healthcare professionals because I am not used to it which makes me hesitant to sometimes clarify things on the spot.
0.600000	For the most part I have the necessary skills and means to understand and process information that is told or presented to me. Depending on my mental state I might need someone else to look over it or ask important questions for me.
0.900000	I feel like I do. In August I was diagnosed with epilepsy, so in the past 6 months I have visited a neurologist, as well as had an MRI/ Cat Scan performed. I had no issues regarding the info I was given. If I do not understand something, I will ask questions.
0.861100	I think that my father did a pretty good job in all of my doctor's visits as a child to be able to understand what to do during visits so that I'd be able to go by myself when I got old enough. In general, I know my family's history and some of the specific issues that I want to double check with my doctor to make sure there are no issues there (cancer and heart issues). I know enough about services for the one issue I have with colitis and can adequately ask about that. I know where to go on the internet to get more information if something is unclear to me.
0.900000	I feel I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I think I have 100% capacity to obtain, process, and understand all my basic health info and services need and I am currently able to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.916700	I have grown up around doctors and hospitals. My mother was very sick when I was a child. It makes it where I am use to the lingo and feel very confident in my ability to understand what doctors are saying.
0.883300	As long as I am clear and understand what they are telling me I'm okay.  If I have questions I am not afraid to ask because if I do not I can not make an enducated decision.
0.811100	I definitely have the capacity. I have a moderately high level of understanding of what I'm read and am told, and I have the agency to be able to make my own decisions about my health.

0.822200	I am rather confident that I have the ability to do so. There are some questions I'm unsure about, specifically questions that might pertain to past injuries sustained in sports and that could be affecting me at the time. I don't have any medical school background but I make sure to ask as many questions as necessary to satisfy my curiosity about my medical issues almost every time I go to be seen by a health professional. I also feel that most health professionals in our area are competent and have the patient's best interest in mind.
0.655600	I think I have a pretty good idea about it, but with the issue of insurance, it makes the whole process a lot more harrowing. I understand what doctors tell me and have a general idea of what to fill out on health forms, but there are times when that intersects with insurance and I'm at a complete loss
0.622200	I think i have a pretty good understaning of how to translate medical materials from a dr point of view to that of an average joes point of veiw without much of an issue.
0.722200	i like the doctors that i go do. if there is anything that is in writing and i am not understanding they are willing to sit down and explain things no matter how long it is going to take then to explain. If the doctor is there and the nurse needs further help he is going to do the same thing to assist. the hospital always wants to make sure the patient is well aware of their diagnosis the medicine was was given and the amout of what needs to be taken. 
0.883300	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to know, after an appointment with a medical professional. If I do not understand something, I have no problem asking for more explanation. I never leave with unanswered questions or not understanding the information given to me.
0.888900	I feel that I can fully obtain and process all the information that I need.  I make sure to ask for clarification and don't leave until I am satisfied that I have gotten the answers I need.  I've never had a problem with understanding my doctor.

If im having a procedure done i make sure i fully understand what is happening and what is suppose to happen. 
0.916700	I feel that I am able to comprehend basic and advanced medical information that would be needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I generally understand any information given to me and I am able to ask for any help if I do not understand.

0.805600	I feel like I should understand what I am reading.  I feel I have the capacity to understand what is being asked of me.  I went to college and should understand the terminology of the forms.  
0.844400	I ask questions when I don't understand the information I am given, and I make sure that I am given all the information I need to better understand my choices in order to make a well informed decision
0.800000	I feel I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services to make decisions about my health care. I can also use Google to look up any conditions or medications and get more information about it that way also if I dont understand something. I am not afraid to ask my doctor for certain medications I think I may need and discuss my health issues with him. 
0.900000	I can understand basic health information because I am a nurse. I am used to dealing with medical information and doctors on a daily basis. I also have an extensive background in terminology and know how the body works. This gives me a lot of knowledge to where I don't need to ask the doctors or nurses questions. 
0.844400	I feel confident in my ability to understand information and services to make decisions for my health care. If I don't understand something I will try to ask questions or I will look it up later or talk to one of my friends in the health care profession.

0.411100	I believe that I am able to do the things that I need to do and that is why I do the things that I need to do to make sure that I get things done.
0.838900	Sometimes I don't always ask a question for fear of sounding a bit stupid but the older I get, the more information I want regarding my health. I think I am fairly healthy except for the fact that since the age of 17 I found out I have NF1
0.766700	I feel as though I have a very good understanding of medical processes and health decisions because I do my research and know the general jargon that these professionals use. I tend to do research on things I don't understand so that I know what decisions to make.

0.572200	i have learn biotechnology so that i can knew some information about the medical and health terms but in some cases i have to clarify with the doctor
0.900000	I believe I have above average capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.633300	I feel that I my ability to understand basic health information is a 100%. I often feel that my doctors don't spend enough time explaining to me, what my condition is which makes me feel that they don't understand my condition very well at all.
0.511100	I don't really understand anything related to health information, because I have trouble understanding technical words and I rarely make healthcare decisions.
0.916700	As a retired RN, I am well versed in the field of healthcare.  I am able to research any topics or findings I am unfamiliar with and, I hold health care providers accountable for the quality of care they provide.
0.816700	I feel fully capable of obtaining the information I need to make informed decisions on my health. Having worked in the medical software profession has helped me quite a bit with it.
0.827800	I feel quite confident in my ability to understand basic health information and then use it to make health decisions.  I'm not shy about asking doctors or nurses to explain something if I want more information or feel I don't understand it.  Sometimes I might not ask all the important questions, or think of them at the appropriate time, but usually I'm okay about that.  And I find that doctors and nurses typically do a good job of explaining things anyway, which makes my role easier.
0.677800	I do have the capacity to obtain and process the information that is given to me to make appropriate health decisions. It can be sometimes confusing if the doctor doesn't explain it or uses words I do not know which makes me confused about the topic. Otherwise, though I can often obtain all the information and when they give you sheets or directions on paper often helps with the refreshment of memory and is sometimes better explained.
0.694400	I feel as if for the most part I am able to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The only time I might need help is if it goes in depth to terms I wouldn't understand.
0.811100	I feel like in general I do have that capacity. Sometimes I don't understand technical details though, which can lead to misunderstandings. I usually ask questions or for help but sometimes I am too embarrassed to do so.
0.744400	I have access to all services needed to understand my health. My doctor will answer all question and for anything i dont understand&lt; i can do a web search and there are a plethora of articles that will help me
0.577800	If you are like most people, you have opportunities to initiate difficult conversations on a frequent basis, but they probably donât really feel like âopportunitiesâ,  we are using the term âdifficult conversationsâ to convey a situation where both parties in the conversation need to stay in a relationship, the stakes are high, opinions vary and emotions may run strong. At work, situations may arise between you and your supervisor that call for you to initiate a difficult conversation. Your supervisor may be many things, but it is doubtful s/he is a mind-reader. 
0.822200	I feel like it is completely within my capacity to obtain basic health information and services. However, it is a bit more difficult to always process and understand that information. I feel like the last few times I saw a doctor, the appointment was extremely rushed, and did not allow me the time to ask all of the questions I had about the information I'd received at those appointments. My doctor gave me print-outs, which were a little helpful, but felt like a lazy way of ensuring that I was provided with the information I needed. I ended up having to do online searches at home to fully understand everything that was discussed at my appointments.
0.661100	Iâm the type of person who asks a lot of questions and will openly say âI donât understand any of thisâ, so assuming health professionals can answer my questions, Iâll get all the information I need. 
0.866700	I think I have the full capacity to understand basic health information. I've done a lot of reading over the years, and I'm also capable of looking things up online or on my phone if I need to understand it in plain talk and can't get my doctor to explain it.
0.627800	I would say so. Doctors sometimes talk in hard to understand ways.It is some times hard to tell if it is on purpose or not. Sometimes you wonder if doctors are about numbers
0.827800	I feel confident in my ability to understand most health materials I'm given, as well as my ability to articulate concerns and ask questions.
0.916700	I have no underlying issues with reading comprehension, with memory retention or with medical terminology that would preclude me from understanding basic health information provided to me by a doctor or hospital. I recently went for a physical with my doctor and was able to fully understand all her questions to me and instructions given to me. 
0.794400	As a former Nurses Assistant and Med Tech i feel i have an above average understanding of medical terminology and practices.
0.600000	I believe that nowdays we have a lot of information provided for our health. It is possible to check every symptom and to get to know if there is something wrong with your health and the ways to stop it. I think that medical advice is however very neccessary and very useful.
0.850000	Although I don't know much about the medical profession, I am typically able to grasp articulate explanations regarding the medical aspects pertinent to my well-being. If I don't understand something, I either ask for clarification or research it myself. I'm pretty bright most of the time.
0.783300	I have no problem answering or asking questions regarding my health. Growing up, my mother was a nurse so I was often around medical jargon. Even when in college, though I am not in the medical field, I enjoyed taking health and nutrition and anatomy classes. I also feel that I have the resources that if I have questions, I can speak up and find someone to help me make the most appropriated decision for my well being.
0.838900	I feel that I have enough basic knowledge to understand my health.  When I don't I either ask questions or I google information.  This lets me get more information for the next time I visit the doctor.
0.916700	I feel fairly confident in my abilities regarding health and medical information.  I ask any and all questions I need to in order to understand the information being given to me and I'm not afraid to question a doctor or nurse regarding their information.  I am eager to learn and the health and medical fields have always interested me.
0.827800	I believe that I have the mental and physical capacity to obtain, process, and understand the information and services for health decisions. However, emotionally, I often feel that I don't have the capacity, as I am often stressed when visiting a doctor's office and either forget questions or feel ashamed to ask them. Financially I also avoid going to the doctor's, so when I do go it is usually for something unrelated to the questions I have been having in my day-to-day life. 
0.866700	I believe that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  I try to stay fairly well-informed, especially when the information pertains to my own health or the health of someone in my family.  My sister and mother are both RN's, so I have people to ask in case I'm confused and my primary provider isn't available.  I try to take the time to think of all symptoms, instances and relevant information.
0.794400	I feel like for the most part I can read and figure something out. Now when it comes to not knowing something I have a awesome doctor who is willing to put it in terms that I understand and who will explain it to me. Sometimes I might not understand something but I am the type of person who will research until I am able to figure it out. I feel I am probably able to process everything about 80% of the time.
0.616700	i feel like i usually understand the main points but not always the details or the reasoning behind what they are telling may. I dont understand enough to really form my own opinions on things, so i just do what the doctor says and hope it is what is best.
0.872200	I feel I can get and obtain basic health information with no problem. My go to would being doing research online if I really didn't understand anything and there was not a doctor or nurse to ask questions of.
0.427800	I feel at though I have the basic capacity, I need help.  The issues are so complicated and important, I always fear that I am not getting the whole picture, and really appreciate having someone around who can help explain and ask questions.
0.811100	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information I've read and heard. As for making appropriate health decisions, I feel mostly confident. If I have any questions, I feel confident in asking health practitioners questions. And I also have my mom, who is a nurse, to ask for advice.
0.916700	I don't have any problems understanding health information that is provided to me either in written form or verbally, and I can fill out my own medical forms. Also, I always ask as many questions as I need to of my health care providers.
0.583300	I feel fairly unconfident in understanding medial lingo. A lot of the terminology is really hard to take in. Especially if I'm already worried about the procedure or the test results. 
0.594400	I feel I have an understanding of how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. The issue I face is extracting that information from the healthcare professionals. I am very often left to google information on my own.
0.650000	I think I would have a basic understanding on what procedure or task I would need to do obtain the information required. Processing and understanding the information might take some time and that requires me to do some external research to get a more general idea. A second opinion is also helpful.
0.750000	I think that I have the knowledge to understand and make the correct health decisions. I am confident in the choices that I will choose to choose.
0.916700	First of all, I don't get sick that much.  I usually only have bronchitis and seasonal allergy so my condition is pretty simple. If at any given time I don't understand I will try to ask question or research it afterwards. For myself personally, I don't have any issue.  On the other hand I have to care of my love one and sometimes I could come into terms that I do not understand then I will request the health care provider to give me a simpler explanation.
0.844400	I feel like I have the ability to understand the information provided to me by medical professionals. Sometimes, I don't give doctors all of the information or ask the questions that I want to ask. I've dealt with anxiety but am unsure of whether or not I want to get it treated. Other than that, I try to be forthcoming. I also try to be easy to deal with so as to not seem like a bother.

0.855600	In general, I have no trouble reading and understanding health-related information. I am sure the fact that I am a psychologist (PhD) does not hurt. It is also helpful that my wife is a doctoral-level nurse with 46 years of experience. When I need to select a specialist, I rely entirely on here, as she can learn in 5 minutes what would take me much longer. Who would know best about which doctor to select than a nurse with access to other nurses who know.

I feel like I get a holistic and encompassing medical review and am well-informed. 
0.722200	I think depending on how the doctor explains it I can usually understand it.

0.738900	Sometime I do and sometime I not do to how they words thing after we talk about it. With the changing of words it can sound differ from before
0.616700	I broke my humeru last year and the doctor recommended surgery, but I declined because I don't have insurance.

0.844400	Given the information and questions asked I feel that I am very capable of understanding basic health information within reason. I may need clarification on various medical jargon used but I will pretty much understand what is being detailed.
0.805600	I feel that I can make the right health decisions because I listen closely to the doctor. If I can't understand what he said I ask him to repeat it. If I don't know what to do about something then I ask questions. I fill out all of my medical forms myself and if there is anything that I can't understand I get a nurse to help me.  
0.505600	I do not have a the capacity always to get all the help and information I need.  I bring someone with me to all doctor visits or hospital visits so they can help me to fully understand.  I get nervous on the spot so having a trusted person with me helps a lot.  I want to ask questions and get all the information but when I am alone I usually do not.  It is important to bring someone along.
0.916700	I believe I fully have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make health decisions. I am always open to more guidance and learning, but I do not require more assistance than average.
0.738900	In some regards I feel like I can ask my doctors questions.  However, to access second opinions and where to go for my children and what the waiting lists are like are very difficult to understand.  Especially for mental health care and education for children with disabilities and mental giftedness.  I've had a very hard time to get any information out of anyone as to where you can get adequate mental healthcare for an extremely gifted child without compromising their education and future career options.  This is extremely frustrating.  As well, wait times in ER's for children's mental health access is very discouraging as we've waiting 24 hours to get transferred to a mental health facility with a gravely ill child having mental health problems.  Why is there the disconnect? Why isn't mental health acknowledged and it passed off as a non-medical issue and labelled a behavioral issue as well.  Who can explain that to me?
0.827800	I think overall I have a good capacity to get and understand the information I need. I'm not scared to ask questions but I do sometimes worry I might forget to ask something important. I also sometimes wonder if my doctor gives me enough information. 
0.777800	I believe I have the capability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I am educated in a healthcare field and I also have had many health issues which have given me experience in understanding information given to me by my doctors and when I was in the hospital.

I also have worked in medical offices and centers for 12 years which has also given me a lot of exposure.
0.583300	i have a pretty good knowledge base and i am fully able to undersand the basics of health information and services .  So i all in all i feel i am pretty good at this. 
0.916700	I have no problems understanding health information.  I read and process information at what I would consider to be a normal rate of competence.  I haven't had any problems so far that I know of. 
0.866700	I can comprehend almost all written instructions unless their are way too technical. I can hear very well and can drive to various medical facilities to have tests performed when necessary. I have ongoing back issues and have had numerous test performed and everything has always been explained very clearly. I deal with the VA for health care so one can imagine the red tape and mumbo jumbo that is associated with them.
0.533300	I feel that I can understand and process some of the basic health information that is needed to make the appropriate health decision but sometimes health information can be overwhelming even basic. I feel if I could process it and understand it better then I would put a greater trust in the medical profession.
0.844400	"I feel capable enough to understand everything that is given to me, and sometimes go beyond the materials that are given to me by my physician, as I feel that sometimes these materials are ""dumbed down"" for the general public, and I prefer to get more scientific, in-depth information about health and illnesses."
0.750000	I feel I have more than average knowledge on healthcare and related services. I look up all procedures and medication before they are done or taken. If I need clarification on something I will ask a professional or search online. I will often try to find someone who has gone through similar health experiences to get their insight. It is also to my benefit I have a relative that is in a medical field that is informed on a lot of topics.

0.850000	I feel like I have complete capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Most of the time, when I ask for help with understanding a condition, it is only because the condition is new to me and I would like further explanation.

Only when I run across the rare statement in paperwork that I do not understand completely do I ask for clarification and it is usually received promptly.
0.900000	Overall I believe I can get the proper answers.  While I haven't gone to the doctor often for myself, I have to go regularly for my children for many different conditions including multiple medicines with different doses and times.

0.783300	In most cases I feel that I am able to find the basic information that I need regarding my general health, either from my nurse or physician or by consulting online literature.

0.783300	I feel I have the capacity to understand most things I receive, my issue is that medical professionals either don't listen when I ask a question or if they hear it, they half answer it or rush through the explanation. A lot of the time, I find myself going to Web MD after a visit to try and get more detailed information. Medical professionals are often too busy to take the time and answer you thoroughly and I can tell they are trying to hurry me through the appointment. Some written material I don't read, as it's repetitive and the font is like 1/2 point.

I don't understand a lot of medical terms, like names for tests. I also do not know pretty much anything about medicine. I have to pretty much completely trust my doctor's knowledge. I leave the doctor's office not knowing enough. I don't think to ask the right questions when i'm with the doctor. That or the appointment is so rushed that I don't have the chance to ask. I have to Google stuff a lot when it comes to medical stuff. 
0.638900	I feel that I have capacity to understand health information, but it is often difficult to obtain it because doctors are always busy and difficult to get information from.

Everything would be based on what my doctor or health care provider tells me. That is all I feel that is needed to make the appropriate health decisions in my life.

0.866700	I believe I have enough knowledge to understand health information, but I of course I need help from medical people sometimes to understand what the best option is and seek their advise. Dealing with a regular health care provider is pretty easy. But when my husband has been very ill and in the hospital I found getting information was excessively hard. If you did not aggressively ask you would not get an answer. And sometimes I had to persistantly ask for help about various solutions to his problems. There was no one person to talk to about someone in the hospital. It
0.833300	I have had a diagnosis of Anxiety and Depression for over 20 years so I pretty much understand all that is related to that. I have only in the past 3 years finally been diagnosed correctly with Bipolar Disorder and started treatment.

That is if i was for some reason afraid or unable to ask during a visit.
0.761100	I usually don't have trouble with the paperwork but when it comes to talking to medical professionals I feel that they are always in such a rush and ask the same brief questions repeatedly so there's little time for me to ask my own questions.

0.900000	Yes I feel that I am able to hear what my doctor says and understand their recommendations. There are times when I forget to ask them specific questions or give them details I had planned to mention. I usually ask them to clarify instructions just in case I misunderstood. Sometimes they do not give details and I have to ask them for instructions.
0.744400	I think sometimes I struggle to communicate verbally---like in person, I don't do a good job of explaining things. I also tend to panic and forget everything I was going to say, which means that sometimes I have follow up questions and stuff, that just don't get answered if I didn't write them down before hand. 
0.866700	I have absolute ability to understand, and if I don't, I will ask questions until I do. I read a lot and have common sense, and any information that falls outside of that I will look on the internet to get the right answer.

0.666700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and to process it.  If I don't understand, I have no problem asking questions until I do understand.  
0.811100	I think I have the capacity to understand my doctors information and to read about it online. But I think in the moment at a doctor's appointment I forget to tell them everything and so I worry they do not get the whole story. I also think that appointments themselves are expensive and I don't have the means to go to a doctor or get the tests I want done. I also think that health insurance policies are written in a confusing way where it limits what I do because I am not entirely sure what I can do. This narrows my health decisions a great amount.
0.605600	Sometimes I think doctors don't explain everything outright like they should in laments terms. They don't always give adequate resources and it feels like you're taking up too much of their valuable time if you ask too many questions. 
0.594400	I truly enjoy working at Health Decisions. The atmosphere is very casual, friendly, and has a good work life balance. I love how management has an open-door policy and are great in communicating and providing support. 
0.716700	I generally find that I am able to understand the basic concepts regarding health decisions. Sometimes I do need to clarify and get more information on things like, for example, diabetes and what needs to be done to control that given my risk factors. The one thing that completely flies over my head though is insurance. I can never tell if something is covered or not and it's a pain to have to try and figure that out so you don't end up paying a fortune if there is a generic that's cheaper somewhere. In my experience the Doctors and staff I've seen have always been kind, patient, and attuned to my concerns and willing to take a few minutes to explain what they suggest and why. That's really an important part because they don't need to go into all the technical details...just give me an idea of my options and a basic understanding of what they're trying to solve.
0.794400	I think that I'm perfectly capable of understanding any basic health information. If I had any questions I'd probably just look them up online so that I could get answers from multiple sources so I don't really ask that many questions.

0.800000	I think I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. For some complex information, I may need advice from an experienced professional, but I am a curious person and I like learning about things. I think that I have slightly above-average intelligence, with an average amount of experience, but no expert knowledge of the medical field.
0.772200	I BELIEVE I HAVE A GOOD CAPACITY TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISION. HOWEVER, SOMETIME I NEED A CLEAR EXPLANATION FROM THE DOCTOR.
0.866700	My sister is a doctor of medicine, so in the rare occurrence where I have any lingering questions or doubts that my doctor wasn't able to answer adequately,  I ask for her input. For the most part I am able to understand basic health info, due to asking my doctor questions, reading the health info pamphlets or researching it online. 
0.850000	I think that I am pretty capable. It helps that I have a very good primary care physician who explains things very well. My network also allows me to email my doctor, in case I think of questions later or have anything that I do not understand. But, most of the time, I fully understand what my doctor is telling me and what I need to do before I leave his office.
0.777800	I feel like I am pretty capable however there are somethings that can be confusing which I need help with. I can usually find this help from family or on the internet

0.855600	I feel that I can fill out paper work with no problem. If I am at the doctors and they are explaining things to me it's somewhat easy to process the information that is given to me. Sometimes I ask follow up questions to make sure that I am hearing the correct information. I feel sometimes doctors give you information in a way that is hard to understand so I feel like I have no other choice then to make sure that I am hearing everything correctly to make the right decision for myself. Once I hear the information at least twice I can be confident that I know what i need to know.
0.866700	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand basic health information services needed to make health decisions.  In fact, most of the time I look up the conditions online and read books about them so I have a better grasp of what I'm dealing with.  It's important for me to understand these things completely since I have really high anxiety and I am completely uncomfortable if I don't understand what's going on with me completely.
0.900000	I feel that I am quite capable since I consider the scientific research method to be the basis for my reasoning. When I receive information from a medical professional, if I do not possess a complete understanding of the information, then I research the information that I require to understand it. I, then, discuss any concerns I may have with the medical professional.  I find that this methodology works for me.
0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to read and understand the paperwork regarding my medical conditions.  I am also confident in my ability to understand basic health information and I am not afraid to ask questions regarding my care.  
0.683300	I usually have little problem. But only because I bring a list of questions with me to each dr appt. Having someone with you at the appt also helps. My wife and I remember different things the dr says. I look up the info on google when I  get home. 
0.633300	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basci health information and services. I usually refer to google but in the event that I need to get help for a medical personnel I would. 
0.755600	I mostly can. It is just knowing what questions to ask. When reading materials, it is hardly ever written in a way that someone who is not a medical professional can truly understand. 
0.916700	I do not have a medical background other than basic first aid and cpr training but I have always been fascinated with health issues in general. I try to keep current on health topics. I have a fair amount of experience helping relatives with their medical information and decisions. I have learned a lot through helping others about what questions to ask and how to make the most of doctor visits. I feel very confident in my abilities to do the same for myself.
0.666700	I feel that I can understand most of my health information.  I have a phobia of needles, so getting shots or having blood drawn is such a trauma for me, that my health has suffered.  I haven't been able to get a full picture of my gall bladder disease.  It's also been difficult learning what I can do to help myself without surgery because doctors don't want to let you try any other option.  They always want to remove your gall bladder. 
0.827800	I believe that I am capable of understanding health information that is given to me. I also feel comfortable looking for information online to help me understand better.
0.416700	Overall i find that obtaining, reading and processing the content of medical material is very difficult and challenging. Sadly it is difficult to find someone to help me understand what's being said.
0.722200	I feel fairly confident in my ability to obtain and understand basic health and services information. For advanced cases or something I didn't know about I would be less confident. But for average issues I think I have a good ability in understanding medical information.

0.838900	I have learned with age to ask questions. If i do not understand something I'm not afraid to speak up. I have also learned it is good to get a second opinion.  I have had instances where my PCP misdiagnosed certain conditions. 
0.683300	"I don't feel that I have enough understanding on my own. When I visit the doctor or a hospital, I usually am worried that I haven't explained everything sufficiently. So I'll will ask the doctor or the nurse a ton of questions. I don't want to be driving away and then think ""Why didn't I remember to ask about that?""."
0.783300	I feel that I can understand basic health information just as well or better as most people. I think that I have a bit more understanding of health principles because I read a lot about health conditions. Therefore, I think I can make appropriate health decisions based on my base knowledge about health.
0.844400	I have, many times in the past, successfully read and understood numerous medical documents. This includes those that come from the emergency room, family doctor, specialists, nurses, and pharmacies. Sometimes I will even read about a condition on the internet to learn more. At one time I had to read things to my grandfather, but he has passed now.
0.866700	I feel I have the ability to understand basic health information. I read a lot about health related issues. I have basic understanding of health related concerns I have. Also, I am good at asking questions. Based on this, I think I will be able to make informed decisions about my health.

0.788900	I think that I can do a pretty good job , I know that it's important to leave nothing on the table and ask any questions that I think are important. Also if I was ever going through a serious medical crisis then I would research online to make sure I'm getting the questions that I need to ask a doctor.
0.833300	I understand the majority of what doctors or nurses tell me. The only times I do not understand is when it is a subject that I know nothing about. I usually ask questions and when i do not fully understand I will try to learn about things from Google.
0.783300	I believe that overall I have a pretty good ability at obtaining and understanding basic health information and services. I have a doctor that I fully trust, and who I am always comfortable asking questions to. I also now have a pharmacy that I use, whose workers are also always willing to answer any slight questions that I may have. I have access to these physical people, as well as the Internet in order to gain information about anything else that I don't understand. I'll use it sometimes to check basic drug interactions that I can't remember, such as Tylenol and Aleve, or other such over the counter medications. I also have my parents that are always willing any questions I have concerning medical history when I have to fill out forms. I'm generally a nervous person, but when it comes to my health I do the best I can in order to receive all of the information I need, and not allow myself to feel bullied into making choices that may not be right for me.
0.838900	I believe that I currently have the basic information I need regarding my overall health, but I am also confident that if I were to have a question or concern, there are databases and reference centers that would help me to understand.
0.750000	I believe that if I don't get the answers I need from a doctor or nurse, I can always get further information online and I can use Google or WebMD or mayoclinic.com.  I an always call back the next day and ask if there is something I don't understand. I also have medical encyclopedias in case I want to look something up that I am unsure about.
0.866700	I believe I can understand the conversations I have had with a personal physician so far.  I am 70 years old but am basically healthy other than aches and pains, and see a doctor once a year for a physical. 
0.755600	I feel pretty confident obtaining and understanding information as it pertains to making decisions about my health. For issues that I don't understand, I have no problem seeking and finding help. 
0.916700	My main hobby is reading, and I prefer thought-provoking non-fiction articles. I read all I can on exercise, nutrition and prevention, plus have kept myself as mentally sharp as possible. If I am sick or have any kind of health problem, in addition to seeking help for it, I read everything I can about it to self-educate.
0.772200	I believe that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services if they are communicated to me by a health professional. Once they explain the service, and I have asked all my questions, I believe I have the information to make an informed decision.
0.916700	I understand everything I am told perfectly, and will take notes if need be. If anything, I ask more questions because I want to know exactly what I'm doing.
0.783300	I believe that I have sufficient skills an knowledge to accurately read and understand basic health information. I also know when I do not understand what I am being told and when to ask the questions I need to in order to fully convey what the practitioner is saying. Being able to do both of these things allows me to make appropriate health decisions.
0.661100	Oftentimes it can be quite overwhelming to take in the whole medical field information. Many terms are used that are very unfamiliar which in turn makes it all the more difficult to understand. While I may feel like asking questions I sometimes do not because I am most afraid that it will become even more overwhelming.  Most of the time I find myself googling things said by my medical professional in order to get a more clear understanding.  I also save the pages so I can refer back if I forget the terms or information. 
0.811100	I feel like I can understand and make basic decisions regarding my health but may need assistance with more complicated matters or forms.
0.605600	I understand my health questions quite a bit if not I tend to ask the doctor or dentist office as they told me not to check on internet as they said that information is not correct and to come to them only.
0.711100	I feel that the jargon used on official medical documents needs to be dialed down to my level of understanding. There is often too much redundant information.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my abilities to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I believe this is because I am a medical student, so I have a better idea of what to ask. 
0.916700	I am totally capable of talking to doctors or nurses about my health conditions.  I research anything they tell me and on later visits I will have a list of things to ask and I even take notes if I need to.  I may ask them about more natural alternatives of care especially concerning medication.  Doctors and nurses are human and only the patient knows what is completely  best for them.  
0.838900	I think I can understand health informagion to a great extent, based on my previous answers and my experience in hospitals before I only miss the medical expressions otherwise everything is understandable 
0.888900	I am well educated with a good vocabulary, so I feel that I am well equipped to understand health information and make decisions. Further, I am a scientist, so I have an understanding of medical terms. When I do not understand health information I have the resources to figure out what it means without asking another person.
0.844400	I feel I am very competent in understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The main time I have difficulty would be with major health issues.
0.844400	I feel that I have an above-average understanding of much health-related documentation.  I have grown up with parents who worked in the healthcare field so this helped me develop a basic understanding of many terms at an early age. Overall I would say I am above-average intelligence so this helps me grasps things with relative ease.  I have all of my abilities such as sight and cognition to understand documentation as well.
0.827800	I feel I have the capacity to learn and understand the basics when I visit any health professional. However, sometimes I leave the doctor feeling as if I didn't get as much information as I think I should have.
0.855600	I have no problem obtaining or understanding basic health information and services needed to make decisions regarding my health. I often do my own research to fill in what I didn't receive from the doctor
0.900000	I have a high  comprehension level when it comes to communicating with my health care provider or pharmacist.  They explain most things in basic terms and only used the big medical terms when there is no substitute.  I am extremely comfortable ask questions when i do not understand
0.855600	I have experienced a health catastrophe in which I suffered through the treatment recommended by Western medicine (actually, I avoided the most recommended treatment and am not a cripple today, or dead, as a result).  I'm a lawyer.  I read and understand complicated documents for a living.  That's not to say I like it.
0.916700	I do not feel that is a problem for me at all. If I don't feel like I understand completely what they are saying, I make it a point to ask for clarification. I also always make sure that they are understanding what I am trying to tell them as well.
0.861100	I feel I have the full capacity to do so. Understanding the scope of health problems is not an issue for me. i have one life and understanding my body and my health issues is important, and thus fully grapsing and listening to and comprehending doctors is something important and neccessary for me. 
0.800000	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I find it really helpful, however, to have someone else read or hear at the same time to make sure that I think of or consider everything.
0.883300	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services that are needed so that appropriate health decisions can be made.  I know how to ask questions if I do not understand and I know how to call or email my doctor also.  I also know that I can ask a loved one to get their interpretation of material that I might not understand.  Also, I can ask my doctor if I can record information so that I can listen to it again in case I miss something. 
0.855600	I feel I have the complete capacity to to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am in no way physically or intellectually compromised in such a way as to hamper my decision making abilities. 
0.916700	I believe I am 100% capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I can read and understand written material more than competently and understand verbiage just as well. I anticipate no problems in my near future also. 
0.822200	I feel that I get the information that I need from either the doctors I see or their assistants.  If I have questions about prescriptions I talk to my pharmacist, I usually get more complete information from her than the doctor on medications.  The internet has also been helpful in making decisions about my health care, in knowing which questions to ask of the doctor or hospital personnel.  I try to be very informed when it comes to surgeries or medications that are prescribed to me.  I learn best by reading, our local health care professionals are good about asking the best way that a person learns things so that they can accommodate everyone.  we are very fortunate in our health care for the rural area that we live in.    
0.666700	I believe I can fairly easily obtain basic health information.  Processing and understanding the information is usually a little harder but with the help of the internet, friends, and family I can usually figure out what I need to.  
0.783300	I feel somewhat confident. At times, because I am afraid of the answers, I don't ask the questions I need to ask, and I terrify myself further by reading google. But, most times, I know what I need to know.
0.900000	I feel like I try to enter the situation with my medical provider with some pre researched information so that I have an idea of what to ask. I try to maintain a healthy level of dialogue without giving too much unneeded information so that I can naturally ask for more information should there be an instance where there's something they tell me that I don't understand. I rarely hesitate to ask for more information if needed and if I do, I try to get back with them via email or other forms of communication.
0.811100	I think I have a good understanding and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needs to make appropriate health decisions. When I have questions about certain topics pertaining to making my appropriate health decisions, I ask questions to ensure I understand the situations between my situation and the health assistance that I am receiving. 
0.383300	I feel that is very important for me to understand what is happening to my health and what is happening to my body. Sometimes nurses are not qualified enough to help me understand my condition. Also filling out formalities can me very difficult at times as they are very complex and often list out diseases that I don't know about. 
0.755600	I have no problem reading basic health information.  I do sometimes have trouble filling out forms and generally have my wife help me with those since she's better with dates, doctor's addresses, etc.  I feel I sometimes don't get all the info I need since I'm somewhat shy and don't ask the doctors all the questions I probably should.
0.544400	I don't appreciate it when documents that I need to read are in medical jargon.  I need help understanding what is actually happening to me, and that frustrates me.  
0.677800	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually check on the web for information on health issues, and when I have questions, I will ask my Primary Care Physician. He is very good at explaining things so I understand them. My brother is also a Physician. I will occasionally ask him a medical question.
0.900000	I feel that I can understand pretty much everything that is explained to me  or that I try to find out. If I don't happen to understand everything, I am always sure to do my best to find out everything that I need to know before leaving or getting into a situation where I can no longer get help or assistance. 
0.838900	As far as basic information goes I'm fully confident I have the ability to understand what my doctors tell me. However if there's any serious issues I'll typically do my own research at home on the internet about the condition. Sometimes I'll have questions after I leave the doctor that I didn't think about while I was at the doctor, and I'll look up information online. This helps me fully understand it to a greater extent.
0.888900	I have a firm grasp of the English language and I'm reasonably intelligent and well read.  If I have questions about health information, I'm capable of finding a source that will answer my questions.
0.716700	I am able to read and understand material given to me regarding health. If I do have a question I have no problem asking for help to understand. 
0.783300	It is someone difficult to ask questions to medical providers. I often feel rushed when I'm at doctor's appointments and it's hard to think about what I need to ask. I like getting written information at the end of the visit because it is easier to understand and remember the information. 
0.722200	I have  the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions on my own. Most of the time I do not need assistance from others.
0.883300	I feel that I am quite capable of managing and comprehending basic health information for my children and myself. I consider my knowledge of health matters to be above average and I know how to research reputable sources when additional information is required. I also have a great rapport with my pediatrician's office and know how to call for information if needed.
0.766700	I think that I have an ok capacity.  I can read just fine but sometimes the medical wording confuses me.  I'll usually do some research once I've gone to see the doctor and been given some medical advice and that usually causes me to get further confused because there is so much information.  I'm also not confident asking questions so, I think that hinders my understanding a lot.  Also, like many others, I fail to tell my doctor everything and I know that it doesn't help my situation and can really hurt my health decisions because by keeping things from my doctor, I'm only hindering my diagnosis.  
0.672200	I am able to understand the medical information that is pertinent to me because I inquire what I do not fully understand from my doctors and nurses. Everything is simple enough to read and comprehend, but sometimes the medical jargon can be confusing to incorporate, so I would simply call them or setup a meeting to ask them face to face questions.
0.688900	If I dedicate the necessary time, I can usually figure everything out that was presented to me either in paper or verbal form. My biggest hangup is when it comes to billing from hospitals or doctors since it seems like the breakdown of charges is so detailed that it is easy to lose track of what expense was for what aspect of treatment. I do find myself not always able to ask the questions I would like to though when visiting a doctor because of how rushed it always seems. The doctors (any doctor) arrives after I have waited in the waiting room as well as in the examination room, and I know the doctor has other patients who are also waiting.
0.900000	I feel extremely confident in filling out medical forms or any forms for that matter.  If I don't understand something, I ask questions to both nurses and doctors.  I understand the importance of taking care of my body so I do the most I can do for myself and try to educate others also.  My husband drinks a lot of diet soda which I don't think is healthy since he is a diabetic.  I am currently not taking any medications and my blood work has been great.  I hope this information helps you in your research.
0.844400	I feel I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health info. I do sometimes do extra research after the visit to clarify and I am at times murky on details but on the whole I have a clear picture of my health and services needed.
0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I have never had a problem understanding information given to me by a doctor in the past. If I an unsure about anything I will ask questions until I fully understand. 
0.872200	I feel that I am quite literate enough to understand and process basic health info.  I am healthy and physically fit.  I have a science background so I do understand scientific jargon.
0.850000	I feel that when the doctor/nurse/health practice employee explains things in simple terms I clearly can undertstand my information.   Specifically, if they relate the information to my temperature, weight, blood pressure, air flow, and examine my blood for sugars, iron and cholesterol.   I start to have problems when things get explained through the technical terms since I have not been trained in the medical field.
0.888900	I believe I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When I don't understand something completely, I am sure to ask, if not right away then later through email or a telephone call. Sometimes health professionals use abbreviations or jargon that makes sense to them, but not to the average healthcare consumer. So when I don't recognize a term or need explanation, I ask.
0.916700	I believe I am competent enough to process and understand health information and services needed. I have the capacity to make smart decisions regarding my healthcare. I know what is right and wrong when it comes to my health needs. 
0.838900	I am old enough and been through enough to feel comfortable with health information provided to me to make health decisions.  If there are questions that I am not comfortable asking at the time or just dont ask, the information is often readily available on the internet to find.  There is no reason I should not have all the necessary information when I make a health decision.
0.916700	I feel I definitely have the capacity to understand and process basic health information and services. If I ever have questions, I have no problems speaking up and asking my doctor to explain something or answer a question I have.
0.833300	I think I have a fairly good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services I need to make the right health decisions.  My biggest concern is I am not always able to find the right information.
0.461100	I don't thin I am that good at it.I have major epilepsy and because of that I do not take new information on very well.It is very hard for me to understand new things that are told to me sometimes. Especially if they are in words I do not understand.I even have to wright down all of the medication I take & all of the questions I have a few days ahead of time to make sure I have everything I need to tell my Dr when I go in. 
0.638900	getting the information is reasonably easy, once you are able to contact your provider, thats the biggest headache that takes the longest, Actually speaking to a doctor or nurse is difficult and it time consuming. My doctor is however very good at explaining everything, causes,syptoms, treatments.
0.883300	I believe I have above-average capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic information. My capacity to obtain services would improve if insurance did not impede the process.
0.822200	I usually do research before I visited the doctor so I know what I'm up against.  If the doctor brings up something new and I don't understand it, then I will ask.  I want to know what is going on with me.
0.888900	I feel that I am very capable of understanding basic health information. I do not need any help reading or filling out any paperwork
0.744400	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information and make decisions about my health.  I can usually understand any material that is presented to me and if necessary I can research on my own to gain further understanding of medical information. 
0.722200	I always try to keep asking questions until I fully understand what is going on with a medical condition. The internet is also a great help to find additional information.
0.794400	I have a good degree to obtain and process basic health information. If I need help people with be around to assist me.
0.788900	Well my mom had many health issues and I never had a problem figuring out anything.  If need be I would get on the internet and find answers to what I do not know.  That is the same thing that I do now with my children say for example with their vaccines.
0.883300	I am very competent in filling out medical forms. I may have to get someone to write for me if the forms are small because of a lost nerve at C7/T1. Most of the time I don't though. I am well aware of my medical conditions and explain in detail what is going on with me to the doctor/nurse. 
0.916700	I have a full understanding of the best way to take care of myself: be honest with health practitioners, ask the hard questions and answer ones given to me honestly, keep up with check-ups, maintain a healthy lifestyle. I do not need help taking care of myself when it comes to the medical aspect of my life because I'm mentally capable and emotionally capable of doing so on my own. 
0.916700	I am pretty confident in myself with health decisions. I understand things easily and have no problem understanding or asking the appropriate questions when needed.
0.783300	I'm fairly confident in my ability to understand basic health information because I passed 8th grade English with no problems whatsoever.
0.844400	Whenever I have any kind of health issue, I heavily research the symptoms online, as well as all treatment options and medications, before I even go into the initial appointment.  I feel that it is very important to be informed.
0.916700	I think I have enough basic medical knowledge to handle most basic health information I am given, and I know enough to know when I need to ask questions  to make sure I completely understand the ramifications of any new health information
0.855600	I feel confident in my ability to understand medical information because I take the time to research and ask questions.  If I ever don't understand something or would like to discuss further I don't delay and ask right away.  I also go in to any appointments with my thoughts already written down so nothing is missed.
0.855600	I think I have the capacity to fully understand basic information and services. Sometimes I ask for better clarification when something is a bit more complicated, but it's not that often. I've also been lucky to have doctors and nurses that explain things in detail.  
0.700000	Sometimes hospital and health lingo are really hard for me to understand and sometimes my health problems are difficult to understand. I try to ask my doctors to tell me about every detail of my health and I ask for recommendations to improve my health or to maintain my health. I don't know what it is but it's like a mental block when I try to understand my health situations and how problematic some of my problems can be about my health. I feel helpless sometimes when I ask the doctor to repeat whats been said to me for the third time but slower. Filling out my forms aren't hard but confusing at times.
0.727800	I believe I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. I understand the body's normal processes and I can understand when something is wrong. However, when medical terminology is used, I sometimes need it to be explained.
0.761100	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a moderate degree. I think this is due to internet access and doctors making efforts for their services to be more accessible for patients. I do have some difficulty in having a few options and making the best decision out of those and seek guidance from a health professional or online.
0.916700	I'm not dim, nor am I senile. I can understand very well what I need to, and I have a help line that I can call twenty four hours a day. Plus there is always  the internet at my disposal anytime I need to find information.
0.638900	I feel somewhat confident in my ability to obtain information, however, processing and understanding it can be difficult. Oftentimes, I like to have someone with me (e.g., my husband) at my appointments with me to make sure I am properly taking in everything I need to know. When I am on my own, I have left appointments several times realizing I don't fully remember everything or perhaps have forgotten to ask certain questions.
0.822200	I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information. I haven't had any recent issues or bad experiences with understanding medical information nor have I had any issues in the past. This includes issues for myself and both of my parents who have also had their share of issues. 
0.883300	I have the capacity to use the internet, with which I prepare myself ahead of any physician visit. And after each one. I have good physicians but they don't always give information, and I like to understand things.I also know I am my own advocate. I feel fairly empowered.
0.800000	With the Internet it is easy to do research and become familiar with basic health information; while it isn't always accurate, it helps me become more informed and able to ask questions.  I can understand the basics and I make a list of questions to review with the professionals.
0.733300	I usually ask my doctor about any questions in regards to anything I have going on with me. For example, I had to see a doctor a few years ago over my swimmers ear and I had to figure out how to stop the pain in my right ear. I asked my doctor every question pertaining to how fast I would be healed.
0.900000	I usually understand whatâs being conveyed but if I donât I definitely ask questions and if necessary do my own research as well
0.805600	I feel I have an above average to obtain and understand basic health information.  I'm not afraid to ask questions. I always ask questions if I need more information.  I also make sure I'm given informed consent, if applicable in the given situation.
0.916700	I believe that I can fully understand all health related information I get. I process it all very well. If I come up with a question later on I will call the office back and ask it over the phone. I understand a lot medically especially when it's explained well to me. I can process everything that I get. I have always made accurate and appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.750000	i have the proper knowledge to understand majority of the things i dicuss with my healtcare provider.  There are alot of terms i am familar with and others i am not but i am very comfortable to speak with medical providers. Im not as lost as most ppl that's not familiar with the terminology.
0.900000	I feel that I have a lot of capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make the appropriate health related decisions. 
0.572200	I think i can understand it somewhat however somwtimes whe the doctor is talking to me i really do not know what they are saying or taking about 
0.588900	I read the bottle labels to understand what is asked of me when i take the medications that i have.I have a bit of understanding from previous medications that i have taking in the pass because it seems like all medications are close the the same 
0.844400	Well I believe getting the best care comes down to my ability to efficiently use Google. I mean nowadays that's just a default resume skill, but it's actually relaly good to have. Knowing what search terms to plug in and which links to follow to find the best information is extremely helpful in any situation, including finding medical help/info.
0.766700	Overall I feel I have the capacity to be able to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services because my mind is still very sharp. I am of sound mind and body. I am able to make other important decisions in my life so I feel I am totally capable of making health decisions. 
0.644400	I do feel like I can understand it all to a point. I went to school for biology and chemistry so I understand the deeper aspects but sometimes I just don't feel like my doctor understands. He is so busy. I haven't been to a doctor in a while. I do feel like I can understand information though to an extent and anything I don't, my mother will help me out with. I can make solid health decisions and have been. 
0.744400	I feel that I have full capabilities to understand, process, and follow through with any information needed on health decisions. I always end up knowing more information than most nurses most of the time.
0.872200	I feel that I am well-enough informed to communicate what is needed. I always turn to reference materials if need be....especially on medications. I am rarely given new prescriptions but when they are filled there is ample information given at the time of purchase.
0.794400	I have filled out medical paperwork and also have had times when I didn't understand something.  In any circumstance that I do not understand, I ask my doctor questions and or someone more knowledgeable than myself.  I have only had to do this one time.  I definitely feel capable of understanding basic health information to make health decisions on my behalf.
0.872200	I'm usually able to fill out all forms without problems, but a term used might make the question a little ambiguous. When that happens, I'll ask someone at the desk what it is asking for to be sure I'm filling it out correctly. Usually when I see my doctor for a yearly checkup and lab tests, we can chat a little about results, whether I need to do anything, and if there is something I want to being up or ask about. My doctor is very busy, but she does seem to want to answer my questions and is a good listener. I know that most of what I might be concerned about isn't a problem, so I don't bring up everything because it would probably be a waste of time. If something happens where I am sick, I can just make another appointment. My doctor uses easy to understand language gives me options when the advice is appropriate. I feel like I am part of the process, but I trust her judgement when it comes to giving me good health advice.
0.794400	I think I do have the ability to ask and understand health information if I so do so. Sometimes I might opt out of asking question, purely because I would find it embarrassing to ask such a simple question.
0.688900	I can generally make my own health decisions. The issue comes when doctors and nurses do not have time to give me all the information I need. I can understand most things just fine but if I do not have all the information I want then I can't make a good decision.
0.833300	I work in the health care field and Iâve had 9 surgeries so I have a pretty good understanding of what medical terminology means and I know how to obtain my information and my records.
0.777800	I believe I am capable of understanding the information that my doctors talk to me about. I always make sure to ask questions and sometimes I'll even write down questions ahead of time before the appt to make sure I don't forget.  There does always seem to be some things that are more difficult to understand just because some doctors do not take their time to make sure that we really know what he's saying to us. 
0.777800	I feel I am capable of understanding the health information given to me by health professionals.  If I have questions I usually can ask a family member such as my brother or my wife.  Also, I see numerous doctors, I am sure they would assist me in understanding.
0.883300	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process & understand basic health info in order to make decisions about my heath care. In addition, I keep a list of questions or problems to bring up before each appointment. I sometimes do research on the Web, but always discuss the research with my doctors.
0.827800	Basic health information is pretty straight forward in my opinion. The doctors and nurses do their jobs perfectly well, and help me as a patient understand my options, and whatever else seems to be going on. There could be some ways that hospitals could improve upon their services such as having online forms in order to fill out information before hand which would make it much easier to get serviced quickly. Most of the time I can understand, and process the diagnoses that I have been given, and with the help of online resources the doctors job is not as necessary to explain in detail if I don't understand something or have questions I can quickly look it up and if I am still confused I can contact my doctor in order for he she to clear things up for me.
0.616700	I can read but it's hard for me to concentrate on what I am reading so I usually have to read a sentence three times. I'm not good at asking questions, I have a predisposition of not wanting to impose on people. 
0.750000	I feel like I can communicate with a doctor about any health problems I might have, but my issue comes in with trying to understand everything.  Also sometimes you get materials that you can take home with you to read, and I feel like those materials just make me more confused.  So while, I may not understand everything, hopefully the doctor knows enough to properly evaluate and treat me.
0.777800	I have the utmost ability to do what I must to understand every facet of any health related issues I have, before I go to a medical professional I tend to make notations of questions I might have on my smartphone memo app for reference during consultations/visits. I also ask for any external resources online that I can review/read to help me understand, also I am not concerned about asking the same question to different specialists/medical professionals in order to ensure I have obtained accurate information. As well as needing help with forms/directions/instructions there are usually a myriad of staff members who are always read to help.

0.716700	I think I have an average understanding about basic health information and services when making health decisions.

0.883300	I am very confident. When I think I need additional information, which is frequent, I look it up.

0.872200	I feel I am more than capable to do these things.  I am certainly intelligent enough to process and understand basic health information, and I make my own health decisions on a regular basis, as well as decisions regarding my children. I don't visit hospitals that often, however.

0.794400	I feel that I am able to get the information that I need about my health when I need it because my doctors are easy to talk to and understand me when I ask for  help.

0.794400	For the most part, I feel like I can obtain and understand the information. I do get overwhelmed by the decision making process.

0.900000	I usually have no problem understanding what I am told. If I need to, I can usually get the doctor to explain it to me in a way that I understand. The doctors I have had are usually really good at explaining things in a way that I understand, so I rarely have trouble with any information.
0.672200	I have the ability to obtain the information I need about health services and decisions.

0.844400	In general, I believe I have the capability of processing my health issues accurately. The only thing that needs to be worked on is my willingness to speak up if something is unclear, or if I just don't want to feel like I am talking too much. I may miss out on needed information that way.
0.627800	I have some issues understanding some things, hospitals and doctors give me bad anxiety so that makes the problem much worse. I can almost always get the information I need from a doctor or nurse and if I can't get it from them I use google or ask my mom. I feel I am very capable to get the information I need but I sometimes have a hard time understanding it, that is where I always make sure to have someone explain it to me.
0.861100	Being an adult of reasonable intelligence, I feel I'm able to comprehend much of the information I receive from health care providers and I'm fairly comfortable asking for clarification on concepts I'm unfamiliar with. I have a firm grasp of the English language and solid reading comprehension skills. This makes it relatively easy for me to understand written materials.
0.833300	I do feel i am capable of understanding basic medical information provided to me. Hospitals are very scary in my opinion but i believe doctors are really good at breaking down information and explaining things. Also refering you on topics to research to get further information.
0.811100	Before I visit my doctor, I usually call and tell them on the phone, why I need to make an appointment with them. When I get to the doctors office, they also give me a form to fill out.

0.794400	I am confident that I am very capable to process basic health information to make the best health decisions for me since I know all about my body ever since I have been frequently visiting my personal doctor whenever the time is needed.
0.500000	i do need assistance because i have ms and have all kinds of memory problems. i do not remember or remember correctly information so i do have a caregiver and partner help me to answer correctly. even when i didn't have cognitive challenges i might need a little help but now, as my health history is very complex, i do need help. 
0.761100	I am currently a senior at a University. So I feel very confident about my ability to obtain, process ,understand the necessary information regarding my health and make appropriate decision regarding my health.

I have been to the university hospital several times on my own. I have talked with a physician several times and followed physician instruction carefully. I have had no problems that I can think of. So I feel very confident regarding my health decision. 
0.705600	Generally doctors just need enough information to know whats wrong with you so that they can help you as best they can, but it is pretty easy to know what is wrong with yourself and maybe a doctor isnt necessary. I have pretty easy access and I've been through lots of doctors, but I usually just use them as a second opinion.
0.800000	Regarding the information that I obtain from medical staff I usually understand the process I will be foregoing and I understand health information. Being I have heart issues that are chronic I try to listen very carefully.
0.916700	I feel I am 100% able to obtain, process, and understand the basic information and services I need to make appropriate decision on my health. I recognize that help is available should I not fully understand, and I reach out for that help when it is available and when I need it.

0.833300	I feel totally able to make decisions for myself and feel that I have an above average understanding of medical issues since I was employed in healthcare for 25 years. In addition I have always been interested in the subject of healthcare. However, I do not like to go to doctors and rarely go unless it's an emergency.
0.838900	I feel fairly confident in asking doctors, physicians, and nurses about anything that I'm unsure of when I'm receiving medical care. I think of medical staff as partners in my journey to retain good health, so i feel it's necessary to ask clarifying questions and to make sure I'm fully aware of everything that's happening with my health.

0.827800	"When I go to the doctor for something more complex than a cold, I always make sure to prepare questions ahead of time. I also usually bring a notebook so that I can write down the answers and do further ""research"" or ask follow up questions if needed"
0.900000	I grew up in a family where a large portion of the women in my family were nurses or had worked in the medical field. So this environment allows me to have a somewhat decent understanding of health information and understanding medical forms.
0.900000	I think to a high degree. Not only am I assertive about getting information from the health professionals that I deal with but I have the greatest library on earth, the internet, at my fingertips. In addition I am a very good reader, so I am rarely confused by written information.
0.605600	I have a bit of trouble understanding the terms of some health conditions and what certain things mean. Otherwise though I don't really find it to be too much of an issue and I typically can ask for help from someone whom works in the office and understands the process better.
0.916700	I do feel that I am capable of making any decision that needs to be made and processing any information given to me about my health care. I am actually a physical therapist and I feel that I am pretty intelligent so I think I am completely able to do anything that needs to be done regarding my health. If I have any questions, my wife is also a physical therapist and my parents are both doctors so I am confident I can get answers if I need them.
0.827800	I think that I am fairly able to do this all by myself. I think I am capable to ask the needed questions. I would need very little or no assistance to get the information that I need.

0.883300	I feel confident that if I'm comfortable (meaning they're helpful and nice) with the doctor/nurse that I will ask all of the questions necessary and make sure they explain it to me in terms I can understand. Usually with paperwork, if I'm confused by something, I will always ask for assistance from a receptionist, etc. 
0.900000	I have been through some major surgeries, and have some chronic health conditions that I have been dealing with for many years.  When these conditions first arose, having no previous knowledge of most of the information that was given to me, it was somewhat daunting to try to understand everything presented to me. I had excellent providers then, and all the information that I needed was provided by someone in the process.  Currently, I feel that I am experienced in these situations now to know enough about my situation.  I  also remain very confident in the information provided to me by professionals.
0.822200	I don't go to the doctor very often but when I do, I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and when I don't fully understand something, I can usually do some research on my own to better understand it.

0.838900	I do my best to make sure before I leave the DR office that everything is explained to me. I do not have a problem with asking questions. They always help me make sure I understand. Most of the time I do understand what they are saying. I had some experience with questions and trying to understand things when I took care of my parents.
0.722200	I make sure to ask the doctor as he is explaining it to me, there are times when I feel like I am asking dumb questions because of the face the doctor makes. So I will just give up and wait to ask the nurse just before I leave the appointment. 
0.900000	I have a biology background, so I can understand what is going on most of the time. In fact, I often feel like the doctor knows less about me than I do. I try to explain what is going on in detail so the doctor knows.
0.744400	I feel that I am confident that I can get basic health information.  I think if I can't get the answers by asking questions I can look in other areas to learn the information.  
0.738900	I feel that I have the ability to process the information that they are giving me. I like to get stuff in writing as well so I am able to refer back to what was said to me at a later time. Having the information in writing also helps me to do some research on the topics when I am at home after the appointment. I will also ask questions in person whenever possible so that they can explain things further 
0.744400	I feel that my capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information give me to me is good.  Sometimes, I helps to have another person read the information and explain some uncertain points.

I'm computer literate and I do look up terminology that I don't understand and my daughter-in-law is an RN and works in the ER and she's a good resource for me.  I use the patient portals corresponding to my doctors and these have helpful information as well.
0.916700	I have the ability to process and understand information about my health. I also have the ability to research what is instructed to me by health professionals.
0.816700	Generally speaking, health documents are intimidating to approach but are understandable through repeated readings; furthermore, assistance is generally available if needed. I feel any decision related to health concerns are met with enough understanding to be properly accessed.
0.694400	If I go online and do my own research I feel that I can get answers. I don't feel like doctors, nurses, or pharmacist are able to answer questions. I have had many cases where I've been told things I have discovered to be inaccurate or simply not true. Doctors/nurses/pharmacist often repeat to you what they have read or been told. I can read it for myself online first hand.
0.900000	I have a scientific background and rarely have trouble understanding information or instructions given by medical professionals.   Hopefully this helps in asking the right questions.
0.766700	 I think I can understand most of the required information. For the stuff I don't understand, even if a doctor or nurse fails to answer my question adequately I can look up information on the internet. So, overall, I think I have high capacity to comprehend such information.
0.794400	I feel that I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand different basic health information.

I am able to make decisions about my health, and ask questions clarifying anything that I need more elaboration on. It is not difficult for me to research health information either. 
0.661100	I think I can obtain the information I need. My issues are when they use medical terms that people outside of the field donât understand. Googling the term doesnât always work as some terms have contextual meaning. 
0.738900	I feel that as a college graduate with a biomedical degree I'd like to think I'm pretty capable of the above, obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I think my ignorance is in the wording of some things, especially on forms as was mentioned earlier. 
0.844400	I feel confident in obtaining and processing basic medical information for myself. I do not have trouble understanding my doctors. I do not always agree with my doctors,but I am able to understand what they are telling me. 
0.883300	I feel very confident in my ability to understand medical information.  I have never had a problem doing this task in the past and would not anticipate having it in the future either.  I have taken some basic health classes and have a good general idea of the medical field, including insurance, etc...
0.844400	I feel sometimes like I am not taken seriously by doctors. I suffer from chronic migraines and fatigue. Whenever I have brought this up with any doctor, the story is always the same: they write it off as just a lack of something in my lifestyle, maybe give me something which only barely helps, and send me on my way. I may not be the healthiest person, but I know when something's wrong with me. I wasn't always this way. I rarely ever had migraines before I went through puberty. Even then, I had more energy, but after I was in a car accident things got a lot worse for me.
0.916700	That stuff is pretty easy to understand and I make sure to ask my doctors or nurses everything I'm unsure about.  After I leave the office, like when I'm reading about any prescriptions, if there's anything I need help with, I just search for more information online.  I have no trouble understanding it.
0.861100	I have had a few medical issues since I was born, and am fairly accustomed to medical forms and medication instructions.  Also, my mother is a nurse and works interviewing patients, and I have learned a bit from her about how hospitals and the medical industry work.  I feel like this makes me capable of understanding most information presented to me by my doctor.
0.766700	I am not afraid to ask questions when I'm uncertain about a medical situation so while I may not understand right away, I will get answers. In addition to asking a medical professional, I go to as many resources as I can to find out about the condition. That said, I would say I'm slightly above average in terms of understanding basic health information.
0.916700	I feel I can obtain and understand all basic health information and services needed. I can make my own decisions about healthcare services, and sometimes it is not what the doctor recommends.
0.650000	I feel like things can be complicated on papers and forms, it can be hard for me to understand. I've come to realize that sometimes nurses will be able to give you better information than some doctors. 
0.916700	At age 35 and my comprehension I feel I have 100% capacity in how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services that are for me and that are needed to make appropriate healthcare decisions. I am well versed in my care, health issues, medical issues, basic medicines and my insurance policies. If there is something I am unsure of I have no problems or difficulties in asking for an explanation.
0.688900	I feel like I understand most of what they are saying but sometimes the terminology they use or their writing is not able to be understood by most people including myself.  They sometimes need clarification.
0.688900	I feel that if it is explained to me simply I can easily understand what is being said. I can also ask all the questions that I need to ask in order to get the answers that I need. 
0.850000	I feel that I have a pretty good ability and capacity for these things. I can understand most of it and if I don't I can find someone who can. Sometimes it is a bit hard to find someone but I make sure that I do. 
0.844400	I feel that i have the ability to understand basic health information. I am usualy very healthy except when i am pregnant That's when issues tart. When I receive information from a doctor or nurse that something may be wrong, I try to ask all the questions that come to my mind. If i forget, I write them down. My uncle was a nurse before he retired so he is always there for me to assist with making health decisions. I feel that i am capable of making the right decisions for myself and my family.
0.688900	I would say I can understand the majority of the information given to me by my doctor and do occasionally need further explanations and advice when making a decision. Often times some forms aren't written well or are not as understandable as others and give me a hard time when filling them out. The use of medical jargon also confuses me sometimes when filling out paper work and when my doctor explains my results or condition.
0.844400	I feel fairly confident. Sometimes though I don't feel like I have enough of the doctor's time to ask all the questions I want or to receive all the explanations I need. Some things I need repeated because they're complex but I don't always feel like there's time for notes and repetitions.
0.822200	"I feel I am fully enabled to understand basic health information, as I I am extremely literate and studied in medical conditions, including scientific terminology. This knowledge base is self-pursued rather than academic. I also do not worry about asking ""stupid"" questions to medical professionals."
0.816700	I have a good general knowledge of medical procedures, medications and facts.  However, there are occasionally topics that I'm sure I know something about that I'm wrong on.  Because of this, when I'm interacting with my doctors, nurses and pharmacists I will clarify by repeating what they said to me to make sure. If I'm unsure I'll ask for more information. If I'm not at the office or pharmacy and I'm unsure about info I've called the doctor's office (or pharmacy) and asked for clarification.  Just last week I called the nurse online to help me decide whether or not to take my son to urgent care.  It was very helpful. 
0.588900	I feel that my education which included anatomy, first aid, and a health course perhaps puts me on a slightly higher pedestal than an average person. I know a fair bit of terminology, symptoms, solutions, and of how the body works, but I am by no means an expert. The bureaucratic portion of the forms needed at doctor's offices were done by my guardian until I was 19. Because of this I feel that I have had very little time exposed to them, and as such need extra help usually on one or two sections, never the whole thing however. I feel it is harder to obtain than to process and understand as many doctors are very busy.
0.900000	I think that my skills in getting and processing this information is fairly good or at least as good as the average non-medical expert.
0.916700	I believe I have the full capacity to obtain, process and understand health information and services. I am able to search for information I don't understand or ask to assistance in having it explained to me.
0.827800	I try to think logically when talking with my doctor. I ask myself what information will be most useful when explaining my problem and what I'm expecting to get from the doctor. I make sure to ask questions I have even if some questions might be common sense.
0.916700	I believe that I am capable of understanding basic health information. I am a pretty smart individual. If I need help with something, I will just ask. If nobody is available, I will check the internet.
0.866700	If I don't understand something I ask questions about it until I feel that I understand what they're saying. Sometimes they can get rude about it but for the most part doctors and nurses take the time to make me understand. 
0.888900	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand my basic health information very adequately. I ask questions if I am not sure what a doctor/nurse is saying, and I read through the materials they give me. I feel competent to make my health decisions. 
0.722200	I recently had surgery and I felt like after every appointment (which were significant, including MRIs, physical therapists, anesthesiologists) I had to Google everything that was told to me. I would forget what I should ask when I was in the room, because I was too busy trying to process what the doctor or nurse was telling me. I know they're busy people but I wish I had more time to process and then ask questions.
0.827800	I am a fairly intelligent person, becuase of this if I do not understand something, I ask a question.  No shame.  Medicine is not my chosen profession.
0.761100	i feel that i have a high capacity to understand all basic health information and services. any time i'm sick i understand what the doctor and nurse tell me. anything i need help with i'll look up online or ask someone.
0.916700	I'm pretty smart in things so I feel pretty confident that I understand and can figure out what something is saying or what someone is saying to me.

0.794400	I feel ok in most instances when it comes to my health and any health related questions I may have.  Generally I ask the upfront questions of my medical care people but then I also rely on research i do myself to fill out that information when I have questions.  It's sometimes frustrating having to wait on test results and, generally, I feel,that's where the communication breaks down between patient & doctor.  Every time I ask 'When will X be ready?'  I get the answer that goes from tomorrow to next week with no definitive time line and that is incredibly frustrating to me.
0.900000	I feel like I understand the information given to me very well. I want to be a lawyer, so I have no problem understanding official documents. Additionally, I have lots of doctors in my friends and family, so I have plenty of people to ask when I have problems understanding information.

0.844400	I feel like for the most part I can obtain, process and understand information and services related to my health to make decisions. the only thing that would stand in my way is that sometimes there are details that you don't want to share with your doctor, that make you uncomfortable.

Given that I had over 15 years of experience with my parents and their doctors it gives me the confidence that I need now to take care of myself when needed and to ask the questions that I feel I need to have answered.  
0.755600	Yes, I guess so. Basic information is no problem. Basic information about my health issues is easy to understand. But health issues don't fit neatly into the basic information. I think I need more than the basic information to make decisions.

0.766700	I'm confident that I can find the answers to things that I might not understand. The Mayo Clinic website provides a wealth of information that helps me understand anything that I have questions about.
0.766700	I think I have the ability to process basic health information. I am not an expert by any means but since I have not had health insurance for 10 years, I've had to rely on my own research top determine my ailments. Apart from that, I've done my own research about medicines and read news about the latest things going on in the science world.
0.738900	I feel like I've usually understood what I've been given. I don't have much experience. Nowadays, my brother's girlfriend is a doctor, so if I had any major questions, I could ask her. 
0.872200	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand information to make health decisions.  If I don't understand something, I usually ask the doctor to further explain, and if I have more questions after I leave the doctor, I will do further research on my own.  I have done this in regards to my children's and my husband's health as well as my parents health concerns to further understand their problems.

0.461100	I feel like I do have the capacity to understand. I do feel however that health practitioners don't assess me on an individual level. I have a long history of being medically different,  certain tests and advice are not applicable to me. I have taken medicine that has opposite side effects on me not disclosed on the medicine brochure. Doctors usually don't believe the side effects I explain to have. 
0.700000	I believe that I do have the ability to obtain process and understand basic information, but sometimes the way it is conveyed is difficult to understand, and they use too many âdoctorâ terms that normal people do not understand.
0.511100	as far as I'm concerned I have enough ability to ascertain and digest the medical information provided to me unless I am not as sharp as I think, but then I normally ask my wife for help on hard to understand information.

I often come up with questions to ask my doctors before my appointments, so that I don't forget.

I also feel confident about researching and reading more information about concepts or diagnoses that are unfamiliar to me.

0.916700	I feel like I am fully capable of reading and understanding what is being told to me about my health, but sometimes cost prevents me from getting all the treatment I feel I need or desire. I think I don't always have the funds to obtain the treatment and information I need.
0.866700	I feel I am able to obtain and comprehend basic health information and services. My decisions are usually made with my husband so if there is some misunderstanding on my part he helps to clear it up. Otherwise my doctor and nurses are very willing to help.
0.722200	I have a pretty good understanding of the basic health forms given at the doctors. At times, when it comes to insurance mostly, I have trouble figuring out what they mean by what.
0.644400	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand the basics but the details are often confusing. I have a close friend who is a nurse and she helps quite a bit.
0.827800	I feel like I am competent enough to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed. Sometimes I may forget to ask pertinent questions while there. I may look the information up online or contact the doctor's office to obtain any additional information I need or am unsure about. 
0.655600	I would say for most basic health related information and services, I can grasp it if I take time to read through it and have a way to ask questions if needed.
0.888900	I have an undergrad degree in biology and several family members in the medical field (1 doctor, many nurses, 2 respiratory therapists), so I feel confident that I could either understand it on my own or ask them for help,
0.616700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, understand and process health information and services to a certain degree.  When they start using heavy medical jargon then I know it's time to get someone to assist me.   It's very important for me to understand what's going on as far as my diagnosis and treatment.  It's not difficult at all to get assistance but it is critical as far as making appropriate health decisions.

There have been times when I have been reviewing a medical report of mine where I didn't understand the language.

0.761100	I believe that for the most part I can understand any basic health information so long as it is explained to be correctly. Anything I fail to fully understand I can look up the information myself until I get it correct.

0.883300	I feel that I have the capacity to take care of most of my health related stuff on my own but I do wish that doctors would be more precise and explain a lot more about the medication they give me. I understand basic information though, just not when they use very technical words or medicine names. 
0.827800	I feel that I am fairly competent when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. I have had a chronic illness since I was a child and spent several of my teenage years very ill. It took several years for doctors to realize what was wrong with me so I spent a lot of time doing research of my own, asking questions, and learning about my health and my condition. My mother has also had lupus my entire life and as a child I was educated very well on that and how her condition was treated and I often went to the doctor and hospital with her.
0.738900	i feel that I have at least an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a major issue attempting to process said information, and any minor issue has been quickly resolved. 
0.577800	I think I have the capacity to understand most things that are related to my health. If I do not understand something, I also have the capacity to seek out extra information through sources available to me. I sometimes feel a little nervous about asking doctors questions because I almost feel like I should know what something means if they tell me.
0.833300	I don't have problems reading or understanding the information given to me by health practitioners. Sometimes I may read up on a condition etc on the internet for a better understanding if I still need more answers. 
0.811100	I feel like overall I'm well equipped and capable of obtaining and understanding any basic health information I may encounter. I am a fairly healthy person and rarely visit the doctor, so my exposure has been minimal up until now. However I think I would overall be able to navigate what was thrown at me unless it was some crazy rare condition
0.772200	I think that I am fully equipped to understand my basic health information and services. Especially since I have many medical professionals in my family I can ask. However, how it pertains to insurance is where it becomes very complicated, because things like what is covered and what they pay and so on.
0.900000	I'm quite able to ask questions that I might have about my medical needs and understand what is explained.  If there is any other questions that I have, I don't hesitate to ask.  Also when I get have time, I research online the information that I was given and if there is another option, I bring that up with my doctor.
0.794400	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information however my problem is I get extremely nervous at the doctors office.

0.844400	I feel well within my ability to process medical and health information as I haven't stumbled on any step of the process yet. Getting to this point was fairly seamless from childhood, when my parents would fill out most of the documentation and so on.
0.766700	"I work in the healthcare industry so I feel that I have adequate knowledge on it. I work with patients and with doctors so I am that ""translator"" for patients that may be confused on medical terminology"
0.872200	I don't have much of a problem understanding medical terms and health information. If it is basic knowledge then I usually understand what my doctor is talking about. I also know more terms from taking college science classes in university. With obtaining the information I have no problem going to my doctor whenever I need questions answered about my health. Like asking why I get a pain in my chest occasionally. My doctor had no problems asking me more questions to be able to find out the cause of my problem. Now when I get that pain I worry less about what underlying illness it could be and now I know how I can get rid of it.
0.844400	I am fairly young still so I don't have a ridiculous amount of pills or supplements that I need to take a day so that is one thing I do not have to worry about. However even at my young age I have spent a good amount of time in a few different hospitals. Two times because of an injury and once because of a personal health problem. I never really had any trouble understanding what exactly I needed to do in order to prevent any further injury. The doctors explained to me clearly what I needed to do and even if I didn't understand something I had no trouble asking them directly what to do.
0.833300	I have great capacity in obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I think that I am entirely capable in taking care of myself and communicating to my doctor the things that I need to do to maintain my health and safety. I am confident in my abilities.

0.816700	Although I do not have a background in health, I feel that have the capacity to fill out health forms, understand health conditions, and process basic health information.  Generally I know enough from the outset, but when I don't am comfortable asking my physician questions, and I think I have a good grasp of the sources that I can trust online.  It's rare that I can't find a good answer to a pertinent health question on the internet.
0.677800	I feel that I understand most of the information and forms that are required of me. I take the time to understand what information is needed and anything that they need to know about me, my conditions or any issues. I have a state of mind of getting a task done and filling out any health information.
0.838900	I feel greatly that I have the capacity to comprehend my health situation. I work in the medical field for a contract research organization and am a cancer survivor. I know what to ask and when, and I know how to translate when I receive. 
0.916700	I am literate and highly educated.  I am able to obtain and comprehend basic health information and services needed to make my own health decisions.  
0.866700	i think i have the capacity to obtain,process,and understand heath information because i will ask a doctor or a nurse, or i will check online for any information i might need to make appropriate health decisions  for myself or any family members.i have not had any problem understand health information in the past. 
0.777800	I feel that I am intelligent enough to understand enough about health information and services needed to make decisions related to my health. It is things like health insurance that I struggle understanding completely. Sometimes I don't think of proper questions to ask when I'm in the room with my doctor -- it's once I actually leave the room and think about it more that I have additional comments or concerns. 
0.900000	Though I am not a doctor or a nurse, I worked in an environment related to medical, and I learned some knowledge by myself, so I am very confident to make appropriate health decisions.
0.650000	I believe that I have the capacity to process the basic information that a doctor or a healthcare professional tells me. I do not think a doctor would just leave you blindly, they would help you understand what is going on. And even if they do not give me all of the information I will still have a decent understanding of what is happening to me. I am no where near educated as a doctor is but I have taken quite a few medical classes, such as medical terminology so I have at least a basic understanding of what I would need to know when a doctor is breaking the information down to me.
0.861100	I think I am able to obtain, process and understand any basic health information needed to make health decisions. I have enough background to understand this kind of information.

0.883300	While I have no specialist knowledge, I an very good at understanding health information.  I come from a family in the medical field so that has helped.  I am also very good with language and have the skills needed to process this information.
0.900000	I feel that I have a good grasp of medical terminology and lingo. My grandparents and father have all had vast dealings with the medical community, which makes me feel comfortable and familiar with what happens at a hospital or a doctor's office. Medical professionals don't seem as intimidating and medical procedures as scary as they once did. That regular contact with medical professionals definitely makes me feel more confident in my ability to manage my own care. 
0.655600	When i am with the doctor or nurse i ask as many questions as i can. I want to know as much as i can know before i leave their office, because when i get home  it is so hard to find accurate information regarding a medical condition. I can look online but the internet has to much or incorrect information. Asking a friend or family member to help is not always the best information and mostly can be biased i think. It almost like every form needs to have an instruction book to come with it.
0.672200	I feel like its possible to find the information that I need online. When I go to the doctor, I always feel like it's rushed and they just make a diagnosis and then want to leave as soon as possible, not really having any concern for any questions that you may have. I don't like this part about it. 
0.694400	Both of my parents work in the medical profession and help explain medical terminology if i have a query. I also have google to help explain stuff to me when i'm confused on a certain subject.
0.816700	I think it depends on the reasons why i'm in the hospital. If it is just a regular check up i usually don't have any problems understanding basic health information. Few month ago i had some issues with my stomach and because i'm not very educated in that sphere i needed more help of the nurse to understand what was wrong with me and why i needed to take the test that i was asked to do 
0.583300	I am not fully qualified to analyze in depth about the medical topic, but I am able to understand and analyze many basic things about medicine. I have learned all these things throughout my life while I care for other people or even, I learn it when I take care of myself. That's why I consider that I can understand the things that will be discussed in this survey
0.872200	Iâm your average adult so I think Iâm doing a pretty good job at understand things related to my health and communicating and understanding health professionals. 
0.633300	I think that sometimes I do not know what to ask doctors, nurses, or pharmacists. I do not know what I don't understand sometimes. I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information, but sometimes I think I lack the underlying mechanisms and understandings associated.
0.838900	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on doing all the mentioned above in regards to filling out medical information. I usually don't find myself getting stuck very often while filling out forms. There have been a few occasions where I did need assistance though. 
0.261100	I feel like there is too much information and too many words. The font is also really small with little space to write. I also hate it when I have to rewrite things that I have already written. Why can't it be easier? 
0.744400	Most times when I go to the Doctor I have to get the Doctor or a nurse to go over any and all paperwork, so I will completely understand all directions from the Doctor.  My health is very important to me and I do not want to leave the office confused about anything that the Doctor has said.
0.900000	I usually have no issue in understanding things told to me by medical personnel. I studied nursing before becoming a teacher so many terms are still identifiable to me. If I don't understand I have no problem asking questions until I fully understand.
0.794400	I feel confident in understanding basic health information. Sometimes I think of something I wanted to ask or clarify later, and wish I had thought of it in the moment while talking to a health professional. Occasionally, language used in documents is a bit wordy or complex, but I can usually understand sufficiently enough to make informed decisions.
0.766700	I feel that for the most part i can understand what i am being told.  I have problems when it becomes too technical or sometimes when discussing how much insurance will cover vs my responsibility.
0.794400	I believe that i have the ability to get all of the info i need about medical conditions from by doctors, and nurses, and also the interenet is something i can use, and take adnvatage of in order to make sure i have al the information that i need about any medical visit
0.822200	I have a lot of experience with doctors as I've had to deal with them when my mother was terminally ill. Sometimes things were hard to understand, but most of the time I was able to understand everything. We had to do all sorts of paperwork and make so many decisions. It was a mess.
0.872200	I am highly literate and not unknowledgable. I usually never have a problem asking questions relevant to my situation or understanding what is being explained to me.
0.916700	I know where to obtain basic health care information and services. This includes forms and documents. I know how to fill out the forms on my own and understand what information the forms are requesting without receiving any help. I'm able to understand forms and documents that provide basic health information and services in order to make informed health decisions that are appropriate for me.
0.916700	I am confident in my abilities to understand what has been given to me to read and know how to obtain additional information if needed. I also do not hesitate to monitor my own lab values and to ask any health-related questions to which I feel I require additional information.
0.772200	I believe I have the capacity to understand and complete medical paperwork. Sometimes it is hard to understand what the doctor is trying to tell you because at times it seems like they don't actually listen to all you. Lots of time I'll tell my doctor that have certain symptoms for a certain amount of time then the doctor turns around and says something to make me think he did not listen to me. There are times that he can tell me things and I have no idea what he is talking about because he is using medical terms that I'm not familiar with. Example, I had a full panel blood test and when the results came back in a nurse called to tell me that everything was normal but I had no idea what exactly they are testing for and what it means now that the results were normal. 
0.883300	I feel like I am very able and comfortable obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, using resources such as my spouse, friends and the internet.
0.916700	I know how to analyze data properly. Also its very basic just listening skills not really much to explain there, so not sure what you are looking for with this. 
0.916700	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to make good health decisions. I don't get shy or nervous about asking questions when I feel I don't understand something. Part of a doctors job is to educate and explain things that you may not understand or fully grasp.
0.661100	I really like my Dr so getting the information I need is pretty easy.  The issue is sometimes remembering everything that was said.  He does give me the results of blood test so that helps. Remembering why and the importance of what he said is the issue.  I can always call the nurse however at any time and get a brief run down on the visit too if needed.  I feel like my Dr knowledge is what helps me make appropriate health decisions.  Plus he breaks it down pretty good.  
0.916700	I understand my medical conditions and have done a lot of research on health issues.  I do research before I even go to a doctor if it seems a new health issue has popped up.  I have also studied medical information and terminology to help out my parents with their medical conditions.  I try to be as informed as possible before any doctor visit.  I have always been able to absorb and understand medical information easily.
0.766700	I think I have the basic knowledge and understanding to feel fairly competent in comprehending my health situations. I know where to find the resources to make decisions if I need. I could probably be more thorough in my discussion, explanations, and and questioning of health professionals to ensure the highest level of efficient care. I probably make too many assumptions.
0.866700	I feel I am capable to obtain the information I need to make my health decisions the majority of the time.  My mother was a nurse so I was exposed to medical terms at an early age.  I am also a college graduate, English is my native language and i read and comprehend well.
0.800000	I feel that I am mostly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I have learned some information in high school and college about basic human health and over the years I have had encounters with government and health services.
0.916700	Having come from a family that is involved in the medical profession, I know that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.872200	I feel that there is sufficient explanation and help sources when it comes to understanding basic health information. The key really is keep it simple. Avoid big medical terms. I will check the internet also before making a decision.
0.844400	Regarding all the questions I just answered, I feel that I have a very high comprehension level to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate Health decisions
0.850000	I consider myself above average when it comes to understanding basic health information. I can read and comprehend, and have no qualms about asking for additional clarification when needed.
0.777800	I believe that in my experiences I have not needed much help with the entire experience of going to the doctor and anything related to it. I have been able to understand directions, fill out forms, and ask good questions. 
0.888900	Pretty well. If the doctor tells me something i make sure to keep it in my mind or even write it down. Health is not something to joke about and i have any questions i'm sure to tell him. But overall i understand why i need to take something or do somethin.
0.883300	I have the capacity  to understand this information and services on my own.  An example of a rare time when I would need help would be if I were in the hospital with a high fever or head injury that confuses me.  I would say that I am almost 100 percent capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding the given information alone.
0.800000	I feel relatively well versed in health related matters although I am not in the health profession. I read a lot about health and fitness.
0.872200	I feel like I am capable of getting the information necessary when visiting a medical professional. Depending on my current physical condition, I may be more prone to ask more questions compared to when I'm feeling very well.
0.794400	I can get easily overwhelmed with new information at appointments. I often forget to ask questions during appointments, and think of them later. This makes it difficult for me to make decisions when I am asked to make decisions while AT the appointment. Also, I don't always know that I am not being offered all possible options when being given options, and I don't always think to ask if I am being given all possible options. I think I have too much trust in my providers to actually do that. 
0.916700	I feel extremely capable of coming up with good questions, asking those questions, doing independent research, and understanding information I receive in order to make good health decisions for myself.
0.694400	I think I can understand basic health information. I probably can process health information if it is not too complicated, I ask the right questions, and the health provider is willing to give me thorough answers. Obtaining health information is something I can do by researching online, but obtaining health information from a doctor would be difficult without health insurance coverage.
0.838900	 I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, probably better than average. I say this because I do have a scientific background and enjoy reading and learning about diseases and medical conditions, so if I am told something I don't completely understand, I feel capable of doing the research and filling in any gaps in my understanding. I will also ask a doctor or nurse to clarify what they tell me if something is unclear to me.
0.916700	I did not always have health insurance, but shortly after Obamacare passed, I went to the private market to get my first health insurance policy. From the information at the website and the documents they sent me after purchasing my policy, I was able to fully comprehend exactly what my policy covered, where I could use it, and more. I've only had to use it once in the 8 years or so since I've had, but I was sure to get my questions asked regarding my policy at my doctor's office and everything went smoothly.
0.916700	I am confident that I am able to ask the necessary questions and have a good basic understanding of conditions I may have and services that may be recommended/required. I feel comfortable asking questions when unsure and can find resources whether it's my healthcare provider or elsewhere that will help me better understand the situation
0.916700	I feel that I am more than equipped and knowledgeable to be able to obtain, process, and understand anything regarding my basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision.  I have been taking care of myself via doctors and health care providers for over a decade and have never had any issues understanding or not knowing who to ask appropriate and valid questions to.  I am comfortable in the medical arena as I have had previous work experience in the medical field and was premed for two years in college before switching my major to business/accounting.
0.705600	I believe my understanding of the English language helps me to understand most forms. If I do receive information that I cannot clearly comprehend then I ask the assistance of friends and family who work in the medical field to make sure I can get the language in a more simple form. Luckily most of the medical forms I have had to fill out are made so that people can for the most part understand them. I am usually 85 percent confident that I can fill out and understand most forms
0.900000	I have the capacity to process and understand the information needed to manage my own health.I know what services to access and the means to reach them. I do sometimes need assistance communicating since my hearing has gotten worse but I find ways to mitigate that situation when needed. 
0.916700	I think I have a great capacity to understand basic health information and make appropriate decisions. If I do not understand something I am not shy about asking my provider to explain it in a different way. I am very apt to ask questions or to clarify when things are not clear to me. I also have the internet to look up things I am not so sure about.
0.727800	I think that for the most part I'm comfortable with making health decisions. I'm wary of doctors and I think people give them too much credit in their ability to diagnose people and prescribe the right medications. Mostly I like to have raw test results and with that I can research on my own and try to understand how to reverse engineer a physical problem I'm having and why it occurred. The body is very mechanical in nature and as such, most problem arises for very good reason. We're a product of evolution so it's best to look at our distant ancestors for clues on how to live healthily and without ailment.
0.811100	I am not always 100% confident that I understand everything I need to understand. However, I know enough that I trust I am making the right decisions for myself. Often, I lack 100% confidence simply because sometimes there is not a definite answer my physician can give me, and they cannot predict the future. Specifically I had a difficult pregnancy and really no one could give me an answer on why I had the problems I did. So I relied on my own research to try to get a better answer. 
0.733300	With all the changes that occur on a daily basis, I think it is not realistic to expect the public to keep up with what is right or appropriate when it comes to medicine.  I believe I can process the basic information but I know that to do things correctly, the basics do not always take care of everything that we need to know.  Obtaining the right information, now thanks to the internet, is easy to get you just have to make sure that the sites that you go to are reputable. 
0.661100	i believe that i can comprehend most of the medical documents i only have a problem when they require signatures and also when they use medical terminology to describe things that could be put simply. 
0.827800	I feel like I am mostly able to understand basic health information that is given to me. I occasionally feel too intimidated or uncomfortable to ask my doctor certain questions about my health, depending on the provider and the situation. Besides that, I am usually able to obtain the information that I need about my health.
0.838900	I feel confident obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information. I do feel some hesitation regarding a specific diagnoses that I have because there doesn't seem to be much concrete information and my doctor has to ask me questions it to gather more info for other patients. 
0.900000	To the degree that I can reference to other available, public information sources regarding the health information presented to me by doctors and nurses. I'm best at processing and understanding written information when taking the time to perform more research on the information in question.  
0.588900	I think I obtain at least somewhat of a basic understanding of the health information that was provided to me. I wish there was more explaining however, because they are times where I do not understand what is going on in some aspects of the application.
0.633300	Health information is very hard to understand and needs to be simplified. They have to remember doctors are not the ones reading the information. Its the patient.
0.916700	This may sound a bit pompous, but I have a fairly easy time understanding health information for two reason. First, I work in healthcare. I have worked in healthcare for 12 years. I'm also just smart. (See? Sounds conceited, but I don't mean it that way.) I am the one that every one of my family and friends come to for medical help or advice. 
0.855600	I have all the knowledge I need.  If there is something I am unsure about I have the resources available to me as I work in the health field.
0.850000	I have the capacity, but sometimes I'm in too much pain to be able to process everything I'm being told.  And doctors don't always tell you what you need to know.  Or they mislead you and talk you into things, including surgeries, that you wish you hadn't agreed to later.  (That's happened to me more than once.)
0.655600	sometimes it gets tough to cooperate when ready books before going to bed. I need lots of light and a activity around me.
0.811100	As a patient, I am about 70% confident that I have the capacity to obtain , process and understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. I have BA degree and always learn new health information myself, so I am comfortable with my level of capacity.
0.916700	I am adept at reading medical reports. I remember all the medicines that I take and their dosages.If I don't understand something, I can usually ask a receptionist or a curse. I am fully versed in all my diagnoses.
0.900000	I feel that, within myself, I have more than adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services I need to make appropriate health decisions. Whether or not the information and services are actually available and of a quality that will help is another matter.
0.538900	I can understand basic health information regarding my diagnosis. I can obtain a basis understanding from pamphlets that I've received from the doctor regarding my specific medical condition. The dialogue between the doctor and I usually does not go further than this because of very limited time constraints. When they had my info over to a staff after a 3 minute discussion, it brings me to square one because the nurses usually aren't there during that part of the conversation.
0.872200	I feel like I have a decent enough grasp of medical terminology and my health conditions that I can make good decisions by myself in consultation with my medical team. I rarely ask for help understanding medical information given to me or filling out forms.
0.850000	I feel that I can make my own decisions up to certain appoint, until I might possibly receive some bad news about my health, then I will turn to my husband to help me make those difficult decisions as to where we go from there. 
0.900000	I feel that I understand most information about health conditions. Sometimes I need more clarification when it comes to the workings of health insurance policies and other related documents. Once it is explained to me semi thoroughly, I have no problem processing and understanding this information though.
0.866700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand health information.  I feel very confident in my ability to do so.  I am not afraid to ask questions when I need clarifying, and I am always eager to take the time to read and learn about my own health conditions so that I can make the best decisions for myself possible.
0.855600	I feel very confident in my ability to read and understand medical info presented for laypeople. There's a lot of information available in a lot of places and I can usually tell the wheat from the chaff, and when I'm talking to professionals, I know enough to understand or ask about what I do not. 
0.794400	Generally I feel I can understand health information needed services.  I usually pester my doctor asking questions and even repeating them if I feel that is necessary.  Often, when I get home I will research information on medications and medical issues on the Internet if I do not fully understand them.  I will also ask my spouse as she is quite knowledgable about these things. 
0.644400	I believe I have the understanding to make basic health decisions. However, in the cases where there are specific issues (such as dermatology), they quickly explain the condition you are facing and prescribe some medications (trial and error). Often times, they expect you to remember everything they say in the office. In the slight chance they write something down, it is often only a few words.
0.888900	In my experience all of the health care professionals I've worked with have done a very good job explaining any relevant information to me, and given me whatever choices are appropriate to my situation. I also have a degree in Biology that maybe helps me further understand some of the general information presented to me about health and anatomy. 
0.883300	I ask questions and read the information I'm given.  I have also talked to friends or relatives that have had the same or similar problems.  I had 1 minor and 3 major surgeries and lot's of tests last year.
0.916700	I have had an interest in medicine since childhood, having grown up in my father's pharmacy.  I am the gatekeeper and knowledge authority for my family's healhcare and am fully informed on all their medical conditions.  I have a kong0-standing open relationship with my primary care physician and the specialists I see.  I have also been the primary caregiver for my mother when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and advocated aggressively for her care.
0.633300	I feel like a have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I say this because besides medical professionals explaining things verbally, they can also give you information/papers to take home. There is also a plethora of information available to those who need to look up information online, given that the people looking up things online does take their research as a self-diagnosis.
0.822200	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand health information given to me. If I don't understand anything at all I ask until I get the answer I need. Sometimes I feel like a problem patient because the Dr or Nurse get a bit frustrated but that's their job and my job is to keep track and fully understand my own health as a bottom line. I learned this all the hard way by not asking questions in a previous situation and only became more ill. I think we pay for this information so we should understand it even if we have to go through many people to get it.
0.883300	pretty much completely. Prescription drug information that is written by the manufacture is needlessly complicated as well and the info about clinical trials though.
0.838900	I feel confident that I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  If I have questions, I could speak with my doctor or nursing staff to find answers.  If the answers were too technical, I would feel comfortable asking for clarification.
0.794400	I feel that even though I am not a medical professional, I am able to ask questions until I feel confident that I understand the gist of the information about my medical needs and care. I do not always understand what is initially said to me or provided to me in writing but I feel confident that I am able to discuss with the medical provider the information until I understand it for the most part. I also have the ability to use an internet search engine to help me understand information as well.
0.916700	I feel I am 100% confident in my health information and choices that I make.  I am in good health and hopefully I will remain that way for awhile.
0.750000	I feel like I am in a good position to do these things, but that is because I am somewhat intelligent. I feel like healthcare professionals are open to answering any questions that I may have and willing to do so in terms that I can understand. The only thing that I am not confident in is my ability to obtain all the information I need. Sometimes I am confused about where to go to obtain information.
0.788900	I think depending on the person explaining things, I can grasp the concept. And when I need more information I will ask for more.  I don't feel confident that I know the right questions to ask though.
0.861100	I feel that I have full capacity to recieve and comprehend health information that is given to me. I am able to clarify information if needed and usually ask questions if something is confusing.
0.777800	Depending on which people I interact with I am mostly capable of doing this. There have been certain doctors and nurses I have run into that do not listen, do not believe what you say, and act like it is beneath therm to explain things to you that you do not understand
0.766700	I used to work as a nurse, but it has been many years and a lot of health related treatments and information has changed since then. Many times I can research a topic online before visiting my doctor to find out questions I may need to ask. Often I find that times have changed and new information is available that I didn't know about.
0.705600	I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain and understand such information, but the problem is often how insistent I feel that I need to be in order to get it. Another problem arises when there is more information needed to properly understand certain medical situations including specific policies and practices, but if one is not aware of the extent to which such information exists and therefore demands it and insists on thoroughly reading it, one is not offered it.
0.716700	I feel that I am confident in making health decisions. I know that I can always ask questions of those with a better understanding if something confuses me. If I don't understand something that they have said, I often look their answers up on line so that I can see it worded in normal language. 
0.916700	I feel I'm at full capacity to understand and comprehend any medical information provided to me.  I've had 100s of appointments throughout my lifetime with little to no misunderstandings.
0.794400	In regards to all of the questions that I just answered, I feel that I completely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when I am presented with information and materials that explain health information and services in an accurate way and when I take the time necessary to read through the materials without being rushed.
0.750000	I can usually comprehend and understand most of what a doctor or nurse says. I try to have them repeat anything I don't understand. A few instances, I did not accept their evaluations or diagnoses.
0.916700	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have always had an interest in the medical field and worked in a hospital for a brief time about 30 years ago. I read a lot of online sources and follow news about medical issues and advances so I consider myself to be competent enough about most medical issues to get and deal with any relevant health information or services I might need to make the right health choices.
0.688900	I think that what I would really need is a friend to help me.  I would probably have to repeat things back to the provider.  I'm not fully skilled.
0.677800	I believe I have a very good grasp on obtaining and understanding medical materials regarding my own health, whether I need help with it sometimes or not. In addition to having people around who could help me, I feel rather comfortable asking my doctor for help and if I still need help, I'll either research online or ask others.
0.811100	I am as capable as anyone at understanding health information provided to me, but health is very specific and individual and I believe often that doctors speak in generalities because to do more would require more time than they have to offer or I want to pay for.  So some specifics, or details that would make my situation different from the norm, get lost unless I continue to have a problem that warrants further specific attention.
0.655600	I think I am a pretty intelligent person and I can usually infer what people are trying to communicate with me. Sometimes the technical words confuse me a bit.
0.816700	I have experience in some areas of health because in college I participated in health studies and read a lot of literature.Nowadays is easier to get new information about a specific health-related topic on the internet. 
0.916700	I am able to read and understand most materials given to me by doctors. My primary care doctor is very willing to get me more printed information if I request it and sometimes does it on his own.
0.811100	Well I am pretty knowledgeable myself in medical field, as my wife is self taught health adviser. It is very easy for me to understand and process basic health information as well as services in order to make the right decision. I have hardly ever had any problems regarding the basic information about health.
0.883300	I have a science background, so the terminology is relatively easy for me to understand. In addition to communicating with health care professionals, I also do research on line with regard to my conditions.
0.711100	I feel like I have good understanding of how to make an appropriate health decisions. I feel confident that I understand the basic process of obtaining the information I need to understand the health information and services.
0.888900	To a very high degree, I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I think it helps me a bit to work in the Healthcare industry. But even if I did not, I feel the forms are really straightforward and the paperwork after the doctor's visit is very informative and easy to read as well. Even the information that comes attached to the medication is not so bad. Although, the names of the medications can be difficult to pronounce the instructions and descriptions are pretty straight forward. 
0.855600	Even though I don't have a medical (or even remotely Science) background, I believe that I understand basic information and services to make suitable health decisions. The only time this gets confusing is when there is something new/totally unfamiliar.
0.605600	I think I can understand and process a lot of the information given to me by health professionals, but sometimes I need to get an extra opinion to maybe help explain it further to me. I also like to talk things out and I could have missed something so it's always good to have someone else look at the information and try to explain it to you.
0.666700	I believe that I am very capable of understanding my health information and services. I am able to make appropriate health decisions. I would prefer to have a second opinion or confirmation from someone I trust if possible, just to be sure that I understand correctly. 
0.861100	I believe I have a high degree of capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am able to read, discern, and listen to the information that is being provided to me by my doctors. Additionally, if I don't understand something I will tell my doctors my concerns and listen to their opinion in order to make the best decision.I would also read about it using reliable sources.
0.844400	I feel that I have the capacity to understand the information that my doctor gives me. I also have the capacity to fill out medical forms.
0.827800	The processing and understanding are rarely an issue, it's really about getting the information I need to do these things that is the problem.  Usually when I go to the doctor I am a bit stressed so I forget to ask pertinent questions.  Then realize it after leaving.  When I get home I often try to call them but rarely get a response right away.  I most often times find what I need on the internet. Days later I will get a response from the doctors nurse.
0.777800	I think I can comprehend all the basics I may need to know although I may need to ask to have some things clarified if they are told in terms that I do not understand.
0.888900	I feel very capable regarding all health related information. I do have a degree in Nursing, so that gives me a great advantage. There are still things that I have questions on at times, or do not understand.
0.766700	I feel that I have a good grasp on the basics of how the human body works. As long as it pertains to one of the systems, IE respiratory, circulatory, it is fairly easy to understand. When the illness in question gets deeper than that, to the smaller functions of the body, is when it becomes difficult to understand.
0.677800	I sometimes feel I don't understand the terms and descriptions that the nurse/doctors are telling me.  A lot of times I get off the phone or get home and feel confused about the information I have been given.  I end up thinking of numerous additional questions I should have asked.
0.750000	"I am very bad at talking to my doctors because a I often don't want to ""make a fuss"" or I just assume that there isn't really anything they can do so I let it go. "
0.883300	I am in the medical field so I have indepth knowledge about medicine. Because of this most of my professional that I see speak to me as equal and not dumb it down. 
0.916700	I feel I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.  And if there is something I don't understand or am not clear on, I can either ask or get answers from a different source.  
0.866700	well I know abit about the terms and all that from biology and medical classes in school, so I know a bit about what they are talking about even if its in latin. figuring out all the insurance stuff is actually the biggest hassle i've had 
0.633300	I have no medical background, however I have been to the doctor plenty of times. I feel I have the mental capacity to understand the basic information, some of it just confuses me. Thankfully, my wife is a nurse :)
0.694400	I usually understand everything that is in a medical document that I must review, understand and sign. However, occasionally I am in a situation (such as when I was diagnosed with prostate cancer where I did not totally understand some of the information I read or that was explained to me by the physician). In cases like these sometimes my wife does a better job of explaining the issue to me in clear terms that I understand. However, in general I usually am able to comprehend everything that is being discussed with me in the doctor's office.
0.655600	When I have an issue I always try to do a lot of research. When speaking with a doctor sometimes it is more complicated to understand. I sometimes feel a little insure when trying to be so accurate about the information everyone needs to help diagnose.
0.883300	I feel i am above average in my understanding of health care and health care related issues, also i have a decent understanding of some basic biology which makes understanding a lot of issues more intuitive. I like to ask pertinent questions and try to challenge the doctor when i am experiencing an illness, and usually by the time i am talking to a doctor i have a list of questions i have derived from my own research before the appointment, many times my guess to the diagnosis proves to match that of the doctor. Sometimes even when the doctor disagrees and offers his own diagnosis in the end my guess proves to be correct after some trial and error.  
0.800000	It it not the hard nowadays to understand medical advice or diagnosis. This is due to th wide ranging information available on the internet
0.900000	I feel VERY confident that i am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am not yet of the age that any dementia has set in and I feel i have full mental capacity to obtain and process that information
0.855600	I AM CONFIDENT IN MY ABILITIES TO UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION. I AM 48 YEARS OLD AND HAVE HAD NOT ONLY MY OWN EXPERIENCES OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS BUT ALSO ABOUT 20 YEARS OF DEALING WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CONCERNING MY 3 CHILDREN.
0.816700	I believe I do have the capacity to effectively obtain, process and understand basic health information. I believe I can make appropriate health decisions with my own knowledge supplemented by the knowledge of healthcare professionals whom I consult with. I am confident that far more often than not, I can come to the best possible decisions regarding my health when using an approach that adequately takes into account all information and data that I have.
0.605600	I think if given access to adequate and accurate information and allowed sufficient time to proceed this information, I should be able to gain a greater understanding of my medical condition and to be able to make better health decisions. Also, the opportunity to have my questions answered in a nonjudgmental way is also necessary to achieve this goal.  
0.883300	I feel that I can get basic health information when needed.  When I go to the doctor, I make sure to have all my questions and concerns written down so I do not forget them.  If there are any issues with medical forms, I am sure to ask a secretary for that information.  
0.916700	I feel very confident of being able to fill out and understand basic health information forms and other things.  I am a pretty smart person and my health is very important to me.  If I need any help I can ask and get the help I need.  
0.816700	Plenty and what i don't know i would ask the appropriate people to help me out with it. Doctor, nurse etc. I feel confident though that i could do it on my own as i already have access to my health information through my drs. portal.
0.694400	I think that I am cable and understand basic health information and services. If I need help with anything I try to look online and then ask a professional for their opinion.
0.900000	I feel I am more than capable to understand the information my doctor's give me as well as the ability to seek out any additional information I may want or need. if u don't fully understand anything I am confident that if u ask my doctor's will have answers for me.
0.916700	I think I can understand everything. I read it slowly and over again if I need to. Then I look up information that I don't quite get.
0.805600	I feel as though the standard provisioning of materials is sufficient for me to understand what information is important and needs to be factored into any decision.
0.672200	Iâm not a doctor and Iâd never like to be, it scares me just thinking about it, but I like to investigate everything thatâs concerns my health like how my body works, how it reacts to certain medications, what I need to be healthy, so I pay attention to all and try to learn about it so I know how to make future decisions.
0.661100	I feel fairly capable of understanding basic health information. When that information goes beyond the basics it is a different story. Anything I am still confused about I will usually search for online.
0.900000	I absolutely have the capacity to make my own health decisions. I'm very familiar with medicine and healthcare and am very comfortable understanding jargon and no problems with the settings. Even if I wasn't, I'm well educated and more than equipped with handling what comes my way, including managing and understanding health information.
0.650000	Sometimes I feel the need to research information outside of what the nurse or doctor provides. They're not always thorough when they explain conditions or health concerns. They're especially vague about medications. I don't feel it is enough to just explain how and when to take medication. I should be thoroughly informed of possible side effects before it is prescribed. Once a medication is prescribed the doctor always seems reluctant to change the prescription regardless of the side effects. Many times I have to choose between continuing a medication that has terrible effects and is sometimes ineffective to treat a condition or discontinuing it altogether. When that happens the doctor thinks I am simply not following their recommendation when it is really due to bad side effects that I cannot live with. I am capable of understanding and following the doctor's instructions but sometimes they don't understand why I am unable to continue with their recommendations.
0.872200	I'm pretty insistent on getting questions answered. On the other hand, I have found doctors and nurses to be kind of vague sometimes and rushed. So on my end, I'm pretty confident in my ability to ask the right questions, but not always confident that I will get clear, decisive answers. 
0.827800	I think my abilities are pretty adequate in regards to this scenario. I have a good vocabulary- and I know a smattering about many medical conditions. However, I am nervous in a medical setting- and just draw a blank on questions I should be asking during the course of an examination, or probable diagnosis.
0.833300	I feel I am 100% capable of understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services. This is because of years of experience handling my own medical information with no help. 
0.816700	Every time I am finding myself interacting with the medical situations I make sure I ask the physician all the necessary questions. I listen carefully and make sure I have things written down. I also make sure to get everything what's needed from the front desk, such as follow-ups or appointments.
0.850000	I feel that I am highly capable of obtaining the help I need to make appropriate health decisions. When I pick physicians I look for ones that are personable and beyond willing to make me fell comfortable. All of my physicians go over and beyond to make sure I have anything I need and understand all medical information. I am also prone to research things that I am unfamiliar with via the internet. 
0.411100	It is very hard to obtain it all. With my condition I cannot remember a lot of things and cannot understand the terms that the doctor use. I get afraid to ask them for simple terms or written information so that I can go home and read lated
0.566700	I feel that I have the basic services needed to help me to understand health information that I may not necessarily understand on my own. Services in my hometown and well as my local hospital and pharmacy are always willing and available to ask for assistance when needed and are also friendly as to make asking for help as painless and easy as possible. 
0.738900	I feel like I have a good capacity to understand health information, since I am going into a health field. I sometimes find it difficult to tell doctors everything I planned to
0.872200	Firstly, I am a retired registered nurse so should be able to effectively read and understand medical information.  But, as any patient, I sometime don't want to give all the necessary information to my provider (silly, I know), but it's human.  Sometimes also, because of my medical background, I don't ask questions I want to because I feel the provider thinks I should already know the answer.  I sometimes have to remind the providers that they can't assume I know something about my medical condition because I am a nurse.  There may be new information I don't know or I may have forgotten the information.
0.572200	I think I have basic understanding of my medical conditions but I wish I was more educated about how my body works, more importantly how and why my body has certain issues that negatively effect my life.  I often have to do my own internet research because medical professionals sugar coat things for me.
0.872200	I feel like I have all the capacity needed to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have not found any situations through any of my medical needs (a couple of surgeries, procedures, and just normal every day needs) when I could not clearly understand the information given to me or get my questions answered. 
0.761100	I think that I need to learn more to understand clearly the medical terms and in that way to have a broader perspective of the diagnosis to evaluate each possibility and obtain more recommendation as far as my health is concerned.
0.872200	I feel very capable of obtaining and understanding my health information. I know how to find services to use to make health decisions when necessary. If I need help understanding something I use resources provided to find out the meaning.
0.722200	At times I have a little bit of brain fog that keeps me from comprehending things immediately. Iâm not sure where this comes from. Usually, if I re-read things a number of times I will comprehend it. It helps if I read with a pencil so I can underline, or make notes. Most doctors visits go ok for me, but if I think it will be an important appointment I will take my wife with me to help me think and ask questions. If I donât bring my wife I often forget everything that was said in the appointment after about five minutes.
0.883300	I have a high degree because I am of sound health of mind and have resources to back me up. I have people close to me who are MDs and know how to find information by myself.
0.888900	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions to a great degree. On the rare occasion I don't understand something, even after asking for clarification, I reach out to my mother who is a registered nurse. 
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have access to the information I need and can make informed decisions. Once in awhile I will have a hard time remembering some information I've been given or I'll forget to ask the doctor a question, but it's rare.
0.883300	I feel that while I am not a health expert I do have the ability to listen to what the doctors say and I can understand what I am told so that I am able to understand what I am being told by them.
0.672200	I feel that most of the time I can understand medical information if it is explained to me in broad basic terms that can be understood by a normal non medical person.  If the information is written in complex medical jargon I might need someone who understands it to explain it to me.  Generally when I am at the doctors office generally they will speak in basic terms I will understand them, but If I am presented with some medical terminology then I might ask the doctor or nurse to elaborate.
0.888900	I feel that I can adequately understand and process the information I need. I usually don't need help with it wither.
0.866700	I feel that I am fully capable of both understanding and knowing how and when to ask question so I do.  I work for a hospital so I am very familiar with a lot of the instructions.  I also always make sure I understand as I do not want to have to come back later.
0.916700	I am capable to understand basic health information.  I have to deal with it with my parents, with someone I took care of and a friend.  I can also find out information on the computer when needed for basic health information.  I also have a cousin and a friend who are nurses but I did work in the medical field for about a year.
0.761100	I think there is a lot of information on the internet.  I also know enough people in the medical profession that I can get clarification on anything that I didn't understand.  
0.888900	I believe that I can understand health information when it comes to prescription drugs and I have some idea of a possible diagnosis because I always go online beforehand and do a search if I'm having symptoms that I'm not familiar with. I also feel that I'm competent enough understanding instructions on my own.
0.783300	I believe I can make appropriate health decisions if I ask the right questions and have good doctors and medical staff available. Sometimes doctors don't want to give direct answers because, I believe, they are afraid of lawsuits or my claiming they said something they did not. I would like it if they would put everything in simple language so that everyone could understand exactly what they're talking about. 
0.600000	I have been going to the doctor for my health issues for a while now and I feel I have gotten pretty good at filling out all the proper paper work but I do notice sometimes if I don't right down questions too ask I will become overwhelmed and forget to ask those questions the problem that I find id a lot of doctors and nurses are in such a hurry they make you feel very rushed and it feels like they are not listening to you that is why I always bring someone with me to help me remember everything
0.844400	I feel I have the (mental) capacity to obtain, process an understand medical information presented to me and I possess the ability to ask questions of medical personnel when needed.  Additionally, I have access to medical sources online and I have a niece who is local and is a certified nurse.
0.833300	i feel very confident in my ability to fill forms or read information about an illness, so this help me to make the appropiate decisions when are relate to my health
0.827800	I feel like I have decent capability to understand health information enough to make decisions about my own health. I try to ask my doctor about terms and diagnoses that I have difficulty understanding and see what he thinks it will mean to my future health decisions. I do research about about my health issues online as well, but mainly to help further understand medical terms and such, not as a primary source of information.
0.711100	I have an issue especially with most doctors hand writing. It's generally not legible. Secondly, medical staff are not always available to answer all the questions I may have. As such, I feel not very sufficiently equipped to understand basic health information.
0.916700	Whenever I speak to a medical practitioner, I generally take notes. In between visits, should a question come up, I write it down and keep it in my medical notebook so that I remember to ask. I am not afraid to ask questions regarding my health, but I feel that sometimes doctors or nurses are so overwhelmed by their duties that they don't give much, or very clear, information. I have no issues retaining the information, it just needs to be given.
0.788900	I feel I have have a large ability to process basic health decisions. I am biased though, as I have a degree in human physiology, was an EMT, and am about to attend physician assistant school in May. However, before going to college, I did have a very hard time understanding what was being told to me by PCPs and felt what they told me was poorly explained. It seemed they did not care to explain conditions to me since they were in a hurry. This, in addition to complicated medical and insurance forms, made it very difficult to gain anything from visiting the doctor.
0.616700	I've never really had any confidence in dealing with this kind of stuff on my own. I've always been a rather sheltered and dependent person, so depending on the importance, I'd prefer it if someone were to go over it with me or walk me through it to minimize errors. I don't do anything like this that often either, so I'm sure if I had more practice, I'd be all right on my own.
0.916700	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. My education is in Biomedical Science and I have some insight.
0.883300	I think when it comes to making decisions about my health, I feel that I'm fully capable of interpreting what the doctor's are saying and asking a lot of questions.  I tend to ask about alternatives to treatments depending on what the recommendations are.  I tend to trust what my doctor's say because I have a long standing history with them and they have a proven track record of having positive recommendations.  Any literary information I receive I'm fully capable of reading and understanding and usually do additional research myself.  The only thing I do is I have my husband take care of understanding the side effects of my medication so I don't get super anxious and dwell about the side effects.  I just let him know if I start feeling weird. I also make most of my decisions with my husband so that I have a support system.
0.916700	I don't have any difficulty in reading or processing or conveying any of the health information. I am at ease with it.
0.850000	I think that most of the information I'm given is fairly easy to understand. If I don't understand something I will ask the Doctor or Nurse to explain it to me as easily as possible.
0.855600	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand issues regarding my basic health. I am able to read and understand documents and instructions given by my doctors. 
0.666700	It depends on the information, I need help understanding it sometimes when there is a emergency my mind just does not process the information and get confused on trhe details of it.
0.888900	Prior to my cancer diagnosis in 2012, I had a 10 year work history in the emergency department of our local hospital.  Also, in my 20's I worked for 5 years in the same hospital this time as a nursing assistant in the pediatric ward.  I do believe I have a substantial understanding of most health issues, not counting my own.  I also raised 4 daughters alone and the youngest has a history of severe asthma, so hospitals, dr's and nurses are second nature to me.
0.794400	I think I have a sufficient capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. Sometimes I feel the need to look online, ask a family member or contact the doctor for further information. However, I am usually confident in making health decisions myself. 
0.588900	I have some capacity  to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Sometimes I feel like i would need some help from others.
0.750000	I don't feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process the health information I need. I always feel rushed at the doctor's office. I get nervous and forget to ask the important questions I should ask. I get my blood taken every 3 months because I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I take medications to control these conditions and both are hereditary based. My understanding is just okay at best. Because it is hereditary and not based on foods I eat, it is difficult to get a full explanation of what I can do differently other than changing my eating habits and daily exercise. I want to know more about my risks and they really don't go into that. 
0.916700	I feel extremely confident of my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decision. I had been in situations where I was provided with information about some medical procedures and I was able to make the right decisions. The last situation I remember was my tuba ligation. I sat down with the doctor first then the nurse they give me all the information about the procedure and give me the chance to ask questions that they answered and no one helped me understand or make any decision concerning the procedure.
0.883300	My father was an M.D. as was my maternal grandfather. I was raised to become an M.D. I chose physics. Regardless, I grew up surrounded by medical discussions and spend a great deal of time with health-care professionals and as a consequence am extremely comfortable with them, asking them questions, and challenging them. Obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information to make appropriate health choices is something I'm very comfortable with.
0.688900	I believe that I can understand most information that doctors tell me but sometimes i ask family members who work in health care so they can advise me. I also look up information online and then I make the decisions.
0.700000	I feel like I have a moderate ability to understand things on my own immediately.  But, there are many times that I will have to get on the internet to do the research so that I understand things completely.  I am the type of person that needs to make a list to take with me so I don't forget questions I have, and to list symptoms.  Sometimes though there are too many choices and I feel like I want to do the correct thing, and wonder if I will.  
0.816700	I usually understand everything medical professionals tell me, and I try to do research on the internet before a visit so that I can speak with some degree of knowledge. Still, it's not like I'm a medical professional myself, so I mostly give the symptoms and leave it in the hands of the professionals to decide how to proceed. Results vary from doctor to doctor.
0.866700	I feel confident I have the capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information and services needed regarding my health decisions.  I am able to focus and retain information and I when I don't understand something, I do not hesitate to ask the provider.
0.850000	I feel very capable. My husband handles all the paperwork for my family, though. So I don't really have any recent intricate experience with that.
0.916700	I have been reading about health my whole life. I am very interested in my health so I try to obtain as much as I can to make sure I stay healthy. When my doctor tells me something I listen to make sure that I stay healthy.
0.644400	I think I have those capacity at least the same level with average people.If there is something I really don't understand even if I ask to the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist, I can ask her/him to write down or spell out so I  check on the internet and will understand most of things and be able to make appropriate health decision.
0.400000	I really never understand most of what the doctor is saying about my condition. I feel really stupid for asking questions about it because when I do ask questions I get the vibe that the doctors think I'm stupid. I sometimes will ask a few questions but by the end I am shaking my head like I fully understand when actually I have no clue. 
0.650000	I feel I have the full ability to understand what ever medical problems I am dealing with. Any traditional diseases that I can come across I have learned about and am pretty sure that I will have the necessary knowledge to know what I'm dealing with
0.722200	Yes, I do think I could understand basic health information and services to make good health decisions. I know at my age now, I would not have a problem at this time. When I advance a little more in years, I might need more help.
0.883300	I feel I can communicate well with medical staff.  I Don't have problems reading or understanding things, an I make sure I ask questions about anything I don't understand.
0.844400	I do.  I feel confident in my ability to understand what a doctor says to me and also in my ability to research health topics on my own.  I also feel that I have access to people who are more well-informed than I am.  There are several nurses and doctors within my social circle who I could ask for guidance if I needed it.  I do have a slight amount of distrust in the medical community because of my experience giving birth in the hospital versus giving birth at home.  This makes me feel like I need to do a little research on whatever has been told to me by a medical professional.  
0.722200	I have the capacity to understand basic health information but because I have severe anxiety, sometimes I don't catch things the first time they are said or my thoughts are so jumbled I have a hard time asking questions I should ask. 
0.833300	I feel I have a great deal of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can read very well and I am very good at asking questions. Usually if I have any problems I can use the internet to help me if needed. 
0.700000	I feel like I do a good job at asking enough questions to understand what is being told to me and if I have to do something to fix it. I usually do my research and would call back to talk to my doctor or a nurse and understand more if I have questions. For the most part I think I retain a lot of what they say to me. 
0.705600	Even though I do not pretend to know everything about my health prognosis and course of action, every time I go to the doctor's office I make sure before leaving that I have a minimum understanding of my current overall status, the next course of action and desired results. 
0.888900	I believe I have a strong capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and to make decision regarding my own health. I don't have too much trouble processing my health related information that I get from healthcare providers
0.872200	I feel very confident that I can obtain and understand basic health information.  I usually feel comfortable asking the needed questions to better understand my doctor and if there's any suggestions to improve my health.  I am willing to try what my doctor thinks is best, and use whatever resources are available to me.
0.883300	I feel that I have a big ability to fill out required paperwork and if there is room questions about my health. I also feel that I can ask health personnel any questions to clarify anything I need clarification on.
0.677800	recently i had a kid. After he born we are going to take him to doctor for monthly checkups. We came to know the process of handling kids and each time we go for checkup nurse provides us a plan for next few months. I think this will help us to know all things. There are few instructions as well if baby is facing any health issue. It simply helps us to know how to treat babies while they are not feeling good. Pediatricians also helps us to know things. I came to know and understand the process how they are treating.
0.844400	I think that i am quite capable in speaking with medical staff. I have to make decisons medically for an older relative and my sick children. I have a working knowledge of medicine and an interest. 
0.727800	I think I still have a good mind and can remember most things and I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something.
0.600000	I have no trouble understanding basic health information as it's given to me as long as its in layman terms.  My problem with comprehending health information is when they don't translate test results into basic english and leave it as medical jargon. Also, I find that a lot of the times when it comes to payment it seems like they intentionally leave is as hard to understand as possible, to get you to give up and comply. 
0.811100	I recently went to the doctor's a few days ago, this was my first time going back since I was 18. It's been nearly 6 years since my last visit, and I was given so many forms and documents to fill out, with some ambiguous questions that could mean this-or-that and I didn't want to make a mistake. It was slightly difficult, and kind of nerve-wrecking.
0.850000	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. I am an excellent reader and can comprehend most things I read. 
0.538900	Sometimes health questions and health forms are a little hard to understand. I feel as if i can fill out my own forms they are just sometimes hard to understand
0.811100	I feel like I have a pretty good comprehension, and even if I don't know a term, I can read up and educate myself on a topic all on my own. I also feel that I do tell doctors my symptoms, but I tend to be pretty anxious, so I don't always ask all the questions that maybe I really should.
0.783300	I am fairly confident I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health info. Sometimes the info can be overwhelming and I may seek clarification or explanation from another source but after going over things a few times I am sure I can get the gist of it.
0.694400	I feel that I have the knowledge to understand about 75% of what is presented to me by doctors and nurses. They typically ask if I understand but to be honest typically when first presented with complex information it takes me a minute to process it.
0.711100	I'm pretty good at absorbing information, as if my brain were a sponge, especially when it comes to my health or the health of others. I am quite confident that I'd be able to process and understand basic information regarding health because of this care that I have for other people and myself. Therefore, I'm confident that being able to understand this basic health information and services, that I'm also confident I'd be able to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I think I'm able to process medical info fairly easily. I've had a lot of hospitalizations in my lifetime and I studied bio and psych in college so I can capably read my own cbcs and most of my test results without needing much explanation. 
0.883300	I have no problem understanding information that's been given or told to me when speaking with a doctor or pharmaceutical technician 
0.733300	I feel like I am able to handle myself at a clinic appointment.  At times I will need help on where to go and how to schedule folllow ups.
0.533300	I do understand somethings when it comes to the basic health information we receive, but donât really understand some terms they use for explaining what it really is. My wife is some what in that feels so she explains a lot to me.  Based off the little I know and my wife knowledge I feel that I will make the right decisions.
0.855600	I feel that I am quite able to understand, process or obtain what I need to make appropriate health decisions.  If I do not understand something or know what I need to do in situation I would ask the appropriate people or find the information needed.
0.833300	I am certain I have a lot of the information. With the advent of the internet as a resource, I can always google for more information on specific terms. My main concern is what the doctor thinks and what, if anything I should be doing for preventative care. That's just as important as understanding the medicine I've been prescribed.
0.844400	I think that I have a good awareness of my body, and how it usually functions.  Therefore I feel confident in my abilities to find out when something is off.  If they use medical language that I have not heard of, or is confusing to me, I have the cognitive capacity to ask for clarification.  I've never left an office visit feeling lost or confused due to medical jargon.
0.827800	I do feel that I have the ability to make appropriate decisions. If something is confusing, I may search for more information on the internet or ask people for their opinions/experience. Sometimes I might not realize I have a question until I have left the Drs. office, and that is when I will look elsewhere. If I'm really not sure, I would call my Drs. office back. 
0.883300	I am an educated person with no mental deficiencies; at this point I feel capable of getting the information I need. However, I find it very difficult to navigate medical insurance issues, possibly because the industry seems to make it deliberately difficult for the consumer. And I am not confident that I will be able to function in the same way in my old age. 
0.583300	I feel  i have adequate skills to read and obtain my health information. Sometimes though it is hard to get access to my doctors when I need them. 
0.916700	I always pay attention to what I am told in regards to my health, so I feel that I have a great capacity to understand lots of information in regards to my health. I am competent to make quality decisions in regards to my health because of this.  
0.783300	I feel that I am moderately capable of understanding medical things. I do not feel overly confident in my knowledge, but I have always had the ability to ask questions and get clarification if there is something that I am unsure of. I feel like doctors often use big words that are complicated to understand, when in fact it can be simplified in a way that can easily be understood. Often if I do not understand those big words, I will ask them to dumb it down for me. 
0.572200	Doctors are honestly so crabby so I rarely feel like I'm able to process what they're telling me fast enough to even formulate the questions I need to as. Given that, I rarely leave the doctor's office feeling like I understand my health information or what is being recommended for me. For example, I don't understand why I was instructed to get a thyroid test done so I never did it. I didn't understand if it was a light recommendation or if it was really necessary. And in terms of processing, I feel like they're always going too fast for me kind of like I said before. 
0.766700	I feel like I can understand most medical forms that I have to fill out at the doctor. I can understand the pamphlets that the makeup. But I don't feel like I get enough information to understand test results. Even if you ask for a copy, it is in jargon that normal people can't understand. When I ask to have the results interpreted, I just normally get a quick answer, like its normal or its high. But I don't understand it fully. Sometimes I get better more in-depth information on the internet. But then I worry that the source is maybe not accurate. 
0.916700	I feel  like I am well educated enough to fully understand everything I need to be able to obtain, process and understand all the basic health information that is provided to me by any medical practitioner that I would potentially visit. 
0.744400	I often re-read the medical forms to be sure I am answering them to the best of my ability but I find myself holding back questions for doctors because I don't feel comfortable in my own abilities in sounding educated. I am in constant pain from fibromyalgia and have had difficulty in finding a doctor that won't just give me some pills for depression and send me on my way. 
0.866700	I have the full degree and understanding to make health care decisions. I am fully understanding of my health care decisions. I have noone to help me overall and have no choice but to be fully understand my own healthcare choices.
0.811100	when ever i go to see the doctor, i ask questions over what i am not clear about and they take their time to explain to me and make me understand everything i need to know. so with that i can make all the decision i need.
0.916700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain any information that I need. I'm not afraid to ask when I have questions and I have healthcare providers that are willing to explain things to me as many time as they need to.
0.883300	I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make my own health decisions. In the past I have never had problems concerning such health decisions and am positive that in the future I continue doing the same.
0.811100	I've worked in the healthcare field over 10 years.  I'm pretty confident in my ability to understand basic health information.  Granted there are still somethings I need help with. 
0.816700	"I feel like I have no problems reading, understanding, and processing basic health information provided to me when obtaining medical care/treatment. I'm able to understand and have enough medical background that I don't have many problems at doctor's offices/hospitals.  Pharmaceutical information can be trickier, but it and other complicated medical information which is harder to understand can also be ""googled"" nowadays, which I have confidence in."
0.455600	Im pretty good when i go see a doctor.  I usually alwaus have someone with me who can help me understand what is being said and what information is given to me.  I do not always understand medical terminology that is why someone is always with me.
0.783300	I feel like I am well-prepared to obtain, process and understand health information. Nothing in particular prevents me from understanding information and I do not mind asking questions if necessary. I don't really need help in this area but am confident I could find someone to assist me if needed.
0.705600	I feel that I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to an average capacity. I don't necessarily know more about medical things than the average person, but I think that I have enough common sense and knowledgeable enough about other things that I can make informed and appropriate decisions regarding my health.
0.916700	I feel that I have complete control over the health and Medical services I need. I have a primary doctor that I see several times a year and I am completely comfortable asking him any questions I may have concerning my medical condition.
0.900000	I feel like I can adequately understand health information and necessary services. If I don't understand something I will ask questions.
0.888900	I feel as though I very much have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I understand a lot about my medical conditions and can read and understand information very well. 
0.916700	I think that I can comfortably ask all the questions that need to be asked and digest all the information presented to me. I think that it is easy enough to find the information you need online before talking to other medical health professionals.
0.705600	I think that I am able answer any and all questions but I know I need assistance in understanding some things mostly because I don't know the technical terms but I know what is being spoken about in common English.
0.427800	I know that I have the full capability to understand health information given to me by medical professionals, but I often don't take the time to process it, or ask questions so that I can gain the full understanding.
0.744400	I think i have somewhat of a decent grasp of what I need to do with the information I receive for the most part. However, there are times when I'm left puzzled by certain information and a doctor isn't always available to answer my questions.
0.766700	I feel capable of understanding information provided to me. Sometimes I don't feel comfortable asking questions depending on the doctor or provider. That makes me concerned about making a decision about my health. 
0.833300	I feel as though I have the capacity, or ability to deal with my basic health information, services, etc. I have been able to do so for most of my adult life, with minimal difficulty. Occasionally, I need a hand understanding something technical, etc, but by and large, I get by just fine. I feel that I have, and will continue to make appropriate decisions regarding my health and well-being.
0.744400	I feel that I am very literate and have an easy time understanding things so long as they are explained in terms that I am familiar with. What I mean by that is if you use the word contusion I am less likely to understand than if you use the word bruise.
0.800000	My sister in law is a BSN, so obtaining information when needed is fairly simple. However, I don't really like to get information from her for reasons I need not go into here. I'm the type of person that if something doesn't make sense, I'll ask questions. If I'm unable to ask directly, I'll do some researching on it to see if I can figure it out and then if I'm still not sure I'd ask her.
0.866700	I am a highly educated women who has a lot of knowledge when it comes to my health.  I know that if i dont ask questions that I will not learn everything that I need to know about my health and condition.
0.783300	I feel that I have the knowledge, vocabulary to understand basic health information. I might at times need some help with unfamiliar terms but basic stuff is not a problem.
0.838900	I feel I am capable of making correct decisions and understanding what is being told to me.  I also have no problems asking the doctor to elaborate or explain in simpler terms if I do have an issue. 
0.866700	I feel I do a good job asking for clarification on any points that I don't understand when it comes to basic health information. I try to make sure we cover all the bases and want to always do my best to provide a good informed decision when making a health decision. 
0.850000	I feel confident in getting information on most things at my healthcare providers location and over the phone. The biggest complaint that I have is with billing. My bills are never up to date (on their end) and so I never know what is going on.
0.844400	I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and services.  The challenge comes in when the doctors assume that all is understood and speak/move quickly.  Most of the time I am assertive enough to stop them and ask my questions, but at times I don't even think of the questions until I am out of the office or the doctor has already left the room.  Bedside manner isn't always top notch either. 
0.527800	If your goal is to get a degree without paying for it, itâs highly unlikely youâll be able to do that. However, online sources, schools without walls, and external degree programs are becoming increasingly common, and will only continue to increase in our digital world. Many colleges, even some of the best, offer online courses you can take for free, or, if you pay for them, you can get college credit for taking them. For instance, the University of Massachusetts (Amherst) has a University without Walls program that offers online courses and grants credit for experience. However, youâll need to pay for your credits. Even Harvard offers a number of free (non credential) and paid (credentialed) courses.
0.838900	I think for the most part i understand well.  Sometimes the medical jargon is confusing and sometimes prescriptions are contradicting, but all in all i understand well enough to know what i am being told. 
0.788900	I feel somewhat confident i have the capacity to obtain,  process and understand basic information and services with regards to making appropriate health decisions due to the access of information provided by internet and other media outlet.
0.872200	I feel I have a good understanding for the most part when it comes to health information and services. I try to ask questions although sometimes I am uncomfortable and do not ask my Dr. them. If I don't ask the Dr. I always go home and look up further information online. I always read the info that the pharmacist gives me and feel pretty competent. 
0.883300	I think I have the knowledge and ability to understand health information and services. I have an education in public health, which gives me the background information I need to make informed choices. I'm also comfortable asking questions.
0.816700	I think that I am smart enough to grasp most concepts and information I to obtain in regards to me health.  More importantly though I know when to ask questions and seek information I do not know.  That means asking a nurse or a doctor, or seeking the information on-pine. I am not afraid to ask if I do not know.
0.677800	I feel that most of the time i am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information by myself. But sometimes i need the help of a medical assistant to help me.
0.805600	I am fairly efficient at getting the information I need from a combination of asking questions and looking things up on the internet.  I will check definitions of words and terms if I am having trouble.  I am comfortable with most language and when I have trouble I have a good friend who is consistently able to help me. 
0.650000	i have the basic knowledge and quite experience about all the stuff listed in the previous questions because i visit hospital ocassionaly and for checkups and treatments
0.683300	I feel i need to ask around a little bit to really get the information, but it's usually very easy to obtain
0.888900	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.  I may forget to ask a question at the doctor's office but I'll do the research to figure out an answer.  I'll research online, ask a friend with a medical license or call my doctor's office.  
0.916700	I am smart aware person. I don't have any mental issues that keep me from understanding instructions given to me from a doctor or nurse or any medical professional. I feel like a competent person who can handle anything.
0.916700	I believe that I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding information regarding my health. I have a hearing loss and occasional difficulty understanding professionals with strong accents, but will make sure I have a thorough understanding before leaving the appointment. The internet is also a valuable tool and I have reached out to professionals by phone as needed. 
0.888900	I can understand as well or better than most people what medical conditions or treatments are described by doctors and nurses. I will ask any questions needed to clarify diagnoses, recommendations or treatment options. I have a pretty good understanding of how the human body works and what can go wrong. I do not need any help reading or remembering directions and instructions regarding medical care.
0.805600	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information and use this to make health decisions. However, I didn't always, and I feel as though the fact that I am constantly reading things online and that I work in the medical field (not clinically, in marketing though) helps me understand a lot of things in a better way.
0.711100	Sometimes medical vocabulary is quite technical and only familiar to those within the field. I usually will refer to the internet or family members that work in healthcare professions to clarify any doubts. I do not trust myself 100% to understand and make decisions based on my knowledge only.
0.655600	I often have troubles with the doctors information and procedure explanations. I understand about fifty percent of what they tell me. Often a nurse will help me understand. I also go on the internet for more information. 
0.827800	I understand as long as it's explained in layman's language. I tend to think of questions after it's too late to ask them.
0.833300	Since I come from an applied science background (engineering), I feel that I am pretty good at sorting through actual medical literature, research, etc. regarding conditions and their treatment. However, I'm much less confident dealing with the administrative side of medicine and health - finding the best providers, ensuring that all billing and payment go smoothly, etc.
0.883300	I am almost always capable of understanding health information, but when I am not, I quickly resort to my smartphone to research any and all information necessary. I will also be sure to write down any questions I may need to ask.
0.838900	I have very little medical knowledge, but I am able to understand and process what a doctor or nurse tells me as long as they take their time and define medical terms.  When I know I have a procedure coming up, I take a notepad with me to the doctor's office so I can write down the process I need to follow - such as blood testing, pre-admission testing and so forth.
0.644400	I feel like I understand most of the information that I get from doctors and nurses but sometimes I don't know exactly what they're talking about so I have to ask extra questions or ask them to help me. 
0.883300	Quite good. I'm quite interested in and pretty knowledgeable about science and health. Even if I'm not familiar with the specific topic, I can usually grasp new things quickly. The internet is a great resource, and I'll usually do a lot of research there. I'll ask the doctor questions when needed as well, but I've learned that doctors are not as well-versed in all aspects of health as some people may assume, and I always look beyond the doctor's opinion into scientific research and other resources.
0.694400	I have an okay understanding of the human body and the mechanics that happen within.  I know how to google things to help that understanding where it's vacant. This helps partially illuminate for me some health information that other people when exposed to it would be oblivious to.  However I'm no doctor or nurse and I struggle to really get to the bottom of things that ail me.  Additionally I don't know what's the appropriate questions or information to ask a doctor or tell a doctor to help them better diagnose any health problems.  Some times my terminology might off and there's misunderstandings from using the wrong terminology.  I really suffer from also not understanding all the specialists such as neurologist ( i know that one, but don't know most of the other ones).
0.916700	I feel totally confident in my capability to obtain ,process and understand basic health information.As someone who is highly educated, having obtained a Masters degree , though have never been in the labor force I do think I have the proficiency to the needful.
0.827800	Overall I would say that my capacity for understanding and processing basic health information is very good.  I find the reading material easy to understand, if I have questions I can usually ask the nurse or doctor at the time of my appointment.  I also can look online for questions regarding my condition.
0.822200	I think have the ability to access the information I need to make good decision about my health and the health of my family.
0.916700	I feel like I am capable of understanding and communicating with health professionals about my healthcare.  I also feel confident about making appropriate health decisions for myself.
0.761100	I can understand different health conditions by reading about causes, symptoms, and different treatments online.  If the doctor told me something about a condition I had I would do my own research on my time.  I understand the risks when taking prescription medication.  I have also filled out forms applying for health insurance and have filled out other official forms online.
0.794400	I feel that I am very well equipped to handle these basic health information and  services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I always take my time reading the information presented for me and ask the right questions. 
0.705600	I feel I'm easily able to amalgamate and coalesce basic health information, although I may not have the technical understanding of the information. I haven't had many hospital experience, but the ones I have had were pleasant apart from the circumstance.
0.827800	I have the capacity to get information but I don't necessarily know how to interpret it. I also don't know some medical terms.
0.777800	Most of the information that I receive from my doctor is directly explained to me without any problems. My doctor is very understanding that I may not understand MD's talk so she explains it to me more easier. I feel there isn't a problem and that I get all the information I need.
0.883300	I have trouble understanding technical jargon that some health professionals speak. When I do not understand I have the abilities to ask questions that result in the health professionals explaining these issues so I can understand. 
0.916700	I am absolutely confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I always ask my doctors all questions I feel I must ask in order to fully understand any information I was given during medical visits. 
0.661100	I think that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. This past year I have had to sign up for health care four times due to job changes and it really made me understand what I am getting and paying for. And how messed up our system really is. 
0.861100	The degree I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information is extremely well. Iâm a 2nd year medical student and have grown in knowledge as an upcoming physician. Of course I donât know everything, but when I myself need to go to the doctor Iâm not afraid to obtain information, understand it, and Iâm confused or have questions, my doctor is very well in explaining it. I sometimes consult with my family in important decisions, but other than that Iâm very good in making appropriate decisions when it comes to my health, and what is between me and my physician. 
0.455600	I don't feel as if I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information greatly. I constantly need help in understanding basic health information. 
0.833300	The problem is with the fact that the basic health information itself that is so dumbed-down it gets in the way of making appropriate decisions.  Health services are then rendered based off of the inadequate information.   There's never any mainstream knowledge given to the public to help them understand how to implement knowledge to help themselves from the ground up; a perfect example of this is with nascent iodine, which helps the thyroid which is the master gland of the body responsible for balancing all other organs.   Without nascent iodine, fluoride, intentionally put in drinking water overwhelms EVERYONE'S thyroid.  But from an allopathic perspective, 'if ain't broke and the test doesn't say so, don't fix it'.  The Rockefellers taking over medicine in the 1940's and helping create the modern version of allopathic medicine is disgusting!
0.661100	I am fairly confident that I have enough information, but there are times when the doctor uses terms that I don't understand.  During a hospitalization, there were many doctors talking quite a bit in medical terms I did not understand.  They would use acronyms and abbreviations which I had no idea what they were.  I had to have a cardiac catheterization and was pretty confused by the terms they were using.  
0.916700	Yes. I am confident in my ability to understand the information provided to me and then using that information in order to make healthy and well educated decisions. I also do follow up research myself, to verify any information given to me.
0.511100	I think I feel more comfortable if I have help from someone else when going over these things regarding the process of obtaining and carrying out various things concerning health care. I understand the basics and how they relate to me personally, but anything beyond that I usually ask my mother since she has dealt with these types of things for her entire life and she is very knowledgeable about them.
0.738900	I believe that I am perfectly capable of filling out documents or even asking the questions that I need. I typically write down things so I don't forget them, especially those that are important questions. My doctor is patient and provides answers in a thorough way. And if I don't quite understand things,  they will put it in less technical terms. Some things are easier to get than others.  If I still feel lost, I will Google terms. 
0.711100	I think I have the ability to process and understand basic health information given my background in chemistry and biology. For terms/concepts I don't understand, I tend to Google the information to learn about it. 
0.822200	I think that I would be able to retain as much information initially. If there was anything that seemed confusing I would then write it down for later so that I could research it myself to the best of my ability. However, before it would get to that point I would ask as many questions as I could.
0.855600	I feel like I am pretty good at obtaining and understanding health information. I have an English degree and teach high school reading, so I am more proficient at the English language than most people. When I do not understand something, I generally Google it to find the answer. I often know exactly what the doctor and/or nurses will tell me before I even go in because of my own research.
0.900000	I think I am very capable in this area.  I am not by any means a professional, but I do read a lot, and have seen many documentarys and educational materials about health related issues that I am quite comfortable with my ability to read and understand as much as I need to.
0.805600	i'm not senile. i just turned 56. now i know how old people feel. i think i'm able to get and understand health info as well as anyone 
0.900000	I always make sure I read any document medical or otherwise that requires my signature completely thoroughly. I read quite a bit in general, and do so at a practiced leisurely pace to ensure I process what I am reading. Medical information especially is extremely important to understand everything pertaining to what you're getting involved in the moment you step into a doctors office or hospital. Health decisions are some of the most important decisions we make in our lives, considering these decisions literally do directly effect our life and livelihood. I know there are a lot of people who don't tell their doctors enough information, and don't read enough into the pros and cons of medical decisions for many reasons, but I know that I'm not one of those people. I am still young and health is important at every age.
0.488900	I feel like I have a general knowledge of how to take care of myself, but I find doctor's visits awkward and tend to feel rushed and without time to ask questions or get explanations for what the doctor is doing.
0.811100	I feel that I am very capable of processing the information and making informed decisions.  However, I find that I often forget to ask pertinent questions that I later think of at home.  I may also do some more research at home and find that I have more questions.  There have also been times where my doctor was unable to provide me with a satisfactory answer to my questions.
0.777800	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information in a high degree, it's better when a doctor or nurse talks to me about the issue and tells me what should I do and medicines I should take, I rather to receive this information in a conversation, I can understand written prescriptions but not perfectly and sometimes I struggle with it.
0.883300	I feel very confident in my ability to communicate my symptoms and concerns to the doctor and then ask questions to clarify my understanding when they give a diagnosis.  I ask a LOT of questions and then I go home and do a little more research online.
0.916700	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information, and to obtain services if I do need help understanding what information is given to me.
0.688900	 I do not feel like I am adequately prepared to deal with a health issue. The facilities near me are very bad and most people I know refuse to go to them in anything short of an emergency. The one time I went they told me to drink some tea and use Nyquil. They charged me $350 for that information. I asked numerous questions and the doctor just didn't them and seemed more interested in getting me out of there. From that experience I took it upon myself to start researching  and learning what questions to ask and where to go that would provide adequate healthcare. The internet is great source of information and I feel I have benefited greatly from using it for answering some minor medical questions. 
0.722200	I feel fairly confident that I understand most basic health information. I don't always remember everything so I like to have things written down so there is no confusion.
0.883300	I believe I am pretty competent and intelligent and would be able to understand any basic health information I am given and any services I would need to have in the future.
0.872200	i work in healthcare so i understand lots of medical terms and procedures and what i do not know or understand i simply ask for clarification on. when it comes to my health i always make sure i am 100% sure of all the information needed to avoid any situations.
0.438900	I feel like I have a basic understanding of most medical terms, but some of the jargon remains opaque to me.
0.855600	I feel confident, but most likely because I haven't had to deal with any major health issues yet. I find that the internet is a very vast source of information, that can supplement a medical professional's advice in terms of what to do regarding treatment or diagnosis. I feel as though I have ample access, as well as everybody else living in the modern era, to access vast wells of knowledge whether it be via the internet, through word of mouth, or through the expansive network of medical institutions which seem to be always open. Even if you can't get an appointment right away, there seems to always be alternate options.
0.916700	I can read well, i can see well, i have enough intelligence and experience to know who to call for help and information if i need it. i have 100 degree confidence in my ability to call whoever needs to be called or asked a question if i need it.
0.800000	I feel that I am well informed about medical situations that I am in or my children are in. Often I will research information before going to the doctor so that I have an idea about what we will be discussing. Usually, if I am struggling to wrap my mind around what is going on I will ask questions until i fully understand so that I can care for myself or for my child in the best possible way.
0.827800	I feel I'm very capable of understanding documents in general because I read them frequently for work. Reading health documents is a little more complex but the basic idea is still the same. I can easily search online for credible information and get a variety of views on what is best for me.
0.833300	I definitely have a decent understanding of medical information that pertains to me when it's presented. Occasionally I'll need a little bit of help or extra information from the doctor, especially when it come to steps I have to take in order to control my condition.
0.772200	I feel that I have the overall capacity to obtain and process my health information but the emotional and time pressured environment of healthcare appointments impedes my ability to do so. For routine care it doesn't matter so much, but when there is a problem with your health or someone you love and you only have 15 minutes to discuss it things can get overwhelming and confused.
0.888900	I have full faith in my abilities to understand my health information and what services I require. I am of sound mind and judgement to take care of myself in these issues and any concerns regarding my own health.
0.900000	I feel I have a full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as I often do read all of my material from my provider. I also will ask questions if I am unsure of how to complete any forms. I also make sure to answer a health questions so that I have a better understanding with my health care provider. 
0.900000	I have a degree in Health Information Management. This has provided me with a thorough understanding of medical terminology and concepts. If i encounter something that i am not familiar with i at least have the capacity to find the answers i need.
0.766700	I feel like I've got a good degree of understanding but medical literature can be confusing and a lot of times I forget what I want to ask the doctor or I feel too nervous to ask him
0.688900	I am fortunate enough to have a father who was a paramedic, one brother who is a nurse anesthetist, another brother who is a physicians assistant, and a fiance who is attending medical school. I have opportunities to constantly get in contact, ask questions, and have multiple opinions on a single matter. This being said, I utilize this perk often, as many times I do not understand or get proper answers from medical professionals at offices, hospitals, and urgent care centers. There are times that I feel as though words are purposely being used to go over my head about things, to avoid detection of a unsure opinion. I don't normally have problems understanding material and pill descriptions, just on occasion, problems with the professionals themselves, and their explanations. 
0.850000	I think I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually write down questions I may have and the answers I'm given to make sure I have all the information I need.
0.916700	I feel I have a high degree in understanding these things myself. Ive had to make important medical choices by myself including surgery
0.900000	I feel like I can read and understand basic medical information.  I feel that I can do this on my own, without any assistance.  And, I believe that I understand what is told to me or give to me to read well enough to make my own medical decisions.
0.855600	I am quite capable to ask all of the needed questions regarding my condition while providing my doctor and nurse with the details necessary. So far , in my life, i have not had any incidents of not understanding something.
0.900000	I'm young enough, reasonably smart, and have an internet connection so, yes, I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.
0.883300	Because of my own ability to research and my ability to tap the wisdom of others in my personal life, I feel confident about my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. 
0.805600	I feel that I am completely able to read and understand basic, moderate, and even challenging health information. I can say that I am not good at asking questions or probing further for fear of wasting time. But, I have never had an issue with the explanations or information given me. I also have no problem understanding or filling out medical forms. I have the awareness and knowledge to make health decisions regarding myself that I understand and am comfortable with. In fact, I don't find most health forms, diagnosises, or health information that complex actually. So, to answer the question I am completely comfortable in this regard. 
0.916700	I feel that I'm very good at understanding basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. Anytime I'm confused or don't understand fully I ask questions and doo research.
0.916700	My mind is sound and I have a B.A. degree in English (literature), so I can easily read and understand medical instructions and information about health services. If I need to know more about a health condition, I ask my doctor or nurse, and research the topic online.
0.805600	Most of the time I get enough information to make informed decisions regarding mine or my loved ones care. I feel that I'm at a good level of understanding. 
0.872200	I am quite confident that I have the ability to understand medical information provided to me. I am able to easily process and understand basic health services without any issues. 
0.677800	I'm somewhat good at get the information i need to make a right or appropriate decision .i used the internet and my family doctor when something arise and try to understand the possible course or  treatment and to know which is best suited for my need and necessity and i seek help from my family member that have medical experience 
0.777800	I feel that i have a basic understanding of medical knowledge. A lot of times I will need help understanding things regarding medical terms if it's something that I'm really unfamiliar with. It can be hard remembering all the information they throw at you at once so sometimes I like to have another person there with me to help out with that.
0.827800	I think I understand everything doctors or nurses tell me about my health. If I don't I usually ask lots of questions until I understand. Understanding the information about my (or my son's and husband's) health is very important to me
0.766700	I think that for the most part, I can get the information process it pretty well. If I do not understand something though, I always ask questions, either to the doctor or the nursing staff because that is why they are. They are there to answer things that you may not be completely sure of. When they start using the medical names for conditions or treatments, I start to be lost, until they break it down for me to understand.
0.900000	I am confident that I have the capacity to understand health information that is shared with me, and the ability to make appropriate decisions based on that information.
0.666700	I believe i have 100% capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because i have a voice and during my appointment with my doctor i can ask the questions that concern me the most. There's always someone,either family or hospital staff who could help me make the most appropriate health decision.
0.750000	I feel like I have a good understanding of basic health, I'm also not afraid to ask stupid questions or ask a question more than once or ask it a different way so that I understand what I am hearing. My mother in law is also a nurse so if I don't understand something she can usually break it down into something i understand.
0.722200	I feel that for the most part I feel that I have the capacity to do all these things. If I have any questions, I can call my doctor's office and speak to a nurse to explain things. I could google any questions I had (regarding things like filling out forms). I could also ask my parents, who have much more experience as far as health services go.
0.872200	I think I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Although I sometimes don't understand things, for instance what the difference is between a new medication and the one I'm stopping, when I ask for clarification I can generally understand the answers given to me. I feel that I am capable of using this information to make appropriate decisions regarding my healthcare.
0.644400	Yes, If I don't understand I ask as many questions as needed till I do understand. I am very concerned about my health.
0.800000	I think I often don't even know the questions I need to ask and so that is why I feel like I miss out on knowing everything.
0.738900	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain and understand and process most basic heath and serviced in order to make decisions. I do have a background helping out in a doctors office for a very short time so this probably does help my understanding a good bit. I usually have doctors that inform me very well and explain stuff even when I do not need it explained. 
0.855600	I think that I am pretty on par in terms of being able to understand, obtain, and process basic health information. I am intelligent and often know what to ask to get the information needed so that I understand what is going on.
0.838900	I don't have extensive knowledge of the medical feild and services, but I do think I enough of the basic knowledge to make good decisions in regards to my health.  I do know that if it is something I know nothing about,  I am not afraid to ask for assistance from people who I know are much more knowledgeable.  I also will do any research I  can to obtain a better grasp of the situation.  
0.561100	While I am mostly able to understand the information given to me, I often hesitate to ask for clarification or to bring up questions that I wish to ask but that don't seem immediately relevant. I have some trouble filling out forms. I think my capacity to understand basic health information is good, but it could be better. 
0.811100	I feel like I can get the info from the Doctor. If I have any further questions, I'll ask health professionals I know, call my Dr. back,  and/or do additional research online. 
0.916700	I feel that I have a great understanding of medical terminology. I have worked in the medical field, as a secretary and now a billing coordinator,  for many years. I have a clear understanding and health information and the services that are needed to make appropriate health related decisions.
0.844400	I can see and read perfectly fine. I don't like it when the Dr. doesn't give you time to respond to any concern that have arisen while he is talking to you. I almost always feel rushed. And uncertain what was even said. I have had so many come in and start going on about what needs to happen or what is going on right away. They don't give you time to process anything. You might have a question early on and the not hear anything said after that. Or else completely forget the question you had trying to comprehend what is being said. 
0.861100	I feel like I have a capacity to understand what information I am given when it comes to my health. If I do not understand, I know who to ask to help me to understand the information.
0.888900	I am able to understand the majority of medical information and to get help if I should need it. I always know what services are available to me.
0.916700	I have worked in the healthcare field in the past as an Ultrasound technician,  and therefore feel I have a basic understanding of healthcare in general.  Being able to understand a lot of the terms and being able to communicate with doctors is a big help for me.

The only thing that I really do not like is that I feel that the doctors are always in a rush and by the time you have a question they have already left. This is not personal it is because of the healthcare system is about the money as well.

0.811100	I really don't have much of a difficulty understanding health information.  I work as a medical technologist at a primary care hospital and since I don't know everything about health I have people around me like doctors nurses and other health professionals that can help me understand what I don't.
0.827800	I have the general capacity to do so. But there are mitigating factors.

0.766700	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand most of the time. Some times I don't get the answer I was looking for or expecting. I do make sure to insist and get the best answer from the doctor. On occasions the doctor comes in and out and does not allow time for asking the questions I want.
0.838900	i always make sure to ask any questions I have with my doctors and nurse, even if they sound stupid.  Often times though, I will think of questions I need answered long after I've already left my doctor's visit and I have to go online and research what little I can but still be unsure of decisions.
0.800000	I'm for the most part somewhat aware of my health so when it comes to health and filling out forms most of the time I don't need help because I've been on top of my health and know what I need to ask and to add in a form when visiting the doctor. 
0.588900	I feel I have a capacity to learn the information ,but it is difficult due to the wording , and the way the medical information is presented. If I had better resources and someone to  explain some of the working I feel I would have not problems finding out that information

I also have access to the Internet to do research on anything that I am uncertain about. I fill out my own medical forms and help others fill out their medical forms. Family members often ask me for assistance when it comes to understanding forms or information provided by their doctors and other health professionals. If I have any questions, I know who to ask for help, or where to do my own research for clarification. 
0.866700	I feel that all the information is available.  Most important is to be completely honest with the doctor and do proper research.  Googling an answer is not the best way to get information.  Proper research into peer reviewed papers from the top of each prospective field is necessary.  This is not to discount the information that is obtainable by each doctor.  These professionals know more about your individual circumstances than anyone.  It is important to ask for and get information from many different resources.

But, again if there is any confusion i just ask for it to be clarified.  Now, at the pharmacy, i don't always ask all the questions that i should. I usually refer any questions about medication back to my doctor/nurse. 
0.850000	In terms of my own ability, I do have pretty easy access to my doctor and obtaining help that does not require me to go into the office or schedule an appointment. As long as the question isn't complicated or require that physical presence. My mother is also a nurse so that really helps a lot if I do not have access to my doctor at the time. 
0.900000	I feel like I have enough knowledge to understand my health information and if there's ever something I don't understand I know what to do in order to obtain the information I need.  If I don't understand something I can always go to a relative or search online for more answers.
0.416700	I am not a good patient. I need help from my brother and mother when I get handed or told anything. They have to be the ones to tell me everything and my next steps to do. 
0.850000	I usually feel like I can get the information I need, but I oiften worry that I don't have the expertise to understand all of it and get all the answers to questions I need. I'm not sure all of the time, and worry I won't know how to handle a condition - even though I really don't have anything wrong at this point in my life.
0.916700	I feel 100% capable of finding and understanding the health care information that I need, and in consultation with my doctor making the decisions that are best for me.

0.650000	I believe I have the capacity to understand some of the basics about health care.  The doctors and nurses do not take enough time, though to fully answer questions.  I feel like I'm on an assembly line when I go to the docs\ter.
0.761100	I feel I have a reasonable ability to make basic health decisions. I feel as though I understand most of what I'm told by my doctor or can ask for help if I don't understand. That said, sometimes it is embarrassing to admit what I don't know, so I might use Google to get the information I need instead of asking the doctor.
0.311100	I have physical impairments that stem from a car accident that prevent me from doing specific things. The disability or impairment has had a severe effect on memory and I am often times unable to remember what I was doing or going to do just moments ago. I can process the information, but I need someone there with me because I will forget what I read within the next 30 minutes. I will remember that I read something, but have a vague idea of what it was that I read .
0.883300	I try to be as open and honest with my health care provider as I can. When I visit the health care provider I accept the fact that in the end they are the expert in the field. I may have some limited knowledge and will give what little I know and ask questions based on that. However, I look to them as the person who can best understand and explain things. It is their field of expertise and seek them for their knowledge and help.
0.750000	I think I can understand most of what I am told.  If not I will ask for a clearer explanation and if I don't get it I will look it up and try to find out more about it.
0.733300	"I know that my doctor and every other healthcare provider I encounter are motivated by money and pressure from insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. Often I want to ask my doctor things like, ""how much would you profit if I do this procedure you are suggesting?"" Or, ""did a sales rep promise you a trip to a conference in a vacation destination if you prescribe this drug?"" But, blunt questioning about conflicts of interest is likely to antagonize a doctor and his guilty conscience, so I stay quiet. "

0.777800	I feel like I am very capable of understanding any health information that providers give to me. However, my recent experience has been that providers may give you conflicting information and may be highly unavailable to answer questions and communicate poorly in general. For example, my husband has high blood pressure and his old PCP said to try to reduce salt, while his neurologist said that salt intake doesn't matter. In our community, we have facilities run by Banner, and our experiences has been that these doctors have poor communication and don't feel bothered to answer questions or return phone calls. 
0.883300	I am very capable of receiving, giving and understanding information to and from my medical practitioners and facilities. The information can be overwhelming if you have something major going on so it's always good to have someone you can count on to help if there is an emergent situation.
0.872200	I feel I have an average degree of knowledge about obtaining and understanding health information needed for myself and family members. I believe my family doctor will provide me with information and would be able to help me understand anything that I did not. Also doing my own research on the internet or could provide information and explanations. 
0.822200	I feel like I'm capable of handling tasks at hand when I need too. If I need to ask questions I will, and if I do not understand I will speak up. But I'm sure I can understand them regardless.
0.733300	Oddly, my father is in the hospital this very week with kidney failure and pneumonia and I had to provide end of life, resuscitation information and fill out a great deal of forms in the past 7 days. My mother is a nurse and I've grown up around health care professionals so I have a lot of personal resources I can draw on if I have questions, I also feel I'm fairly intelligent and can do my homework on the internet to ask relevant questions and look  up issues and procedures after I talk to a health care professional to be fully informed. 
0.883300	For the most part I've had no problem understanding anything involved with going to see a doctor, but I have had to ask for help to understand health insurance.
0.900000	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  Working in health care in the past has helped me understand better, but if there is something I don't understand I ask the doctor to clarify for me until I do understand it.
0.761100	I often obtain the information I need to understand and maintain my health in such a condition, that I am not a nuisance to myself and my loved ones. Sometimes healthcare providers resist. They don't have time for me, they have too many patients, they don't care, etc. That's a sign for me to find a better healthcare provider.
0.794400	I am currently a college student and decently educated in biology and chemistry, along with anthropology. While none of these things alone would help me very much, the combination of them I feel gives me a pretty good understanding of basic medical information. I can usually understand what a condition or illness is doing, or why, at its core. 
0.883300	I feel pretty confident in my ability to read and understand basic and even slightly complex medical and health information and services in order to make good health decisions.  I'm not an MD, but I do have a bachelor of science and I have studied and taken classes on health and medical issues, so the extent to which I understand a lot of the scientific terminology and complex issues is usually pretty good.  If I don't understand something, I will ask, but generally my doctor or health provider is able to answer my question in such a way that I can understand afterwords.
0.900000	I think I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

0.833300	I believe that I have a good understanding of the medical field as my wife is a nurse and I also have a background in IT.  Since the body tends to work like a computer and much of the same logic can be applied in different ways, I believe that I am a person who can understand how different parts of the body may interact with each other.  Also, taking the time to understand the body, which is our survival tool is very important and everyone should have a basic understanding of certain medical terms and logic.
0.900000	I feel I have a decent grasp on what questions I should ask my doctor when I'm going in for a physical. If I have any questions I will sometimes do some research online before going in to get an idea of what others have had questions about so that I can make certain I don't miss anything. 
0.866700	I definitely think I have the capacity and the confidence to ask questions when necessary. I make all of my own health decisions, so it's important to be well-informed.
0.705600	I feel like I obtain most basic health information but it is very hard to process and understand the information. I feel like I already make appropriate health decisions, but when a doctor sits down and tries to tell me what is wrong with me and what I should do about it it can sometimes get very confusing. I have never understood why doctors use technical terms with regular people because a regular person has no idea what the doctor is saying half of the time. If a doctor were to sit down with me and slowly explain what is going on in regular, every day terms, I would might understand better what is wrong with me whenever I go to the doctors office.
0.900000	I feel I have the full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can under my doctor, ask the questions I need answered, and take the action necessary.
0.422200	Well recently I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and my doctor just gave me a pamphlet. I was not sure what to ask or what the next steps were and it was not explained to me either.   I felt like this was pretty serious and me having no knowledge of it should have been explained in detail but it was not. I would have to say i would really have to experience in obtaining information when it comes to my basic health information or what exactly i should be doing. I would rather hear it from a doctor then to have to google what i should be doing. 
0.600000	usually when i have a health problem and visit a doctor, I give all the symtoms to the doctor and try to explain them as detailed as possible and ask all the doubts i have without any hesitation and when any form is to be filled out I usually need a help as i dont understand all the things asked for and complete the form.

0.688900	I feel like I am constantly having to look up information about my medical health on my own, like on Google, and I'm having to make sense of it all on my own. Also, many times doctors seem like they don't know, until I search it and tell them about it and then they look into. This is so stressful for me.

0.800000	"I'm a very patient and curious person, so even if I encounter something I don't understand, I will do what I can in order to understand it, given enough time. I may not be the smartest person around, but I often make up for that with persistence. I'd consider all but the most complicated of topics within my reach (and those complicated topics out of reach simply due to not having the resources available to me to study them farther). Since the question here is in regard to ""basic health information"", I feel confident in my ability to come to a solid understanding, if needed."
0.816700	If I am given a document to read, I can understand most of not all of it, and if I have any questions regarding the document, I am able to ask the doctor or an employee about it. Sometimes if I am asked an open-ended question (for example, if everything has been okay since my last visit), I tend to err on the side of not mentioning what I consider small or irrelevant problems. Overall though, I feel confident about my ability to get the information and services needed to make decisions about my health.
0.811100	I went to a new primary doctor recently and I felt rushed. I told him a few of the health issues I was concerned with but not everything. I did get a referral for one health problem but I feel I have to make more appointments to address more problems.

0.633300	I typically understand what they are telling me, but I find that my biggest problem is remembering it all.

0.833300	I feel like most information is readily available to those who know where to look, or know whom to ask questions to. Google is a great tool. Taking notes or receiving a pamphlet about what is medically going on, you can go home and do proper research. When I'm in the moment of receiving a lot of information, I process what I can and tend to wait till later to ask questions. The more often you receive that medical information, the more likely you're going to understand it subsequently. 
0.627800	Given my ability to obtain process and understand medical information regarding my conditions, I would say that I have a good level of understanding, although with more complex heath issues I need a better explanation, that is usually given by a medical professional. Thankfully once something is told to me I have a good grasp of how it works and what I can do to.

0.705600	I feel like sometimes the pamphlets and print outs are way too much information and it's so much to read. I'd rather have the cliff notes. Sometimes I worry about giving too much or too little information while talking to the nurse or the doctor. Or I forget things and then I remember after the fact. Sometimes I think doctors are in a rush and they also dont always take the time to explain things to you in an easy to understand manner. Or they don't give you enough options or time to decide on options.

All in all, I like making sure I'm well aware of any condition or illnesses.

I forget some health issues from the past, After a visit I need time to rethink everything again and to talk to the doctor but nobody has that time, I read a lot of health articled and follow famous health blogger, knowing some information I feel confused because sometimes I see conflict between the information I know and the doctor's opinion. I would like everything to be consistent and logically understandable but it is not. In some of the cases doctors are working with old knowledge, and they do not make connection between the health problems and prefer to focus on one instead of the total picture.
0.916700	I can completely understand information pertaining to my medical conditions. I also make sure to bring my spouse to any important appointments so that we both hear the information and so he can ask questions if I don't think of one.

If I know it's information I really need 100 percent understanding on I will most definitely ask the doctor until I comprehend what is asked of me.

Occasionally, I find things confusing and I try to get an explanation from the doctor or nurses. However, they sometimes have a difficult time explaining medical terminology in terms that average people can understand. If I am unable to get the answers I need, I often rely on the internet to clear up confusion. Unfortunately, the internet does not always have the correct information about certain health issues and this can cause more issues in the long run. That is why I always try to get good information from the source, like the doctors or nurses themselves.

0.655600	I'm the type of person that if I not understand something that they are telling to me or something that I read over and over again and I no understand I ask until I'm capable of help myself or help others. I prefer to ask I have the knowledge and help that don't ask and make a mistake.
0.572200	I am capable of understanding what the doctor is telling me, if they are giving me basic information about my health.  But when I suffered from a serious condition almost dying and having stayed in the hospital for a month, to this day they never clearly explained why I had the emergency.   I keep having to take test after test that makes no sense to me but they never clearly explain the problem.  I guess they just don't have an answer.  
0.722200	I don't think I'm that great at it.  I typically search stuff on the internet and get myself overly worried about it.

Several different doctors have told me different things, so I'm not sure what is right, and what is wrong.
0.772200	I think every time you try to obtain medical information in a clear and understandable manner, it is a challenge. I ask a lot of questions, but I seldom get the straight answers I desire and feel I deserve.

I have love ones to help me also and there always is the internet as the last resort.
0.688900	Usually if the doctors use big word terms for things, its difficult to understand. But explaining it or using different terms can help my understanding of things and I'm able to figure out what is happening to me.

When I'm anxious, no matter how intelligent I am normally it's hard to comprehend the forms and information given to me.  I need time to calm down and process things.  I often feel frustrated with understanding forms when I'm in the frame of mind.  When I'm presented with new health information, I need time to process and research to know what questions to ask.  At the time, I feel too agreeable because I'm just trying to get the appointment over with and the doctor is in a hurry.
0.900000	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. If at any time I am unsure of the information I have been given I am lucky enough to have been going to the same medical professionals for several years now and am confident enough with them to ask any questions I need to ask for clarification. I also grew up with a mom in the medical profession and have a basic understanding of the health problems I specifically have and/or may face.
0.722200	I believe I understand most of what I am told. I used to work in healthcare for over a year. I went to college for medical billing and coding so I know most of the medical terminology.

Not only have  worked in a hospital, my mother was a nurse and we used to look at her books. From that exposure I have a reasonably good grasp on medical terminology. I have more difficulty in following verbal instruction, especially if the person giving them does not do it well.
0.883300	I have an advanced degree in Library Science and am very well able to find, read and understand basic and advanced health information.
0.705600	I believe that I'm maybe average in terms of this type of basic health information processing, and how to understand it in order to make informed health decisions.

Its important to me to make the best decisions so I try to get information from different sources.
0.588900	I feel like I can understand the basic layman language the doctors and nurses tell me about health conditions, but I do not understand the background and the why as often. I just do what they tell me to do, regardless of understanding, and hope for the best.

0.777800	From the age of six, when my father carried me into an Arkansas emergency room, I have been intrigued with medicine.

0.916700	I feel that I have an advantage over most people's understanding of basic health information because I am a registered nurse.
0.650000	I do not have a full understanding of health information, especially since I am not in charge of insurance and live over 50 miles away from the nearest medical center.

0.755600	I feel like I can understand my doctor or nurse most of the time. However, there have been several occasions when my doctor tried to explain something to me that was over my understanding, or he simply didn't care to try and explain it in a way I could understand. Sometimes I leave with more questions than when I came in. My doctors tend to rush out of the room and I feel like they already have one foot out the door when they speak with me.
0.794400	I feel that I have a fair understanding of medical terminology in regards to my own health and medical needs.

0.644400	I guess that I have a very basic understanding of the human body and medical procedures.  The only health class I have taken was back in high school so I don't remember to much of it.  I have to ask a lot of questions at the doctors office because I don't understand a lot of the terminology.  Medicine has always been a mystery to me and I feel out of my element when I'm expected to grasp it. Prescription drugs make me nervous because there are so many side effects and sometimes I don't understand all the jargon on the information sheet so I have to ask the pharmacist.
0.677800	Before I go to the Doctors office or Hospital, I research all of my symptoms to see if I can figure it out myself. If it is something that I can not determine I will go to the doctors office or emergency room for the proper attention of the matter. While I am in the appropriate place, if I do not know what is going on, I will ask questions to understand what is going on, so I can make the best decision for  myself.

After going home, if I have any follow-up questions, I will call to get assistance.

I have also helped my mother with many inpatient and out patient appoinments concerning her mental health. I also have three children who have had a variety of childhood illnesses and injuries.

I do think my life experience has helped with this comfort level with those in the medical field.

I have a pretty good 'know-how' when it comes to making appropriate health decisions.
0.794400	I feel very confident that I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. I like reading all the material that is given to me at the Dr. Office and usually write down my questions before going but sometimes I do forget and find google to be very helpful. I find most of the time the nurse and dr both explain everything at least 3 or more times. After having Kids and going to the Dr a lot you learn the process very quickly and it's usually the same every time.
0.588900	I feel like I can understand basic health information. But when it gets more complicated, I start to get confused. I feel like doctors rush through and don't tell you things thoroughly.

So I would say that I take the reigns in making sure my healthcare needs are taken care of  
0.777800	If it came to a serious decision I could definitely ask questions to make a determination.  I understand basics of what doctors are saying and mostly I just wait for results from tests in order to determine what more information I need.

0.672200	I feel like for the most part I can obtain health information I need by asking the doctor for documents, pamphlets and other hand outs.

0.872200	I believe that I can understand almost all of the information I'm told. I would ask questions if I didn't know. If I ever had another question I would look online and see if it is similar. If it is wild I would call my doctor to confirm the information.
0.566700	I think I am able to understand basic health information but I sometimes get overwhelmed and find myself unable to fully process information. It is helpful for me to have someone with me to rephrase what is being told to me.

0.883300	I feel confident in getting needed information and queries from health care providers. Even the worst healthcare professional would have more knowledge than the average layperson.

The combination of reputable information sources will often answer any questions and clear any anxieties.

I think I may not be the best at processing orally and then you factor in the vocab/lingo, and stress of being there and when I leave I feel I really am at a loss to discuss indetail what is going on. I get the gist but not the details and tha stresses me out. I have BA and I still striggle with the forms.

0.533300	That is really difficult to say, but I dont feel I, myself have those abilities to make those decisions by myself because one wrong decision or choice and I could be paying for the rest of my life. It is really very serious and I need to be precise when choosing. I feel I have average skills to read and understand and dont feel thats strong enough to make tough decisions as this on my own. I really have made this mistakes in the past regarding my healthcare and I spent thousands of dollars trying to make right on it.

0.688900	I think I only know the basic stuff that every average citizen knows.  I'm not a medical professional and I don't know much research my conditions or anything I have problems with.  However, with enough time and dedication, I'm sure I can look over information to get an understanding of some basic health information to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.727800	In general, I believe that I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.
0.827800	I believe I have all the necessary information I need to process and understand. I don't believe that doctors or nurses have enough time for me. I often avoid going to the doctor because I feel I am bothering the doctor with my problems.
0.827800	I feel like I am pretty well equipped to get and understand the information I need about my conditions to make health decisions.  Though sometimes lack of knowledge on part of health professionals makes it more difficult to get all available services.
0.861100	Medicine has always been an interest of mine, so I have no difficulty reading detailed medical reports or understanding the significance of the numbers associated with blood and other test results. If I do not know a term, I look it up.
0.900000	As an individual interested in my own health and wellbeing, I have the desire as well as the ability to obtain, understand and process basic health information. In addition, I have friends in the medical profession who would help me to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.600000	I believe that I can somewhat understand what Doctors tell me but I still prefer for them to write it down.  Often times, when a Dr originally tells me something I struggle to understand but after asking them to repeat I often understand it better. The internet has been a large help in allowing me to understand medical information.
0.916700	I feel completely confident that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. If there is anything I don't understand, I always ask questions, and if that doesn't work I take it upon  myself to research what I need to to make sure I understand everything. I understand what I need, recognize things I don't understand, and know how to find answers to any questions I might have.
0.655600	I believe that a lot of the terminology used can sometimes be difficult to comprehend. What makes it worse, is that I can be shy and don't ask the proper questions.
0.566700	I have at least some ability to. Sometimes I have trouble processing what's told to me if it's too much to handle at once. It feels like I'm just being bombarded with info and my brain shuts itself off to protect itself. 
0.711100	"In the past I've had difficulty getting the information I need because the nurse or doctor just seemed too busy to care. I felt like a burden or just another $$$ to them. They barely checked me out, barely heard what I was saying, disregarded it because ""they know best"", and sent me on my way. Recently I've gotten another health care provider who are a lot better and seem to genuinely care about their patients. Yes, like many places they still feel rushed and busy but they try their best to help as best as possible and even if they can't address the concerns at the time of the appointment encourage their patients to call or reach out to them through the online messaging system. Previously I felt too burdening or even afraid to voice my questions and concerns, but now I feel welcomed and even encouraged. They want to make sure I'm fully aware of everything and they want to know everything so they can provide the best treatment. I feel like I'm both informed and have the ability to get the information and understanding I need. We're a team in this."
0.916700	I feel I am absolutely qualified to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I feel I have a really high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services that I need to make appropriate health decisions.

0.811100	i think i have a high degree to obtain this type of information.  I don't read everything i'm given (for example i don't read every single possible side effect of every medication, because that would take too long), but i am almost always able to obtain, process and understand the information and on the rare occasion i don't understand it, i know who to contact.
0.827800	I am fairly confident in the information I receive from them and always ask for handouts. Sometimes I feel the Dr is not listening to what is being said as they are rushed for time and are not as detailed as they should be. 
0.838900	I'm usually comfortable going to the doctor's office and usually I understand what is being said. But If I ended up getting a difficult diagnosis I would want someone other than myself to be there, to listen and understand what the health professional is saying because I would feel re assured on what was taking place.
0.883300	In matters of my health I will take the time to carefully absorb the information I am given to evaluate my situation. I will research any additional questions I may have and will utilize all people I have available to me that have a understanding of my situation.
0.722200	I feel that I've had enough services performed within the healthcare system that I understand a good deal of what information I'm given. I also feel empowered to ask pertinent questions where my knowledge and understanding fails me.
0.538900	I feel like there is certain jargon used to confused patients when it comes to medical practices because i usually don't understand what doctors tell me and feel very disadvantaging. I feel like i have limited capacity to understand basic health information because i not educated on the material they are telling me. Also, doctors do a poor job helping me figure out what it is exactly that is wrong with me and i'm scared i'm being treated as some test that they had to pass on an exam; not tailoring their expertise to my specific needs.
0.883300	I feel like I have a firm grasp on how to access and understand basic health information as needed. My medical services have made both accessing and understanding health conditions incredibly easy with the use of phone apps and websites, as well as timely discussion through these mentioned means. 
0.900000	I am educated and well-read. I have been reading about medical and health-related information from a young age. My mom is a retired RN and I learned a lot from her growing up. I oversee my elderly parents' medical care, requiring me to stay relatively current on a multitude of medical specialties. 
0.777800	I feel like I have a high degree of understanding of medical issues and what my Doctors are telling me. I am also not afraid to ask questions, if I don't understand or only partially understand. I like to take a piece of paper with questions written down with me to my apt if i have things i am curious about or don't understand. And when a doctor is telling me something I will stop them if I don't understand something. I'm not a doctor so I don't have to understand things, thats why i have a doctor and why it's important to ask questions when they are explaining things!
0.916700	I have a graduate degree. Although I have never had any medical training, I am familiar with the meanings of many medical terms. I have also studied Latin, and learned the Latin derivation of many terms. I once volunteered in a medical clinic, and learned terminology from a doctor there. He encourage me to go to medical school.
0.805600	I have a lot of trust in my doctors and will ask them to explain anything I don't understand.

0.833300	I feel confident when i interact with the medical service providers like doctors and nurses  and ask them to clarify if anything is complex to understand,  in some instances I may need some help if i am filling up or reading the content related to medical condition 
0.805600	The one thing I feel I don't have is an advisory function from the doctor.  They are really good at recommending a TON of tests and a million other things, but they rarely tell you how much that is going to cost, which is all out of pocket these days any way, and if it's really needed at all.
0.755600	I feel as though I am adequately empowered to make my own decisions when it comes to my health. In several instances, however, I have been complacent with what my doctors suggest despite not fully understanding my diagnosis.
0.900000	I feel completely in control of my health decisions.   I can read all the documents, fill out my forms and I ask questions as necessary. 
0.872200	I feel that while I may not know the right questions to ask in a medical situation, I have the capability and knowledge to get the information I need to make health decisions.

0.683300	I believe I have the capacity to understand basic health information.  If I have basic health issues I am fine with understanding the risks and treatments.

I think that I can make decent informed decisions on healthcare needs and services.  
0.883300	I feel that I am in a stable state of mind and am physically sound enough to deal with any condition I face. And as such I will be able to fully grasp and understand from my doctor what needs to be done of me to deal with the condition and fix it.
0.916700	I am a bookworm who loves to read, I've been like this ever since I was a child. Therefore, reading and comprehending information, medical included, is not a problem for me.
0.700000	I feel that my abilities are more or less on par with the majority of the population. If I am given the tools and a rough idea of how they are used I feel I would have the capacity to navigate them. I would know where to find them or at the least who to ask to find out where to obtain them. I would have no issues processing or understanding them unless they used a lot of jargon. If they information was relevant it would likely help me make a health related choice.
0.822200	I believe that i possess the capability to understand basic health information to a high level of degree which helps me make andecision as to what is going to be the best decision regarding what action i should or should not take for my health benefit.

0.583300	I have a problem with it cause i got my disease at 12 and my mom always helped me with my medical conditions so i have a hard time expressing things with doctors. So i am trying to get better on making my own decisions 
0.672200	I feel like I am experienced enough to understand things.Also I have a history working in the Medical field and I feel like it can be helpful to me in my personal situation.
0.427800	I do not feel like I have a strong ability to understand medical health information that is to be provided to me. I always find myself getting help from someone. I do not want the chance of misinterpreting something. I take it very seriously when it comes to money and health.
0.816700	I feel fully capable of taking charge of my own health and that the current system gives me, as a native speaker and well-educated person, what I need
0.511100	I feel like I can understand if the Doctors / nurses take the time to explain it.  If they don't I look things up on the internet.  It can become confusing because there is so much information available online.  It is hard to get the Doctor to spend more than a few minutes with you.
0.750000	I feel like I have a lot of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

That being said, I find that I tend to get very emotional about health concerns during doctors' visits such that I don't think clearly.

Once I'm at home and I become calm, I find that I can think about and articulate questions regarding the health information and services necessary.
0.888900	When I go to the doctor, I prepare for what I want to know about whatever it is that I am experiencing.  I write down symptoms having, blood pressure taken at home, and any questions I have.

0.638900	I have a good understanding of my past medical procedures, allergies and current conditions.  I can convey this on the new patient or similar forms so the doctor can get my background.  I try to ask questions of the doctor when he comes up with a recommended treatment plan.  I use email correspondence with my doctor to follow up on any tests or labs. I primarily use Kaiser for my health care which stores all my medical records for easy access to any doctor. In fact, I recently moved to CO from CA, and the new Kaiser physician was able to transfer all my records locally. For prescriptions, I try to read about all the side effects and watch for them.

Allows for a more detailed discussion.
0.866700	I believe that I am knowledgeable enough to understand what my doctor or nurse is telling me as well as reading the materials they give to me.

If I don't understand something my doctor said I always ask questions to make sure I understand.
0.861100	I am a former hospital RN. I left the field more than 30 years ago so I'm out of touch but I have enough training to know how to do research. What I don't have is the confidence to speak with doctors about what's bothering me, mainly because none of the ones I've seen so far have been interested, plus I always get the feeling that I'm taking up time that they don't have much of. It's very frustrating.
0.761100	I feel I am able to understand basic health information enough to make appropriate decisions. I feel this way because I have several chronic medical conditions and have had to fill out many medical forms in the past. I have more doctor appointments then the average person.

So, I may need to get advice from the doctor or someone around me to help me understand, exactly what the papers are saying.
0.783300	I feel I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information to make my health decisions. When I do have difficulty, I have no problem asking for assistance from my family members or even my doctor.

0.622200	I have the capacity to understand basic health information because I did not leave the doctor without explaining to me everything.  Asking is learning.  There are words that I can't understand that's why I always ask the doctor what it is just to clarify everything.
0.655600	I think it takes some common sense to read it.  It might seem difficult to understand at first,  with the exceptions of a few big words, it is relatively easy.

0.822200	I feel like I have a good ability to understand and process basic health decisions as I work in a scientific field. 
0.805600	I feel like I understand and comprehend more than many people do regarding my health information, as I am an active participant in my own health care.  I also have had several medical conditions so I am well-versed in many medical issues.  However, at the same time, medical things are very confusing and there are often times things I do not understand that doctors explain to me.  I often have my husband present with me for a second set of ears so we can both discuss our understanding afterwards.

0.916700	I believe I can fully process and understand basic health information, needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never encountered a difficulty when filling out paperwork, or being given information. I find mostly everything to be straightforward and easy to understand. If I do not fully comprehend something, or have further questions, I have found my doctor, nurses, office staff and pharmacy staff always able and willing to help to the best of their ability. If for some reason I still have questions or would like something explained from another party, I can call my health insurances patient hotline.

0.738900	As far as basic information, I think I can do OK.  I don't currently have any medical conditions and have not had any serious ones so far.

0.705600	I feel like I can understand it pretty well after I do some research. When my doctor did testing for thyroid problems, I went home after the appointment and did a ton of research on it before I ever got the results. I wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting into. When she gave me meds, I went home to find out if there would be any side effects from it. 
0.694400	I understand all health related stuff except for the big medical words that i don't understand. I sometimes need help to learn what my condition is and how to fix it and such. I only need help when they use big  words to explain my conditons.

It's been a year and I am still trying to ascertain the estrogen at my age going away and the swelling and pain I am having. Trying lyrica but that is causing weight gain. Hard to get professionals to see me as not fat but swollen! I ask questions likely better than most because I have a child who has Cerebral Palsy with 2 VP Shunts for hydrocephalus who requires frequent shunt revisions. This has taught me to speak up since he cannot talk. I have to ask all questions and think all the time about what could be ""up."" I am not afraid to ask any question and when I do meet a stubborn provider for him I am now quick to tell them I will no longer need their services. Then I find another. For me, I usually am not as assertive."
0.916700	I am close to several health providers. I have no trouble reading and comprehending health information. When I see a doctor or other medical staff for health purposes, I make sure I understand all of the information they give me.

I feel very knowledgeable about my health; I'm confident I can make the right decisions for me and for my loved ones.
0.827800	I feel I can understand information to a basic degree. If something is too complicated, I am able to research the information myself and read it thoroughly to my understanding.
0.711100	I feel generally capable. Whenever I have health concerns or change medication I tend to do some research online beforehand. Then, when I have an appointment with my physician I can ask relevant questions and confirm what I've read. I'm not always prepared for the amount of information certain medical paperwork requires me to know, but it's never prevented me from being treated.
0.888900	I believe that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic and intermediate health information and services. The times that I have had issues have been related to interpersonal misunderstandings and friction. 
0.822200	I have an extensive medical history going back more than 20 years. Throughout that time I have been in situations that called for requests of my medical records and other related transcripts of my care. I also have been in need of more materials for my own understanding, as I have had more than 10 surgeries over the years and many procedures.  I have fulfilled the requests(for legal and Disability reasons) and supplied myself with what I needed too. I was in touch with anyone and everyone including, records department employees, APRNs, to people that are part of national health help organizations to the doctors themselves in order to obtain what I needed to get.
0.827800	I feel that I am almost always able to obtain, process and understand the information given to me, especially since most health professionals are willing to explain.

0.672200	I feel like I understand when I'm there with the medical staff, but I often forget later when I'm at home. Then I read things online and I either get scared or confused. 
0.794400	When the doctors tell me about a condition, if I do not understand I will ask them questions until I fully understand everything involved
0.916700	I rarely have any issues understanding my doctor or a nurse and if something doesn't make sense to me I ask them to elaborate on what I don't initially understand.  I occasionally have an issue getting in contact with my doctor by phone but it's understandable as he's busy and it's rare that I actually need to contact him anyhow as he tends to explain things well and answer any questions I have during my visits.
0.705600	I feel like I usually have a good understanding of basic health information.  I ask questions to have things explained until I get all the information I feel I need. 
0.850000	I can usually understand and process the information that I'm told or reading. Sometimes when reading, it's explained in such a way that is a little confusing, but when talking to someone, it's usually an easy concept to grasp.All in all, I generally understand the information I'm given pretty well.
0.583300	I feel very shy when I am at the doctors. I always write down things I want to say but then chicken out or forget. I feel intimidated at the doctors.
0.866700	I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG FIBROSIS IN 2008 AND SINCE HAVE BECOME PRETTY ADAPT AT OBTAIN INFORMATION THROUGH THE INTERNET AND ASKING QUESTIONS OF MY DOCTOR AND NURSES. I GENERALLY KEEP SEARCHING OR ASKING QUESTIONS UNTIL I KNOW OR UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH MY CONDITION.
0.805600	I feel like have the capacity and understand to understand medical information. However, I always feel like doctors do not take out the time to answer questions properly because I always feel rushed to get out. A lot of the time I find my self researching what the doctors were rushing to explain.
0.705600	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions a little more than the average person. I understand most things the doctor tells me, and ask doctors or nurses to explain things I don't understand. 
0.655600	I feel as though I have the full capacity to fully understand what health literature is presented to me in the hopes of fully understanding my health outcomes.

0.900000	I feel have the capacity to understand health information and services to a very high degree. I often research health conditions and review information given to me by doctors. I feel is in my best interest to be as well informed as possible in order to make good choices for me and my family. 
0.850000	I definitely feel I have the ability and capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information and services because my health is incredibly important to me and I am always diligent.  Between my doctor, credible online resources and friends and family, I thoroughly research prior to making health decisions.
0.794400	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed very well as long as the information is not given to me in terms that I don't understand, such as by using the name of a specific bacteria instead of just saying bacteria.
0.711100	I think I have the knowledge to get the basic health information and services I need to make the right choices for myself and my family. It is pretty clear whats asked and if I dont understand, I always make sure I ask questions.
0.827800	I think that I have the necessary knowledge to make educated questions or have a proper conversation about my health with my doctor. 
0.788900	I have taken enough health related classes and done enough research to know the questions to ask.  I know the basics of how my body functions and reacts.  This knowledge helps me to communicate better with my health professionals and get the help that I need
0.688900	I feel like I understand most of what is told to me regarding health information but sometimes I need help.  I rarely go to the doctor or get sick so I am not familiar with a lot of medical terminology or how processes work so I usually have to get either my wife or mother to help me understand things.  I usually consult someone if there is a big decision to make although that is extremely rare.
0.661100	I think I have a decent capacity to do so. At times healthcare professionals make me feel rushed and unable to answer questions which I would otherwise have anted to ask. 
0.916700	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I try to be an informed consumer / patient when it comes to my health and do my best to take care of myself.  I try to learn as much as I can about health conditions I may have as well as the best ways to take care of myself.  I like to stay healthy and live as healthy a lifestyle as possible.
0.644400	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions to an average degree. Sometimes I have questions that I do not have the answers to, but if I am motivated enough I will call or email my doctor to find an answer. Sometimes I will simply look up my question online to find a good answer. Other times I will ask my significant other or  a family member for advice.
0.522200	I have a biology/medical background so I feel somewhat more prepared than the average person. I get frustrated when I feel like I am being talked down to by medical personnel.
0.683300	I have so many health problems due to the Lupus, Sjogren's, and frequent infections. There are so many terms and conditions I am experiencing it is hard sometimes to retain the information. I oftentimes have to ask for clarification. I also have IBD and liver issues. Even if a doctor is rude, and I have had plenty of mean ones, I ask everything I can think of. It could be a matter of life and death, or just not feeling well. I have to get over my embarrassment and intimidation and ask what I need to. 
0.766700	For the most part I think I am able to understand basic health information.  Sometimes there are aspects of it that I don't grasp and that sometimes even asking for clarification I might still not get, but figure I can do more research online later as long as I remember the basics of what they told me.
0.777800	First of all, I usually will do some major indepth investigation upon my own to examine the facts, and then compare to what my medical staff is telling me, or suggesting that I do in their care. I absolutely do not put all of my faith in any one doctor or health professional, as many are simply wrong, or just doing what they are told to do by their superiors, which often is in the best interest of the pharmacutical and insurance companies. We as patients are sold to the highest bidder who then have control over our medical decisions. The outcome of my life is of no concern to these corporate entities, only the bottom line which determines the lowest cost factor for them, and the highest profit margins for the pharmacutical companies which the insurance provider can accept. It is in my best interest to know what these corporations are deciding, and through proper investigation, only I can really know if the medical care that I recieve is in my best interest.
0.900000	I am self sufficient in filling out forms. If I do not understand them, I have no issue calling someone or talking to someone at the office of where the forms need to go. Usually all the forms I fill out for medical stuff, is pretty generic and I have no problems understanding the questions they are asking. If I did have a problem, I can always call the doctors office and talk to someone. Usually I fill them out there at the doctor, so if I had any questions, I would not hesistate to ask the front desk. If they didn't know, I would talk to the nurse or the doctor to get the help I needed.
0.794400	I feel like I have a good understanding and capacity to obtain information I need. I always ask lots of questions to make sure I understand everything and when prescribed any kind of medicines I ask about side effects and comparable medicines, benefits and drawbacks of each, etc. I definitely like to be very well informed when it comes to my health.
0.866700	I ask my doctor or nurse to explain exactly what my health problem is.  With prescriptions, I ask the doctor what they are for, talk to the pharmacists to get a clearer idea of what the medicines do.  I also look up online at webmd or other medical websites. 
0.638900	I feel that most of the questions I have are answered. I am pretty knowledgeable myself but there are times where if feel like I need to ask about them. When I do. i feel i have the right resources to make it happen and feel confident if they don't know the answer. they can find someone who does.
0.883300	I feel that I am extremely qualified to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I am a retired pharmacist with 40 years of experience. Hope this won't disqualify me. I have to say that I am EXTREMELY grateful for my education and background because of the health care experience I had from July 2016 to Feb 2017. I have very good knowledge in researching information when I need to.
0.350000	I have a difficult time understanding medical terminology because it is so complicated and scientific. I often times need someone to verbally explain to me what a specific term or symptom means. Most of the time I feel lost and that I do not understand the cause of my symptoms or that I am just clueless why the health issue is occurring. When a doctor tries to explain it to me, I lose focus quickly because they are speaking too fast and talking about medical issues I am not educated about.
0.783300	I feel truly confident in my capacity to make appropriate health decisions. I can understand what the doctor says, and if I do not understand I am able to ask questions and clear my doubts. 
0.844400	I feel confident enough to understand basic and somewhat more complex health related information, services to ensure that I will be taking the correct approach to treating such health conditions. Anything that is out of the ordinary or too complex I would probably ask for a more thorough breakdown of what it is what I will be dealing with.
0.838900	I have the knowledge to listen to what they are saying and digest it and I make sure I ask questions if I have any and ask them to write some of the information down that allows me to then do online research and better understand it for the next time im in there
0.838900	I feel very confident in my own capacity to obtain and process basic health information. I have never had a problem with this in the past. 
0.900000	I feel that I can work through most health related decisions fairly well. Written materials are usually concise enough but I ask a lot of questions if I don't understand.
0.783300	I feel I have a reasonable ability to understand basic health information and services and that I have the basic ability to make decisions about my health.  I feel I have an average ability for comprehension and if there is something I do not understand I have the ability to look up the information I need to know. 
0.838900	For the most part, I'm pretty confident in my ability to get information about my health and use it to make decisions. The interplay between doctors, the practice they work for, insurance companies, multiple departments...etc. can be obscure at times, but not to the extent that it would seriously effect my health choices. 
0.833300	I haven't experienced many hospital visits, but when there I haven't had a difficult time understanding my medical issues. I have experienced long wait times even when I have had a scheduled appointment.
0.605600	I have the capacity to obtain and process material but sometimes there are medical vocabulary that I need someone to explain.
0.666700	I know how to get the information or help I need. I do like outside imput when there are medical decisions to be made. In the past Iâve felt Drâs donât adequately explain issues.
0.833300	I feel as if I have a decent understanding being able to understand the term of medical terminology. I also understand when my health is declining i know that I will have to go see a doctor to check on my health and receive treatment. 
0.627800	Although I can understand every day conversations, medical info can be difficult to read and interpret. There is often a lot of language that is unfamiliar and concepts that are not common. Sometimes when a doctor is speaking to me I don't feel comfortable asking questions as it seems as if I should be following.
0.788900	I think I have the ability to understand all of the basic health information that I am provided, and to use that information to make decisions about my health. I also have the full capacity to understand the various health services offered. 
0.705600	Given the fact that I work in the scientific field, I feel as if I'm predisposed to have a good basic understanding of medical terminology combined with an exceptional command of the English language. The only problem arises when the care provider is unable to fully describe the mechanisms of drugs for which they prescribe. That would be one of the few circumstances where I need assistance in making the best decision for my health.    
0.883300	I have been thru enough doctor and gospel visits that I can surely read and comprehend everything in the paper work and when speaking to a healthcare specialist
0.838900	It is fairly easy for me to understand what is going on with my health. I subscribe to my hospital and physicians' online service which supplies me with results of lab tests, clinic notes, and appointments. I have learned to navigate this online service fairly well. My biggest complaint is that some of my doctors don't adequately use the system so I still have to contact their offices for simple or routine matters.
0.838900	I feel, I understand most of the medical information I am given. If I do not I either ask the appropriate professional (Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, etc.) or I use a reputable website such WebMD.
0.744400	I think I am capable but hesitant when it comes to gathering health information. I can definitely do it but I am unsure because of the frequency in which I actually make use of certain information.
0.866700	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I will not approve of services that I don't fully understand the reason for or fully agree with the risks. i.e.risk vs. benefit
0.866700	I have very good nurses and doctors that are always willing to help and answer any questions. Our insurance also provides us with a nurses hotline if we need to ask any questions. When I fill prescriptions the pharmacists are always very helpful and make sure I understand everything. I also have several nurse friends that are always willing to answer any questions. 
0.811100	I think I'm fairly confident in being able to find and understand information. If I have any questions then I usually go online and do a lot of research. I like to be fully prepared and have good understanding to be able to ask any important questions.
0.866700	I feel very confident in my ability. Especially nowadays, when you can google and read more about any topic, I am sure that I could understand any medical information and make solid decisions. I might feel a little pressured in an appointment where the medical professional didn't have a lot of time to spend with me, but I would just go home and learn more about the topic through research, and call back for more info if necessary. I also have a great, experienced family who would help me understand anything I had questions about.
0.777800	Often forms are easily to fill out because they cover most concerns. Sometimes doctors do not ask if there are any questions and sometimes I forget to provide the questions. Mostly I understand or will look on  the web.
0.794400	I have a degree in kinesiology - an above-average knowledge of anatomy and physiology - and I still sometimes get lost in what doctors are trying to get at. I think sometimes doctors oversimplify in an effort to connect to patients and miss out on key words and important information. 
0.594400	I feel confident in understanding basic health information, but when the information presented is more complicated I tend to reach out to my mother who works in the medical field. 
0.627800	I feel like I have a basic capacity to understand most things, but often times when an issue arises I have difficulties understanding what went wrong. Especially with regards to more specific and less common medical and health concerns.
0.661100	I feel to some extent that I comprehend the information that they relay to me, however some medical terms are hard to follow, so I most of the time would do online research after leaving the appointment, I also google any prescribed medications so that way i'm well aware of what the side effects or outcome will be. Once I feel comfortable with the treatment prescribed then I will follow the recommended doses information.
0.661100	I prefer to talk about my health issues, concerns, problems with my husband. Often he sees things in a different light and his input helps me see all of my options and understand things better. I do feel I am capable of making any decision on my own but I'm more comfortable talking things over with my husband.
0.900000	I am responsible for taking care of the healthcare needs of myself and my kids. I have become capable of making any and all decisions. Anything the Dr. may mention or diagnoses I see on forms I receive, I will go out and google to get information on what may have caused it or what other recommendations for treatments might be offered other than those offered by my physician. I take care of my kids' needs and I am not afraid to ask questions when it comes to their health. There have even been times where I can't make it to their visits with them, but I am on the phone when the Dr. is talking to them and directing them to ask questions so that I feel I'm fully informed.
0.900000	I am quite confident that I can understand many aspects of medical terminology. I rarely have problems when speaking to doctors, nurses or medical staff and have never had a problem filling out forms.
0.861100	I'm positive I can obtain and understand basic health information. I'm a medical assistant, it's my job to have a basic understanding of human health and to ensure that our patients have an in depth understanding of their own health issues.
0.816700	I definitely feel I have the ability to understand and process my health information. I am of sound mind and pay attention. I tend to Google medical issues and problems before seeking a doctor, so I often have a general idea of what is wrong with me and even know some of the terminology before they tell me. Even after I am diagnosed, I do a ton of research to get more facts than the doctor would have told me and even hear or speak to others with the same problems.
0.705600	I feel like I understand most of the processes and information regarding my health. There are times that I don't completely understand, but I have my mom help me with those instances. I have a rare illness, so sometimes it's complicated to answer certain questions just due to the severity of my illness and the fact that my illness isn't completely understood by medical professionals.
0.861100	Filling out forms and explaining symptoms and circumstances are not a problem. I only ask basic questions when it comes to medical visits. As a fast paced person, I do not ask extra questions. 
0.916700	"obtain 10/10, I can research or ask them if I can't find it online; process 10/10, like I said, I can search texts for relevant information; understand 10/10, with the caveat that if it's the actual science it'll take a lot longer than if it's just ""treatment x versus treatment y"" type stuff"
0.888900	I can understand whatever the doctor tells me, whether spoken or written, If I need to I can research further online later. But a lot of that depends on the doctor too, some doctors explain things well, others just kind of assume you already know.
0.744400	Although medical jargon can be difficult to understand I feel pretty confident in filling out any medical forms necessary.  My reading comprehension is very high so I feel confident that even if there's terms or conditions I don't understand I can usually figure out the meaning by reading the context of the sentence.  Also, if I need to I can do research on my own and usually do concerning any symptoms I display.
0.866700	I have above average ability to understand written information. If I don't understand a work or jargon, I look it up on the internet. I reread to make sure I know how the condition may affect me. I feel pretty confident I understand the side effects of drugs before I take them. 
0.827800	I believe I can easily understand general and common medical terms and I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision. I usually seek for a second opinion or wait on exams before making any decisions pertaining my health or procedures I agree upon. I am very prone to do extra research should any health issues appear and try to gather all the information I can and bring all questions to a doctor, although it mesmerizes me the lack in tests and exams I see in the health industry, most diagnostics are given based on symptoms and not exams. 
0.727800	Health information is so important that sometimes it may be overthought of something too simple. However, in most cases there are times where I do need help in regards to medical forms that need to be filled out of have questions for the doctor. therefore, a lot of questions that can be given in a written format may require too much of a distinct jargon that couldn't be understand. Making the right health deicisons are important especially if it medical history in your family such as diabetes,  high blood pressure, and other health risk. it is always right seek out the best information. 
0.850000	I'm 52 and have a fair amont of experience with health issues and the care provided. I've yet to fail to fully understand everthing provided to me in a healthcare setting.
0.555600	At times it becomes difficult to understand what is wrong with me and I need multiple explanations to try understand what to do and where to go from there.I feel like I can understand what is happening but only at the bare minimum since I get lost at times when the doctor explains in an understanding where I have no clue what is happening so I need explanations that I can understand. At times I don't have everything to make a health decision.
0.733300	I feel that when I have the time to discuss my health with a doctor or nurse that I can generally understand the information they are giving me.  Sometimes, when time is a factor and I have been given written information, that information is not always clear.  In those instances, it can be confusing and difficult to get a hold of someone to answer my questions.
0.827800	I feel like I am moderately able to understand and process the information. With the help of better educated friends and family I am able to get a better understanding without much trouble.
0.416700	Most of the time I feel out of place. The explanations the doctors give have such high medical vocabulary that it is difficult to understand what they are saying. I feel I get lost in the middle of their explanation. When something is hand written by a doctor for a prescription it is even worse since half of the time I cant understand what they are writing wether it is the name of a medicine or the instructions on how to take them. The procedures are also hard to understand. It all comes down to the amount of endless information I fell I am given by the doctors. Its too much to take at once, most of the time.
0.738900	I feel that I have a good sense of common medical terms and services.  If there is something I am not sure of or fully understand, there are a lot of resources available to me such as Google.  I am comfortable researching this on my own.
0.883300	As an attorney for 30 years I represented many medical providers dealing with associate rules, HIPAA rules etc. I am well versed in contracts and medical issues/terms 
0.916700	I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I do not have any mental issues that make me incapable of understanding things and making decisions.  I have 100% of my mental capacity and am very good at understanding medical information.
0.788900	"I feel pretty educated on my health conditions and feel confident in my doctors.  However, there are times when I still don't feel I have all the information I need to make health decisions.  Often, doctors are unable to ""dumb down"" language to the point where a lay person could understand.  Additionally, I feel that my time with doctors is limited.  I rarely feel that I have had as much time as I wanted.  Insurance forms are also very difficult to understand.  I almost feel like I need to have a lawyer look over everything!  Often the receptionists do not seem educated in health language."
0.800000	I was a certified CNA at one point and have worked in the healthcare industry for several years. I have a high capacity to understand basic healh information to make health decisions for myself. I will always ask doctors to explain anything I do not understand until I can understand it fully.
0.855600	I think I have the skills that I need to take care of myself. I haven't had much trouble understanding any of my medical conditions. I would consider myself fairly literate when it comes to my health.
0.838900	I have worked in healthcare and I make sure to understand my medical conditions/medications as well as I can. I don't always think of the right questions in the moment, but I'm a curious person and want to stay up to date with new info.

0.711100	I am a visual learner, yes, but I have more than enough competency to ask and re-ask questions that I need until I have information that is not only useful but coherent. I will read instructions and carefully write myself notes so I don't forget anything. 
0.722200	I feel very confident that on the occasions that I do visit the doctor's office, I am capable of understanding conditions as well as treatments that are necessary. If I am unsure, I am not afraid to ask.
0.777800	I feel I can get all information I need and understand instructions. The problem area that I usually have is when it comes to insurance papers. Luckily I have a sister that works in the insurance dept. of our local clinic and am able to get help from her. I often think of what the poor people do that don't have access to someone like that and what I would do if she wasn't there to help.
0.561100	Reducing hospital load, meeting better needs of medical examination and treatment of people is an important target has been set by the Ministry of Health for many years. To realize this problem, the Ministry is focusing on combining many solutions on health financing mechanisms and policies. In particular, solutions to mobilize resources from the society to invest in facilities, equipment, cooperation on management, improve the quality of the health system is expected to bring efficiency positive.
0.611100	I believe that I am in good standing when it comes to obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. I believe this is because, I have learned and are aware of asking questions, reading labels, and doing my own research.
0.772200	I feel strongly that one, due to the get them in and out in 15 minutes has to often go to outside sources to help with their own health care. It often takes longer to fill out forms pre doc visit than the time that is spent with a person and that they only glance at the forms. Thankfully there is google and many other seach engines and websites and forums where one can practically, at least with simple maladies, get all the information they need.  I feel personal I have the capacity, I feel strongly that doctors and nurses do not take the time to explain as they should. 
0.900000	I think I am able to understand the heath related questions. Sometimes I may not be clear on the problem or I might come home and forget to ask a question to the doctor 
0.794400	I feel that I normally comprehend about 90% of the information that is given to me, however, there have been occasions that I've had questions about drug interactions that I found difficult to get direct answers about.
0.827800	My doctor is very good at taking her time and explaining things. My family is in a few health occupations and explain a lot to me too. I read about staying healthy.
0.883300	I feel I have the capacity to understand materials presented to me. I also feel like I know how to form questions to get the answers I need. I do not struggle communicating with health care professionals.
0.900000	I feel that I am well able to process all the information needed to make intelligent health decisions. I can easily understand written and spoken information, and I research health topics that concern me.
0.900000	I have been with the same doctor for about 15 years. I am very comfortable asking him questions about any issues I have. I do not feel like he rushes to get me out of the office. He takes his time and answers my questions. He is thorough in all my health care needs.
0.833300	I feel mostly confident in my capacity to do the above. With the Internet as a resource if there is something in a pamphlet that seems unclear to me I can often do some reading to clear up any confusion. I am comfortable with my doctor and he answers my questions well. I have had doctors in the past that answered my medical questions as though I were another doctor. Sometimes that made understanding my conditions or the decisions that were being made regarding them difficult to understand. I think doctors just need to remember that sometimes the most simple way for them to explain something might not be as easy to understand for some of their patients.
0.883300	I think I'm pretty good at understanding things. I usually repeat the information back to health professionals in my own words so they can correct me if I haven't gotten it right. I read written information provided by hospitals or doctor offices; I don't always read all the prescription fine print. When I'm back home, I look online (usually WebMD) and read up on topics that were raised.
0.916700	I feel that I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and the services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
0.916700	I am a college educated individual and believe that I have the mental capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have health insurance and regularly go to my primary care physician and eye doctor for frequent check-ups. The key is to be honest with your doctors on any potential issues that I might be having.
0.800000	I feel very confident in understanding the science of medications and medical problems. However, insurances deliberately try to make forms, processes and procedures difficult for the patient and medical professionals in order to avoid paying. The fear of being stuck with the bill is enough to deter me and most others from seeking medical attention. 
0.900000	I feel I understand the majority of the information given to me by my providers. I have studied in the medical field and therefore already know the basics and a lot of speciality information. The information that I have trouble with or know nothing about I know to ask my provider to fully explain and tell me what values are suggested for lab/image results if a part of the diagnosis.
0.633300	I am somewhat familiar with health terms and can pretty much figure out health related material on my own. If there is a term I don't understand, I ask a professional.
0.900000	I understand my medical history and my doctor has taken the necessary time to discuss it with me.  I am a member of a good health group and can also find a lot of information on the website.
0.900000	I feel most confident regarding my healthcare and health conditions. I worked in the field of medical care for over ten years and had the privilege of working with many great physicians and nurses. I have a good understanding of medical terms and feel comfortable with reading medically focused materials, including conditions or diagnoses that I may be faced with.
0.900000	I feel that I have a high degree of confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic healthy information and services I need to make appropriate health decision.
0.633300	I can understand most of the basic questions. The problem that I have is when the doctor or nurse use medical terms in which I've never heard of or when I'm filling out forms. So I can and feel confident that I can obtain basic or certain information to make the appropriate health decisions. I just can't do it when it gets too technical. 
0.622200	I feel as tho I have could handle all that basic information. As long as I can have all the information I would need I should not be that hard.
0.761100	I feel very confident about my ability to make health decisions. All of my doctors belong to the same health system and have access to my medical records.  This is useful for when they need to prescribe something - they have immediate access to see what else I'm taking to be sure something new won't interfere.
0.866700	I feel that my capacity extends as far as what I feel comfortable with. These health questions and decisions, I feel, are rarely out of someone with a normal high school education's capacity to handle. I feel that if the health decision is not to the best of my judgment, then I will seek the appropriate health professional. I also feel that most health care professionals would take the time to better explain to their patients, if there was some kind of misunderstanding. This would in turn lead to a more patient/doctor trustworthiness, which would benefit the overall performance of the hospital.
0.900000	I have easy access to the answers that I need for any medical information.  A hospital is very close to my whose and I can use Google to find out whatever I need to know.  Also, I have friends and acquaintances who are on the medical field who I can ask questions.  Anytime a doctor explains something to me, they usually say it in a way that I can easily understand.  Also, they never use big medical words that I can't understand.  It's very easy to simply ask the doctor everything you need to know about any medical condition that you have.  
0.916700	I believe at this point in time, health information is there if you are willing to seek it out. The web is ever expanding in regards to the information available, health provider apps are becoming more robust, and I happen to work at a call center (Carenet) that works to fill gaps in the consumer healthcare experience through providing various health provider services. However, for most people, I believe they are somewhat in the dark. The doctor's offices I've always been too do a terrible job of providing knowledge unless it's a doctor trying to prove they know the jargon. Clerical staff usually seem to avoid customers at any cost and ironically have terrible customer service (for the most part). Most offices have the same 30 year old graphics of the inner ear workings alongside  numerous posters advertising designer drugs. It'd be nicer if doctors offices were part medical care, part personal medical library. Plus, nobody really likes to reach out for health/insurance related information. I think it takes the external people who have a stake in that persons health (insurance providers) reaching out with info and care plans.
0.616700	i can understand basic health information provided by my doctor or nurse. Sometimes i need someone to explain to me  what exactly my medical papers telling me and what i need to do and sometimes hard to make my health decision i don't understand all my medical papers provided by my doctor or nurse and needing someone else to explain to me. 
0.777800	I have access to many resources to be able to make health decisions. Those resources include doctors, nurses, medical books, and the internet.
0.916700	I think my ability to understand and comprehend medical terminology when it comes to reading medical information given to me by a doctor is sufficient.  The majority of times  I get information from a doctor though it may have some medical terminology most of the information is easy to comprehend.  This is what gives me the confidence to say that I can be able to understand most of what the doctor writes me in a medical form.
0.772200	Are usually donât have any issues when it comes to reading information documents reports that concerning my medical issues it is pretty much easily comprehendible and usually thereâs always somebody on standby you call his ass questions
0.866700	I feel that I have possess the codependency to comprehend basic health information, and slightly higher capacity at interpreting medical terminology.
0.900000	I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information given to me by a health care provider so I am able to make an informed decision. I generally know what questions I need to ask to get the information I need, and try to give doctors and nurses enough information for them to treat me effectively. I occasionally ask for assistance from my wife recalling dates of shots and so on when filling out forms, but I donât think that is unusual. I think I am as capable as most people of making appropriate health decisions. I have some hearing loss, so it is helpful to have my wife along when discussing things with a health care worker so I donât misunderstand or nor hear something, but I can comprehend what is being said and am able to make necessary decisions.
0.722200	When it comes to basic issues I feel as though I have the ability to interpret them on my own.  However, when we start to get into more complex issues I often need someone with knowledge to make the explanation easier for me.
0.888900	I am pretty confident with reading medical materials I constantly freeze proof read every documents and ask a lot of questions anything I don't understand I always Google it
0.672200	I feel that I have the intellectual capacity to comprehend what I'm told.  The problem is that both I and the medical professionals I'm speaking with are working with a time limit that does not allow for an actual question-and-answer session or a real mutual understanding.
0.916700	I AM TOTALLY CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION AS I HAVE A MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS WORKED MOST OF MY WORKING YEARS IN THE HEALTH FIELD. I CAN OBTAIN, ,PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND ALL HEALTH INFORMATION GIVEN TO ME AND IF PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND I WILL ASK ALOT OF QUESTIONS TO HELP ME COMPREHEND BETTER. 
0.827800	I feel that with the internet and the ability to call my hospital with any questions, I have quite amount of information in order to make appropriate health decisions
0.822200	I feel I am very capable of everything I Need. i am used to going to the doctor and asking the questions necessary so that I get the information I Need in relation to my health problems. I go to the doctor so frequently that this is never an issue for me and if I do not understand something I'm very sure to ask questions. Sometimes if it's a new doctor I feel they don't always respond the way they need to or take the time they should but I make sure I get what i need.
0.677800	I am very in-tune with my own physical and mental health, and when I believe there is an issue I need to discuss with a doctor I seek out the appropriate resources. The internet is a wonderful tool to research different things and determine the right questions to ask. I also work in the medical field so I understand the logic and reasoning of doctors. So when I am told something about my own health, and if I don't understand any aspect of what I'm told, I know to ask them t explain in a different way until I can make an informed decision.
0.916700	I feel confident that I can obtain, process and understand all the basic health information to make the appropriate health decisions. And if I do not understand something then I would ask my doctor.
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to completely understand and process basic health information. I always ask doctors relevant questions during medical appointments. If I donât understand something I always ask the doctor to explain the material until I do understand. If I were to go to a doctor that didnât thoroughly explain things then I would discontinue services with that doctor and find a new one. 
0.883300	I generally feel like I am able to understand almost all of what my doctors tell me.  If I have difficulty with materials, I am capable of googling the correct information.  I often help others interpret medical information.
0.788900	I do a lot of research online usually before I see the doctor. I am sensible about it though and just use the information so when I talk to the doctor I know what they are talking about usually. I think medicine is very interesting but I do have an anxiety disorder that prevents me from seeking all the proper care I need. I generally understand what I am told and if I don't I usually ask or research it later. 
0.850000	I I think I feel quite confident about my capacity to understand most of health info and services needed to be able to make proper health decisions. I am able to fill all the necessary medical forms and easily interact with doctors or nurses in case anything needs to be clarified upfront. I also do thorough research by myself on the health info and services to make sure I make a proper health decisions at the end of the day. From time to time I also help my wife on these decisions. 
0.666700	I think I have the ability to make my own health decisions because I am very smart. I can process information then make a decision.
0.883300	I definitely feel I have the capacity to use information to make health decisions, largely because I have had the opportunity to work with and around a variety of different clinicians and am comfortable with medical jargon.
0.883300	I feel like I have basic general knowledge about medical needs.  If I have questions and need additional information, I will either ask my doctor or nurse, or look up the information online.  Normally I can find out the information easily and without much issue.
0.572222	i understand a little only because they don't simplify what it is they are trying to tell me. so therefore i just don't understand most of the time. 
0.794444	I can always ask someone in the medical field if I'm concerned about something.  I can also go to medical websites.
0.916667	At 43 I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions and I do not have any difficulties filling out paperwork.
0.688889	I don't know sometimes it's difficult I need help to know what I'm doing and asking all the questions correctly

0.550000	Great health is important to my body and to my family and  to stay fitness and looking good and eating right 
0.594444	I'm hearing impaired so I got to have an interpreter with me at my doctor appointments or anywhere that's important because without an interpreter it can be confusion for me to understand what the doctor or the person said to me

I say this because altho' I keep a list of points to cover, those in the healthcare industry mean well, yet they are time-strapped, the environment is stressed, focus is not always laser-fine, thus things get missed, re-directed, misinterpreted, etc.  Teamwork makes the dream work, so I try, they try, we try, Pobody's Nerfect and 100% is not feasible.

0.550000	They give potential job applicants a sense of whether they should apply for the job. The clearer you can be about the requirements, duties, and responsibilities of the job and what kind of person you're looking for, and the better you can represent these in your advertising for the job, the less time you'll have to spend reading applications from inappropriate candidates. The act of developing job descriptions and selection criteria forces you to clarify your thinking about the position, the kind of person you want for it, and the organization itself. Organizations often have to include job descriptions in proposals for new programs or positions. Sometimes, the act of composing the job description changes the whole course of the proposal, as people realize that they can use a position in ways they hadn't considered, or that what they had originally conceived was, in fact, unworkable. A job description can sometimes serve to define a whole program.
