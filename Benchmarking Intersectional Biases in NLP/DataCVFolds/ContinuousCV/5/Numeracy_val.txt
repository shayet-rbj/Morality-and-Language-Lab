1.000000	The more often a person is prescribed antibiotics the less effective they will be.  When I do have sinusitis that is bad enough to make me actually see a doctor (feeling like I am dying) I have to tell them not to bother writing a script for amoxicillin because I won't bother filling it as it will not work, it's like eating a bottle of Tic Tacs for me at this point.

0.857100	At my new apartment I would a sudden rash appear on my body at certain times during the day. In particular it would take place at evenings. My doctor initially diagnosed it as eczema. However what did not make sense it that why it would appear at certain times during the day.  Someone told me to give zyrtec a shot the next time it came up.

I didn't know what was wrong with me at first, but based on symptoms I'd heard of, plus knowing that I'm supposed to go to the hospital if I'm vomiting so much I can't keep liquids down, I suspected that I had appendicitis.

He could only have so much lasix or his kidneys would shut down, too little and he would swell with fluid. Less than a year from that. The exact same thing happened to my grandfather. So I knew the stages that would be happening to him because of the dog's issue. Lo and behold he lived a year just like the dog and passed away the same way as the dog.

0.500000	fill out all my own forms, filled out my healthcare forms
0.785714	Breast cancer taught me how little I know about the cancer and its treatments.

0.642857	Loosing weight has demonstrated that my knowledge of medical issues that would decrease with weight loss helped motivate me
1.000000	I researched a lot into chronic rhinitis before going to the doctor for the fifth time or so.  When I was there, based on what I read I thought that what the doctor was advising me to take didn't make much sense because I know that I don't have allergies and past antihistimines haven't helped me, so I asked if something might be better than that.  He gave me something different, which didn't help either unfortunately.

0.714300	A lot of it was simple math at the end of the day. They are all just words that deal with percentages, so you just have to be able to mix the math without the emotiol response. I have a lot of history with medical issues and experiences but it's all just a percentage with medicines, issues, and sickness.
0.714300	I think just living through a medical problem, not even your own, helps you gain knowledge. I learned a lot about cancer watching my mother go through it. You learn about the problems, and things that drs dont tell you

1.000000	My father had a brain tumor, it was a Glioblastoma. It was not found until it was very large and even with surgery they could not do much with it. I spent the next month learning all I could about that form of tumor and the available treatments. I spent days trying to find any trials or experimental treatments that might work. I found one at Duke and was able to get him enrolled but he passed away before the trial began. 
0.928600	When I had a severe injury.  I was on several medications at a time and had to organize what to take and how much.  I needed to read them carefully. 
0.428600	Hereditary issues arise in my family ranging from heart disease to thyroid. The thyroid issue can be affected at any age but the heart issues are later like menopause age, so i know what i can and can not help or try to minimize at best.
0.714300	When one of my daughters was ill, I knew that she was in a medical emergency situation as her fever shot very high. Though she was an adult, I knew she was incapable of handling this herself and rushed her to the ER, which the doctors said was good and immediately gave her treatment to bring down the temp safely and quickly. I was her advocate and wouldn't stop explaining her other symptoms, which they ran extensive tests on after I insisted and found the root cause. It was at that point they were able to correctly give her the medicine to properly treat her condition.
0.714286	A friend of mine had a regular check in with her GYN, and her pap smear came back with an abnormal reading and she was incredibly worried. I knew that abnormal readings didn't always mean that something was wrong, that sometimes there was just an error with the system, and assured her that everything was probably fine. When they did a test on her actual sample, it came back negative, and she was very relieved.

0.142857	hen I was twelve years old, a drunk driver hit the car my mother was driving while I was in the backseat. I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a personal level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors. It was as if my doctors and I had a silent bond. Now that Iâm older I fear death and sickness in a more intense way than I remember experiencing it as a child. My experience as a child sparked a keen interest in how we approach pediatric care, especially as it relates to our psychological and emotional support of children facing serious medical conditions. It was here that I experienced first-hand the power and compassion of medicine, 
0.785700	I was very underweight and highschool and I made it a goal for myself to get healthy and build muscle. This led me to do lots of research on exercising and nutrition. I also took many college classes on health, nutrition, and kinesiology. 
0.857100	My husband had high cholesterol, high triglycerides high blood pressure and hypothyroid. I have done a ton of research and even called experts in the fields and asked for advice. My husband would not take statins drugs. He will only take his synthroid for the hypothyroid. With diet, supplements, exercise and good advice from experts he no longer has high blood pressure or high triglycerides. I have his cholesterol in a good range which is just a hair below treatment and he feels very good. I myself only take supplements and all my tests come back normal because I believe in taking care of my health. I have the osteoporosis only and I have that under control.
0.571429	When I visited a urgent care one time, on a major hand eczema breakout, they tried to give me the wrong cream medication. I always carrying information on medication that I take, so I had to correct them on that issue and was giving the right cream.

0.714300	"When I was 37 years old, I discovered a flat but palpable tumor under my  left breast. It was found to be ""hot"" and otherwise suspicious, plus I had other small spots show up in the mammogram in my right breast. Biopsies were done and no cancer found, but the surgeon, at the time, recommended bilateral, subcutaneous mastectomies. After talking with my husband, my PCP, and others, plus doing a lot of research, I filly decided to go ahead. One year later, I was referred to a reconstructive surgeon who placed silicone implants under both breast flaps.  I still have those same implants and I'm now 81. I've had no problems with them. Of course, the various doctors get the credit for good work and incredible support for me, but I also take credit for studying the issue and making a hard decision that I feel helped keep me safe from cancer all these years."
0.857143	Every time I ate at a buffet or ate too much at any meal I would have explosive diarrhea and cramping. I was sure I had IBS after monitoring my diet and keeping track of the times I experienced these symptoms. I went to my Dr. Told him I was sure I had IBS, after exams and listening to my symptoms and reading my notes on my diet and symptoms he agreed. He does shake his head sometimes when I share something I read online but for the most part,I go in and tell him what I have and 90% of the time, I am correct. 
0.571429	I don't have much medical knowledge. I do know basic first aid and know what to do in emergency situations.

0.642900	At my current doctor I was interviewing her to see if I wanted to take my youngest son there. I asked her if she was familiar with intact (uncircumcised) care. This is a topic I've researched thoroughly and know pretty much everything about and know that many doctors aren't educated on it. She informed me that no she wasn't informed , but tried to give me false information after that. I then quoted the AAP (which she is supposed to be following) and what they state for the proper care and yet she still argued with me. 
0.500000	when I had a chronic illness I had to look up all of the information known about it because most doctors still use methods that were taught 50 years ago, are outdated and do not treat the patient, disease or their pain. 
0.928571	When I changed from employer provided health insurance to Medicare, I was able to switch back to a combination of drugs to help control my blood sugar levels. My former coverage wouldn't pay for both Metformin & Januvia, but Medicare will.
0.857100	Recently I had a tubal ligation.  I was talking with a friend who was slightly misinformed about the potential side effects of the procedure.  Since I had recently learned a lot about it, I helped to correct her.  She stated that in most cases, the blood vessel supplying the ovary would be cut along with the Fallopian tube.  I informed her that not only was this very rare, if it did happen to someone she knew, they could probably sue for malpractice.  My doctor personally assured me, and she has done so many procedures she lost count a long time ago, she had never seen it happen where the blood vessel was cut.  So I let my friend know about it, and she was pleasantly surprised.

I looked up problems with the epididymis and found, unsurprisingly, that there is a condition called epididymitis, and I knew right away that ""-itis"" means that something is inflamed, so I knew from the name that I was experiencing an inflammation of some kind. I went to the doctor who confirmed the diagnosis and gave me an antibiotic.

1.000000	Last year I was at my mother's. She lives in a senior facility. There is a lake on property that we walk to often. One day we arrived at the lake and there was a male resident, wheelchair bound, there. He appeared to be asleep. My mother didn't realize he was there. I immediately had concern. One of those feelings you can't explain. I decided to just keep an eye on him while we were feeding the turtles. I would look his way often and noticed he had moved his wheelchair into a different position. I continued to observe him, but I looked away for a few minutes. Next thing I know he was lying prone on the ground. It appeared that he was grabbing at a tree to pull himself up. That did it for me and I went over to offer my assistance. When I got to him he refused my help. And I realized he was using the tree to push himself to the water. He was going to commit suicide. I used my knowledge of depression (I have suffered through my own recurrent depression for 20 years) and began talking to him and listening to him all while trying to physically hold him still. I became his friend for those moments he really needed someone. I may have been the one who saved his life, but God gave me the calm and physical strength to hold him until some more help arrived.

0.857100	My brother had been in the hospital and he didn't have insurance. We lived in NJ at the time and they add an additional amount onto your bill as an uninsured patients fund. I believe it was about 50% of the bill. I called around and after much effort discovered that uninsured patients weren't required to pay this part of the bill. It was only for insurance companies. I eventually received a form from the state of NJ and had my brother complete it and he mailed it. After we received the response, I still had to travel to the hospital and show it to the billing office because they were still refusing to adjust his bill. After I provided them with a copy of the response, they eventually adjusted his bill and he was able to pay the rest of the bill with the assistance of a plan he had that paid him for every day he spent in the hospital (about nine days). Sorry, this is the only experience I had that was related to your question.

0.500000	"An experience that demonstrated my knowledge was at my friends place. My friend's father complained about swelling on a bruise located on this kneecap. He apparently still believes in old methods of injuries and says that there is bad ""chi"" blocking. He would take a slipper to smack the bruise and this gives him relief. I was really shocked at this thinking and I had to stop him and explained that the swelling is because the vessels are damaged so the blood is clogged in the area which gives the swelling look.

The lady just said it was probably a bug bite and nothing serious.  I hadn't ever had a reaction like this to a bug before and knew that where the bump was, on my back near my spine, that I needed to get another opinion.

1.000000	My doctor casually mentioned Kleinfelter's syndrome and was surprised that I knew what it was. I don't have Kleinfelter's syndrome, and I really can't remember why I read about it in the first place. We talked about it for a little bit and then moved on with the checkup.

1.000000	I suppose having had the flu throughout my childhood has shown me when I should panic, or when it is just general symptoms of the flu.  So this (very) basic knowledge lets me know that I just have the flu.
