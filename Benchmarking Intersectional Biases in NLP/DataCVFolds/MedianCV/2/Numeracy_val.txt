Since I had recently learned a lot about it, I helped to correct her.  She stated that in most cases, the blood vessel supplying the ovary would be cut along with the Fallopian tube.  I informed her that not only was this very rare, if it did happen to someone she knew, they could probably sue for malpractice.  My doctor personally assured me, and she has done so many procedures she lost count a long time ago, she had never seen it happen where the blood vessel was cut.
