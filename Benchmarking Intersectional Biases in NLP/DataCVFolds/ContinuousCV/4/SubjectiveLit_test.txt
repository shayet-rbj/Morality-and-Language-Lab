0.822200	I believe I can make appropriate health decision as well as most other people. I do my best to stay informed and do extra reading on the internet.
0.866700	well I know abit about the terms and all that from biology and medical classes in school, so I know a bit about what they are talking about even if its in latin. figuring out all the insurance stuff is actually the biggest hassle i've had 
0.866700	I feel that I have the capacity to understand a good amount of what doctors or nurses are telling me because I work in the medical field. If I did not, I think it would be much more confusing as a patient,
0.900000	I have the full capacity to understand, obtain, and process basic health information because I am literate. I have a large vocabulary and speak and write English fluently.
0.861100	I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information because even if it something that I don't understand I ask questions. I have the know how to look up conditions on the internet and be able to isolate the questions that I would need to ask my health care professiol.
0.800000	Regarding the information that I obtain from medical staff I usually understand the process I will be foregoing and I understand health information. Being I have heart issues that are chronic I try to listen very carefully.
0.861111	im very capable of doing all my  own medical forms from the doctors and hospitals - i always ask questionds to make sure i have all my information is right
0.683300	I think I do. Sometimes I don't quite understand how to fill out the forms, because the forms are different depending on the place you are at. My last appointment the forms were different a bit, and I signed in the incorrect place, and they had to redo them. 
0.755556	I have no issues asking questions if I do not understand something that has been presented in a way I do not understand. 
0.755556	I feel that I can obtain and understand information about my health, but sometimes don't know what questions I need to ask to get a thorough understanding.
0.588900	I read the bottle labels to understand what is asked of me when i take the medications that i have.I have a bit of understanding from previous medications that i have taking in the pass because it seems like all medications are close the the same 
0.888889	I read everything, research and ask questions until I understand and will fill out papers accordingly even if it takes me a while to figure things out
0.900000	I feel I have the capacity to understand basic health information given to me. And believe I can make appropriate health decisions based on the information given to me and my understanding of the information.
0.788900	For the most part, I feel I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I sometimes feel my doctor does not adequately understand my condition, as I am in a rural area with few options. This makes it difficult. 
0.833333	Have the intelligence to understand  most basic information regarding medical situations that effect myself or the family.
0.916667	I have complete faith in my ability to read, understand and seek any information if needed regarding my own healthcare and related services.
0.861100	I think I have a fairly good grasp on my ability to obtain and understand important information regarding my own health. I try not to be shy or embarrassed when asking for help from my doctor or physician. It can be difficult to convey a specific feeling or discomfort but I try my best. I think I have good healthcare professionals looking after me!
0.688900	We have access to so much information now it is overwhelming to determine which is accurate.  I can find information easily but I do not always know if it is correct.  I find it best to speak to someone in person or on the phone to get the most accurate information.
0.783300	I am very capable of understanding and reading health information, wether from a nurse practitioner, M.D. or specialist. If anything ever sounds confusing I am not ashamed to ask for detailed information regarding the issue. 
0.661111	I am sure if I really needed information I could go online or I could ask my doctor for all the information I need or ask a family member 
0.916667	I feel like I contain all of the knowledge I need to take care of myself. It's my body so I should understand its problems.
0.916700	This may sound a bit pompous, but I have a fairly easy time understanding health information for two reason. First, I work in healthcare. I have worked in healthcare for 12 years. I'm also just smart. (See? Sounds conceited, but I don't mean it that way.) I am the one that every one of my family and friends come to for medical help or advice. 
0.822222	I feel that, for the most part, I can comprehend health information. Access to health care is another issue, however, especially women's health care.
0.850000	I am a  brittle typp 1 diabetic. I  have been googleing things  for  years and am a member of many diabetic support groups.  We all share our storys  and all healp each other understand what is wrong with us. the docots  only see  part of the story  but they dont understand the full story  
0.866700	I believe I can understand the conversations I have had with a personal physician so far.  I am 70 years old but am basically healthy other than aches and pains, and see a doctor once a year for a physical. 
0.883333	I obtain, process,and understand every thing they tell me; if not I'll ask them to explain further so I can get a good understanding.
0.844400	English is my tive language so I understand the forms I'm filling out and the conversations I'm having with my doctors.  I'm also relatively young, and do not have dimentia or other type of mental processing blocks.  
0.444400	"I feel like I have the capability to understand very basic health information, but anything beyond the basics presents a challenge to me.  I find it very confusing and a lot of times, doctors are so smart in their profession that they don't know how to ""dumb it down"" for me."
0.883300	I think I have a pretty high capacity. I can ask questions to better understand what I'm being told and I can always access the Internet if I need further explations. 
0.794444	understand basic knowledge and listen to what they say. can read the materials they give me and answer the questions
0.811100	I feel like I have a higher than normal capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I do a lot of research whenever I come up to something I don't know.  So, I have acquired a lot of knowledge on health when dealing with insurances, babies, etc.
0.772200	I feel strongly that one, due to the get them in and out in 15 minutes has to often go to outside sources to help with their own health care. It often takes longer to fill out forms pre doc visit than the time that is spent with a person and that they only glance at the forms. Thankfully there is google and many other seach engines and websites and forums where one can practically, at least with simple maladies, get all the information they need.  I feel personal I have the capacity, I feel strongly that doctors and nurses do not take the time to explain as they should. 
0.850000	I think I'm pretty good at it. When I don't understand something I am sure to get help from someone who does know what I need to do. 
0.811111	I have the ability to comprehend what is being said to me .But sometimes things are said and im totally confused but then they break it down for me. Therefore I'm not confused anymore 
0.800000	I feel like I have enough knowledge about basic health situations to understand what my doctor is telling me. If I look confused when my doctor tells me something they will often explain what I need to know. I do not feel like I would understand things that are more uncommon like serious diseases or complicated insurance limitations.
0.866700	I feel I have the capacity to understand health information. If I receive a diagnosis or prognosis that I can't understand or if a medical professiol uses too much jargon too quickly, I often repeat back to the professiol what I understand and allow them to clarify or correct me if I'm not understanding them. 
0.700000	I believe that I do have the ability to obtain process and understand basic information, but sometimes the way it is conveyed is difficult to understand, and they use too many âdoctorâ terms that normal people do not understand.
0.916700	I feel confident in my ability to handle health information. I have a background in health insurance, so that part of the equation is very easily understood. I also have fine research skills, a large vocabulary and enough general experience at the age of 48, that I know how to find out anything, of which I am unsure. I'm ufraid to speak with health care professiols. 
0.900000	I feel that I have a good understanding of what my health care provider tells me. If not, I'm comfortable enough to ask questions until I understand. So I'm completely comfortable in making appropriate health decisions.
0.916700	I usually understand most of the information that is given to me.
0.916667	I have the capacity to read and understand materials I am given to read.  I was educated before the federal government got involved in education, know how to think and am not politically correct.
0.916667	my  mind is fully intact, so i am capable of doing for myself....i do not need anyone's help....i usually help other people
0.733300	With all the changes that occur on a daily basis, I think it is not realistic to expect the public to keep up with what is right or appropriate when it comes to medicine.  I believe I can process the basic information but I know that to do things correctly, the basics do not always take care of everything that we need to know.  Obtaining the right information, now thanks to the internet, is easy to get you just have to make sure that the sites that you go to are reputable. 
0.794400	I feel mostly confident in communicating with health professionals. On the rare occasion I may not ask a question out of shyness.
0.616667	I know how to treat myself if I have a cut nd if my skin is burning, I also know how to do cpr or help someone who is out of breath
0.777800	I believe I have a good capacity to make health related decisions.
0.883300	I feel confident in reading and understanding medical information that is spelled out for non medical professionals. I feel that I have basic understanding of health related issues. 
0.883300	Yes, I feel as though I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health info. I can make appropriate decisions regarding healthcare independently and do have a source of help should I have a question.
0.777800	I feel I can obtain, process and understand my health information to a mostly satisfactory degree. There have been some instances in the past where I have had trouble understanding what a doctor tells me. In those cases I will ask nurses for clarification, and I also changed my doctor to get someone who communicated better to me. 
0.727800	I believe in understanding documents and filling out forms I find it easy to process and understand. It is when I need more information and have to ask the questions where I do stumble and or tend to ask the wrong things or word it weirdly. I have horrible social anxiety which does not help one bit.
0.738900	i feel that I have at least an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a major issue attempting to process said information, and any minor issue has been quickly resolved. 
0.900000	I feel at this point in my life, I have the ability to manage my healthcare by myself, including understanding the conditions that I have and my options for treating those various conditions. 
0.583300	I feel fairly unconfident in understanding medial lingo. A lot of the terminology is really hard to take in. Especially if I'm already worried about the procedure or the test results. 
0.883300	I feel that I can get basic health information when needed.  When I go to the doctor, I make sure to have all my questions and concerns written down so I do not forget them.  If there are any issues with medical forms, I am sure to ask a secretary for that information.  
0.816700	Most people in the medical profession talk and explain things to fast for me to fully process the information at the moment. I feel much more comfortable having a family member with me when I talk to someone in the medical profession. Having a family member there helps when getting all the information being presented.
0.666700	I know how to get the information or help I need. I do like outside imput when there are medical decisions to be made. In the past Iâve felt Drâs donât adequately explain issues.
0.816667	Depends on what the doctors says.  Some things are easier to understand than others.  Like if I have a common cold they will tell me to pick up some medicine from the doctor and that is pretty easy. One time they were explaining to me about HPV and that was something I had never heard about before so it was a little more complicated  to process the information 
0.916700	I feel I have the capacity to read, comprehend and understand not just basic but most or all health information I read. I'm fully capable of making appropriate health decisions concerning myself and also my family.
0.822200	In situations like medical conditions and issues, I say never too many questions. I do get discouraged at times when medical professiols make me feel I am being a bother, understandably they deal with so many patients, but as a patient feeling that I think they care and are listening makes a big difference.
0.916667	I have been taking care of my own medical needs as long as I have been an adult.  I don't have any problems reading, understanding, or asking questions about any medical information I receive.  If I am not sure of something, I have no problem asking the Dr to explain things to me.  
0.900000	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information. I rarely have trouble understanding information a doctor or nurse gives me, and when I do I am not afraid to ask questions.
0.883300	I am a reasonably intelligent person, so I feel equal to the task of understanding health information provided to me by my care providers. I also make sure to get clarification of anything I donât understand. I ask lots of questions, and listen intently to what my care providers are telling me. I said that I often give my care providers all the information they need to assess my health, but I do some times hold back information that I find embarrassing. This is not often the case, but I do so on occasion. Also, I am perfectly capable of interpreting the literature provided to me by pharmacists, nurses and doctors, and very rarely have to have someone help me read and interpret. 
0.866667	Very confident as long as the information is in a form I understand,but often is medical jargon that I can not interpet
0.850000	I think that I can understand completely.  I only have little problems understanding.  If I need help I make an appointment to discuss the problems or I talk to my family.
0.822200	I feel like I'm capable of handling tasks at hand when I need too. If I need to ask questions I will, and if I do not understand I will speak up. But I'm sure I can understand them regardless.
0.572200	Doctors are honestly so crabby so I rarely feel like I'm able to process what they're telling me fast enough to even formulate the questions I need to as. Given that, I rarely leave the doctor's office feeling like I understand my health information or what is being recommended for me. For example, I don't understand why I was instructed to get a thyroid test done so I never did it. I didn't understand if it was a light recommendation or if it was really necessary. And in terms of processing, I feel like they're always going too fast for me kind of like I said before. 
0.861111	I think that my medical provider provides a lot of useful information. I rarely have questions, but feel comfortable asking them when I do.
0.766700	I think I have a decent chance at understanding health material as it pertains to my own health and conditions. Occasionally, I find things confusing and I try to get an explanation from the doctor or nurses. However, they sometimes have a difficult time explaining medical terminology in terms that average people can understand. If I am unable to get the answers I need, I often rely on the internet to clear up confusion. Unfortunately, the internet does not always have the correct information about certain health issues and this can cause more issues in the long run. That is why I always try to get good information from the source, like the doctors or nurses themselves. 
0.750000	Always understood the information because I do a lot of research and whatever I do not understand I ask for questions about!
0.461100	Sometimes when I have a condition that send me to hospital I don't feel confident enough to tell the nurse or doctor about it because sometimes I feel that not everything that I'm feeling right now is not related to the condition.
0.661111	I think I can do OK, however I always have someone in the room with me, to remind me to ask questions, or to make sure I understand new medications or new instructions. I never go by myself
0.916700	I feel I have all the to obtain and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions because I know how to ask doctora the right queations to get the information I need and am able to look up any information online that I need to find.
0.900000	Whenever I've visited any health professional in regards to my health I've always had the option to seek out any health information that's necessary. Almost every single time they have always given out a few sheets of paper with a brief explanation of everything as well as always constantly asking me questions if I have any. They always have constantly made me feel as if I have the opportunity to understand and obtain the information with relative ease. 
0.755556	I have the capacity to process basic health information because I use to work in the field. Also my mother worked in the field so I am very familiar with the basics of health topics.
0.883300	I feel like I am very capable in making health decisions.
0.805600	i'm not senile. i just turned 56. now i know how old people feel. i think i'm able to get and understand health info as well as anyone 
0.844400	Given the information and questions asked I feel that I am very capable of understanding basic health information within reason. I may need clarification on various medical jargon used but I will pretty much understand what is being detailed.
0.811111	Overall, I feel like will understand most of what the doctor is saying, or that I understand enough to be able to do further research at home. I do feel that I have time ability to ask follow-up questions as needed.

0.833333	I feel like I understand, what medical tell me. I'm completely honest with my doctors, because I want them to know how to how to help me. If I don't understand something I just ask for help
0.716700	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  However, my personality is such that I rarely speak up for myself and ask questions.  I have the capacity to understand.  However, I am unlikely to ask questions or seek assistance if I am unsure of something.

0.827800	i use the internet to find out more info about hat a doctor has told me. i usually think of questions i leave. 
0.827778	I feel that I can understand what medical conditions I may have and be able to obtain and process information I need to treat it.
0.766700	I am quite literate. I ask physicians questions, instead of being nervous in a medical office and thinking I'll ask someone later. I ask questions about how behaviors could possibly lead to conditions. My mother has worked in the medical field so she helps me. I look up terms online.
0.361100	iTHINK BASED ON THOSE QUESTIONS that I can make a good decision regarding my health. Bring it on!!

0.700000	I can understand the basic information given, but feel like there is a lot that could still use explaining. I usually have to make a list of key phrases that the doctors or nurses say and then google them on my own.

0.450000	The biggest problem is. Most medical professionals makes you feel as if you are taking up their time. Or you are boring them to death. They rush through the explanations. If you have to have an in depth explanation,  it really gets bad. 
0.827800	I am confident that I can understand written information. However, my people skills are below average, and I often don't ask the questions that are in my head because I don't have much confidence in how they will be received. When I do ask questions, I understand the answers, but I often go reading for follow-up information because it is easier to me. 
0.827800	I feel that I am fairly competent when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. I have had a chronic illness since I was a child and spent several of my teenage years very ill.

My mother has also had lupus my entire life and as a child I was educated very well on that and how her condition was treated and I often went to the doctor and hospital with her.
0.916667	I'm competent; I worked for 45 years in law offices and as part of my job often had to read and understand complex documents.

What I don't have is the confidence to speak with doctors about what's bothering me, mainly because none of the ones I've seen so far have been interested, plus I always get the feeling that I'm taking up time that they don't have much of. It's very frustrating.
0.822200	I have access to online information. I can get a second opinion and compare results from multiple websites related to the information I am trying to research. medical terminology is difficult but very specific and usually much easier to search for than more generic terms used in legal or home and car repair. that''s an advantage

Sometimes it is hard to understand what the doctor is trying to tell you because at times it seems like they don't actually listen to all you. Lots of time I'll tell my doctor that have certain symptoms for a certain amount of time then the doctor turns around and says something to make me think he did not listen to me. There are times that he can tell me things and I have no idea what he is talking about because he is using medical terms that I'm not familiar with. Example, I had a full panel blood test and when the results came back in a nurse called to tell me that everything was normal but I had no idea what exactly they are testing for and what it means now that the results were normal. 
0.822200	I beleive that I have a high ability to understand. I am a caregiver to my father who has a lot of health problems and I was once to my mother as well (5 years). I am the go to person for this type of thing in my family.
0.900000	I'm pretty confident with my understanding and basic knowledge of the health information, and I do rely quite a bit on online information, if I didn't understand something even after I ask my doctor, I spend a considerable amount to research more online. It also helps that I have a couple doctors in my family as well as a good friend of mine who is also a doctor (in addition to my own doctor) so I talk to them quite a bit whenever I have questions, although sometimes it can get confusing to get multiple answers from different people at the same time (one may say I need more meds for my cholesterol, another says i don't need that much, etc).
0.883333	I understand info given or have the ability to ask the right questions about anything I don't understand.
0.716700	I feel that I am confident in making health decisions. I know that I can always ask questions of those with a better understanding if something confuses me. If I don't understand something that they have said, I often look their answers up on line so that I can see it worded in normal language. 
0.916667	Very confident in understanding medical terms applicable to any health issues that may be in question for me personally 
0.855556	basic terms i believe i could understand well, what i could not i would ask my doctor, or if it is something trivial i could just look it up online.
0.900000	I understand my medical history and my doctor has taken the necessary time to discuss it with me.  I am a member of a good health group and can also find a lot of information on the website.
0.900000	I am very capable of understanding information and I ask questions if something is not quite clear. I am able to fill out the correct information on specific forms and answer any questions asked.
0.761100	I can always understand basic health information but I have a problem processing it while I am with the doctor or nurse.  It takes me a little time to think of the questions I want to ask and by then, I am already home and it is too late to call.  I feel like doctors and nurses can talk too fast and get you out of the office too quickly at times.
0.855600	Mostly I feel pretty confident. I have had experience with getting a little overwhelmed with information while doctors are talking to you and coming up with questions to ask later
0.844400	I feel that I have the ability to understand basic health information and services. If I am unsure about something I will typically ask the doctor or one of his nurses to clarify, in the event that i don't ask them to explain further I will usually read up on the subject online. I can't recall a time when I have had difficulty understanding medical information. 
0.900000	I feel that I am quite capable of being able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make decisions.  I have had not difficulty up until now and have helped other people find information at times. 
0.755600	"I feel like I have a pretty high capacity to obtain and process health information. Thankfully, I've lived a very healthy life and haven't had all that many interactions with healthcare professiols. But I owe that in part to my interest in health, exercise, and nutrition on a hobby level. I've studied a variety of health topics simply because it interests me; over the years I've read dozens of books on health and nutrition, disease, and pharmacology. I'm a curious person that likes to know how things work, and the human body happens to be one of those things I like to learn about. I read a number of health related blogs, occasiolly listen to health related podcasts, and have even dug in to scientific papers in medical jourls before. So I have much more background information than the typical person - nowhere near that of a medical professiol of course, but I can ""talk the talk"" better than most on a variety of health related topics, I believe. If anything, I'm more confused by the bureaucratic side of things. Insurance plans and coverage, law and tax related issues etc. are about as complex as the human body itself these days. I can't quite get myself as interested to learn more about that, but I know if I needed to research details of my plan or my options, I'm confident I could find and process that information too."

0.705600	I feel like I can understand it pretty well after I do some research. When my doctor did testing for thyroid problems, I went home after the appointment and did a ton of research on it before I ever got the results. I wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting into. When she gave me meds, I went home to find out if there would be any side effects from it.

0.600000	I have no trouble understanding basic health information as it's given to me as long as its in layman terms.  My problem with comprehending health information is when they don't translate test results into basic english and leave it as medical jargon. Also, I find that a lot of the times when it comes to payment it seems like they intentionally leave is as hard to understand as possible, to get you to give up and comply. 
0.827800	I feel I have a high capacity of understanding basic health information and services when provided to me.  My reading comprehension is relatively robust, though I may lack some of the more esoteric health terminology in my vocabulary.  My biggest negative factor is likely related to knowing which questions about my situation are relevant and necessary to ask.

For the most part I usually have no issues understanding what the doctor is telling me and if I do then I ask questions.

0.766700	I think that I have an ok capacity.  I can read just fine but sometimes the medical wording confuses me.  I'll usually do some research once I've gone to see the doctor and been given some medical advice and that usually causes me to get further confused because there is so much information.  I'm also not confident asking questions so, I think that hinders my understanding a lot.  Also, like many others, I fail to tell my doctor everything and I know that it doesn't help my situation and can really hurt my health decisions because by keeping things from my doctor, I'm only hindering my diagnosis.  
0.916700	I have no problems doing anything like that.

0.916667	I feel due to health experiences of other family members I have enough experience and understanding of basic health information and services needed in order for me to make the appropriate health decision for myself.  I also could rely on my husband if needed who is highly knowledgeable in the health field or even my daughter who is in the process of obtaining her RN.
0.588889	I have a basic knowledge of what is discussed with me. Just that sometimes I get nervous and need help understanding what the doctor is discussing. 
0.700000	I feel that I am very able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  What I have trouble with, is when I read the possible side effects or health risks for medication I am prescribed, I can't tell if it's worth the risk or not.  This is bothersome, and there seems to be no clear way to know - it's like you take your chances when you take a drug, that you will not be one of the ones who has a side effect (some side effects are minimal, but others are very serious - like death!).  I wish there was a better way to assess the risk/benefit of taking drugs.  Also, I am very capable when I am well to make decisions regarding my health, but if I was very sick, I would probably want to make sure I had someone with me who was not sick to help me process information correctly...
0.866700	I feel like I have a good handle on my health and health care.  I don't have a medical degree, but I read a lot and have a couple of nurses in the family.

0.916667	I try very hard to keep up with any medical condition I might have or anyone in my family. I will ask as many question I can think of and plus I will always research it on the internet
0.605600	I think I can understand and process a lot of the information given to me by health professionals, but sometimes I need to get an extra opinion to maybe help explain it further to me. I also like to talk things out and I could have missed something so it's always good to have someone else look at the information and try to explain it to you.
0.883333	I feel confident that if I do not understand I ask. I have confidence that my Dr. Always explainsâ in a way I can understand.

It also gives you a better understanding about your health. Your health is a very important factor, so I would do, and ask questions about any and everything I don't understand.
0.866700	I know I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand the information and services that my doctor is providing me because I have experience at work to know the things that doctor explaining to me.

0.672200	I usually don't have issues getting advice or finding help when I need it. The problem lies within the words used. I have to ask a nurse or a doctor often to get clarification on things. I can some times call a hotline to ask but I prefer in person explanations.
0.900000	I feel quite confident in my ability to do so, given past experiences working in the health industry. Being thorough in evaluating my issues helps as well. 
0.638889	I manage my household and have always known the main information  to write on official documents . I pretty mu h remember everyone in th household. I keep important documents also in a file cabinet

0.888900	I'm a pretty sharp guy. I understand what is being told to me. I ask appropriate questions to my situation and understanding. Understanding an issue and acting appropriately on that information are different things, however.

0.655600	I feel my understanding is average. I can understand some things but most need assistance from someone who understands more. I usually prefer an expert in the field to get my info.
0.805556	I have the capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I don't understand something I ask them for more clarification

By the time I leave the doctor I make sure I understand it all, but if I don't I will ask a family member for help. I used to be nervous to ask alot of questions, but now I am not.

0.844400	i have no issues filling anything out. i normally have a good idea whats wrong with me due to healthcare websites like webmd and such. it is typically hard to ask questions to a doctor because they usually are running behind and are in and out of the room in less than 5 minutes so they are not always available to answer all questions if i have any
0.900000	I can easily obtain and understand health information provided to me by medical professiols. Usually the medical condition is explained multiple times by the nurse and doctor. Also, they usually give you educatiol literature to take home and read.

Health decisions are some of the most important decisions we make in our lives, considering these decisions literally do directly effect our life and livelihood. I know there are a lot of people who don't tell their doctors enough information, and don't read enough into the pros and cons of medical decisions for many reasons, but I know that I'm not one of those people.

0.661100	Oftentimes it can be quite overwhelming to take in the whole medical field information. Many terms are used that are very unfamiliar which in turn makes it all the more difficult to understand. While I may feel like asking questions I sometimes do not because I am most afraid that it will become even more overwhelming.

Sometimes, however, I feel rushed and don't think of questions until after I see a doctor or nurse. Other times I feel like I just don't know what questions to ask. I usually just ask the doctor for their opinion of what I should do and try to trust what I'm told. 
0.822200	I am rather confident that I have the ability to do so. There are some questions I'm unsure about, specifically questions that might pertain to past injuries sustained in sports and that could be affecting me at the time. I don't have any medical school background but I make sure to ask as many questions as necessary to satisfy my curiosity about my medical issues almost every time I go to be seen by a health professional.

0.744400	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information to a great extent. I am a nurse, so a lot of medical things I understand. But even being a health professional myself, I find some of the information is hard to understand, and I realize working as a nurse a lot of it is even harder for someone who has no medical background. 
0.866700	I feel very confident in my ability. Especially nowadays, when you can google and read more about any topic, I am sure that I could understand any medical information and make solid decisions. I might feel a little pressured in an appointment where the medical professional didn't have a lot of time to spend with me, but I would just go home and learn more about the topic through research, and call back for more info if necessary. I also have a great, experienced family who would help me understand anything I had questions about.

0.744400	Although medical jargon can be difficult to understand I feel pretty confident in filling out any medical forms necessary.  My reading comprehension is very high so I feel confident that even if there's terms or conditions I don't understand I can usually figure out the meaning by reading the context of the sentence.  Also, if I need to I can do research on my own and usually do concerning any symptoms I display.

0.916700	I feel like I am fully capable of making appropriate health decisions.

0.811111	I feel like I am able to understand what is going on. If not I ask questions so that I know what is going on.
0.838900	I think I pretty much have a good handle on understanding things, as well as seeking out reliable sources for information. As an example, when I was diagnosed as being BRCA1+, the oncologist said to me something like she didn't think she could tell me anything I didn't already know.
0.738900	I feel like I have a good capacity to understand health information, since I am going into a health field. I sometimes find it difficult to tell doctors everything I planned to

0.883300	I feel that I have the capacity to take care of most of my health related stuff on my own but I do wish that doctors would be more precise and explain a lot more about the medication they give me.

I say this because altho' I keep a list of points to cover, those in the healthcare industry mean well, yet they are time-strapped, the environment is stressed, focus is not always laser-fine, thus things get missed, re-directed, misinterpreted, etc.  Teamwork makes the dream work, so I try, they try, we try, Pobody's Nerfect and 100% is not feasible.  I end up making additional appointments, physical concerns need to be re-evaluated, health problems sometimes exacerbate, co-payments multiply, etc.  Probable solutions.. ..processes re-investigated i.e. policy/procedure/protocol, but takes time, $$$, buy-in $ & who honestly has that?!?

The problem is when doctors are more concerned with a ""treat and street"" philosophy merely going through the motions to check off boxes for insurance companies than actually LISTENING to patients and taking the time to ask the questions that need to be answered in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  Patients often do not know that a symptom is just that so when a doctor fails to asks the right questions there will likely not be an accurate diagnosis.  Another issue is when a doctor blatantly ignores my questions.  How many ways to I have to ask the most basic question of what does this diagnosis mean?  More often than not it's just easier to go home and search webmd or the Mayo Clinic website.  Problem with that is I generally end up with even more unanswered questions.  Ultimately I am quite capable of understanding information when it is provided and if my questions are answered with more than a couple of words.

I often find that the doctor is telling me information and I am just nodding and saying ""ok"" because I am not sure what other information I might need to know in order to make the proper decisions."
0.916667	For the most part I think I get a clear understanding of the information given to me from doctors.

I know that with the internet I can always look up whatever I can't /don't understand for clarity.
0.655556	I have family who would help me or I will research it myself I cant relly talk to my doctors because they are so ready to go to the next person not really worrying about what's wrong with you

0.866700	I feel that all the information is available.  Most important is to be completely honest with the doctor and do proper research.  Googling an answer is not the best way to get information.  Proper research into peer reviewed papers from the top of each prospective field is necessary.  This is not to discount the information that is obtainable by each doctor.  These professionals know more about your individual circumstances than anyone.  It is important to ask for and get information from many different resources.  So, in total I would say that I have a good understanding, am able to process and am able to access the necessary information to better inform and care for my needs.

Although very dangerous, this can be solved by trusting the professionals with all of the relevant information.

0.855600	I feel confident, but most likely because I haven't had to deal with any major health issues yet. I find that the internet is a very vast source of information, that can supplement a medical professional's advice in terms of what to do regarding treatment or diagnosis. I feel as though I have ample access, as well as everybody else living in the modern era, to access vast wells of knowledge whether it be via the internet, through word of mouth, or through the expansive network of medical institutions which seem to be always open. Even if you can't get an appointment right away, there seems to always be alternate options.

I understand what they are looking for when they ask me questions and I'm able to be a good patient as far as my volunteering information.

I don't tend to ask questions at the end of the encounter, but I am able to look up information online and understand it well.

0.844400	I studied Medical Office Technology in college which included classes in medical terminology. I had to learn a lot about different medical procedures and afflictions. I've always read about my level, and I read rather fast. I know I can understand what I read. If I can't, I know how to get online and look up what I need. I also know a few medical personnel I can call and ask to explain something to me.
0.916700	Most times when I am given medical information related to my conditions or the prescriptions that I may have to take I usually have a good understanding of what I am told.

0.794400	To a good extent. Sometimes the questions on the forms are a bit confusing and it's hard to put down an answer.  They are also repetitive. I am able to ask the doctor questions about information given to me, but often questions do not come up until after the visit. 
0.794400	I feel like overall I can articulate my needs and get the help I need/ understand the basics of the medical care I receive.  I do more often than not withhold some information from my doctor because I didn't want to get a lecture. For example, i am on the keto diet,  which has done wonders for my labs,  weight, etc. Yet when i mention it all I get is how bad it is... It's really frustrating. So i feel like the communication is not there and i often feel rushed and just put to the side in terms of the concerns I have. I'm very information literate and able to understand studies and research results,  so I'm usually mostly put of by my physician's ibility to consider other options or opinions. 
0.833300	I have had several minor and a major surgery. Before I make any decision I make sure the doctor or nurse explain in basic language what I need to know. I will also take notes of what I am being told. I will go online and do some research and after that discuss it with my doctor. When filling out paperwork if I do not understand something I will ask questions until I understand.

0.844400	I believe that I can understand and process basic health information to make my health decisions.  I tend to not ask enough questions.  I tend to depend on internet research to fill in the blanks.

0.783300	i have no problem making health decisions for myself.  I was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma 2 years ago.  It is still hard to comprehend sometimes the magnitude of future treatments and what is required.  The doctor never discussed long term percentages with me and i am afraid to ask.

Pharmaceutical information can be trickier, but it and other complicated medical information which is harder to understand can also be ""googled"" nowadays, which I have confidence in."
0.777800	I feel that I mostly understand. But, medical issues are pretty complex, and I am not a Dr or a nurse, so I did have to ask questions and consult the internet.
0.788889	Sometime I might not understand the professional terms that Doctor's or Nurses use, so I ask if they would get me a simple explanation.
0.677800	I feel like I can understand a lot of things and that I have gotten better at asking questions. However, I am bad at asking questions when they are about a new topic.

0.916667	I feel very confident as I can read, write and understand the English language quite well.  Sometimes medical talk can get very complicated with words we don't understand.  That's when you obviously ask questions to whoever is in front of you.

0.883300	I definitely think I can make the proper decisions for myself in regards to my health.
0.655556	i would be okay reading and ovtaining medical imformation on my own even if I had to read it more then one time to understand what I had just read
0.744444	I feel if I try hard enough then I have the capacity to process what is being explained to me. As far as basic health information I can pick up on that. 
0.900000	I feel that I have the capacity to process and understand basic health information. I choose medical providers that are good at communicating things to me and do not get mad or annoyed when I ask questions. I feel that if I am paying a doctor for medical care, they should be happy to answer my questions.
0.638889	I believe I have some capability ro do so. I understand the information. If I am not sure I will proceed to ask for help by a professional.
0.650000	I think that when you are in a position to have face to face time with a doctor or nurse, you are usually not thinking clearly and things go rather quickly and then when you can't think of what you want to ask right that minute they leave and as soon as you are home you start thinking of questions you should have asked. You can alway call and wait for them to get back to you but that always seems like you are bothering them. The internet is usually a good source to do you your own research to get a better understanding of whats going on, assuming you fact check and don't just believe something because some random person said it was true.
0.688889	I feel that obtaining and processing health information isn't too difficult. Although, sometimes there might be some parts or terms that I might not understand. And if I don't, I'd ask a doctor if possible or look it up online. 
0.900000	I feel that  can understand what the doctor says to me about my condition what ever it is.Even if it may be something serious
0.777800	If it came to a serious decision I could definitely ask questions to make a determination.  I understand basics of what doctors are saying and mostly I just wait for results from tests in order to determine what more information I need. 
0.761111	I feel like I can make an informed decision. Depending on what I am dealing with, I feel that I can consult others in person, online, etc. and do research until I am satisfied with my decision.
0.805600	I feel like I can obtain and process basic health information effectively. It's only when there is a complication that I don't always get the information I need or follow up material to make an informed decision. Or sometimes I don't think of  question till long after I have left the doctor's office.
0.561100	I feel like I do understand but would rather get a second opinion. I'm not a doctor or anywhere near that field. I'd like to be equipped with the right information.
0.777778	I understand what i read to my knowing i do know that i would have a health problem because its my body
0.644400	I feel like I do.  I just don't understand some of the terms the doctors/nurses use.  I understand most of what they are saying. It when you are at the doctor you're (at least I am) a little scared so your brain doesn't process like normal. 
0.916700	I feel that I am extremely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
0.688889	I like this good health and a happy family good friend talk to doctors and family members about your health
0.794400	When dealing with health information and services, it's unlikely for an individual to be familiar with all the medical terminology. As such, it's important to ask the appropriate questions and aid if they're confused or questioning the instructions. Failure to do so can lead to errors, which will waste time and money for all involved.

0.605556	I feel if they ask the right questions that are simple for people to understand it should be easy to understand

I have some trouble filling out forms. I think my capacity to understand basic health information is good, but it could be better. 
0.794400	I feel ok in most instances when it comes to my health and any health related questions I may have.  Generally I ask the upfront questions of my medical care people but then I also rely on research i do myself to fill out that information when I have questions.  It's sometimes frustrating having to wait on test results and, generally, I feel,that's where the communication breaks down between patient & doctor.  Every time I ask 'When will X be ready?'  I get the answer that goes from tomorrow to next week with no definitive time line and that is incredibly frustrating to me.

Once I fully process what I need, I then make the changes needed to feel better and healthier.

0.888889	When something is wrong health wise with me, I make it a point to ensure I have all the questions I need answered. I want to understand the issue, the symptoms, and how to correct the problem. I tend to ask a lot of questions to ensure I understand the problem and can effectively explain the problem to someone else if need be. I want specifics and transparency when speaking with my doctor which is what I provide in exchange as keeping important health details can limit the information provided by my doctor. 
0.655600	sometimes it gets tough to cooperate when ready books before going to bed. I need lots of light and a activity around me.
0.916667	I have no problem with understanding health information and services so that I will be able to make decisions regarding my health or that of others who might need that.

0.866700	"I understand the basics usually pertaining to myself. I had a recent total hysterectomy and it was hard to pull all the information together in terms of estrogen replacement. It's been a year and I am still trying to ascertain the estrogen at my age going away and the swelling and pain I am having. Trying lyrica but that is causing weight gain. Hard to get professionals to see me as not fat but swollen! I ask questions likely better than most because I have a child who has Cerebral Palsy with 2 VP Shunts for hydrocephalus who requires frequent shunt revisions. This has taught me to speak up since he cannot talk. I have to ask all questions and think all the time about what could be ""up."" I am not afraid to ask any question and when I do meet a stubborn provider for him I am now quick to tell them I will no longer need their services. Then I find another. For me, I usually am not as assertive."

0.461100	I feel like I do have the capacity to understand. I do feel however that health practitioners don't assess me on an individual level. I have a long history of being medically different,  certain tests and advice are not applicable to me. I have taken medicine that has opposite side effects on me not disclosed on the medicine brochure. Doctors usually don't believe the side effects I explain to have. 
0.883300	I feel that I am willing to admit when I need help understanding something from my doctor.  If I am unsure of what is being discussed, read, or asked about, I will seek out a source to clarify my confusion.
0.761100	Yes, I do pretty well with this normally. If I need a little bit of help I have doctor friends I will ask for their input sometimes. However, that is usually not the case and I end up doing things on my own.
0.850000	Normally, I have no problem understanding what they are telling me.  Occasiolly, when I encounter someone who doesn't break down medical lingo into easier terms, I do have trouble but don't have any problem asking for clarification.  
0.638889	It very hard communicating health issues but I find a way to do it because the health service personnel makes it easy for me sometimes 
0.916700	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do so. I can easily read and understand most medical literature and I know what information to seek out and what questions to ask. I also feel confident about my ability to conduct independent research online or anywhere else.
0.800000	I feel as if I'm smart enough to understand what is being told to me, but the act of being at the doctor is emotional and that interferes with my ability to understand or make rational decisions. 
0.650000	I beliebe I have a very high understanding and capacity to get these things done on my own. It is very rare that I find myself asing for help in these situations.

0.805600	I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions but i do run everything y my wife.  She has been an Operating room nurse for over 15 years and extremely well versed in the medical field.  I defer to her knowledge when it comes to medical knowledge.
0.844400	I think that I have a good awareness of my body, and how it usually functions.  Therefore I feel confident in my abilities to find out when something is off.  If they use medical language that I have not heard of, or is confusing to me, I have the cognitive capacity to ask for clarification.  I've never left an office visit feeling lost or confused due to medical jargon.
0.750000	Everything I understand well for which I do not need help always explain me well I always try to have the doctor give me all the details regarding my health and if I am sick to explain myself well and that well the instructions to take the medicine
0.916667	I understand everything that is explained to me. I usually do not need further explanation. I do, however, ask a lot of questions when it comes to my daughter. I like to know what is going on with her health at all times and I make sure I understand what the doctor(s) tell me.

0.777800	I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate heath decisions. 
0.705600	I feel semi-confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services. I do find difficulty when attempting to get answers from health professiols. I generally notice that health professiols automatically assume that people have a general understanding of all aspects regarding health but I don't believe this is the case. This makes decision making more difficult. 
0.883300	I can generally understand the information given to me by my physician.  Whenever I am not sure, I will ask him or his nurse to explain it in laymen's terms.  I usually do  research on my own as well, and get a second opinion on methods of treatment I am not sure of.

0.850000	Well I'd rather know than not know so I'm not afraid of asking hard questions and will press if I'm not getting answers that I fully trust or think they might be holding back.  I also think I'm quite capable of understanding my options when explained to me properly as well as of course being able to research my options myself.  All in all I feel quite capable that most of the time I can make good decisions about my health.
0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand and make my own decisions about health and basic services. I grew up in a family that my mother was a X-ray tech.  She talked and explain a lot about medical things.

Furthermore I don't have any problems interacting with my doctors and nurses and pressing for more information.
0.916700	I have excellent knowledge of the healthcare field.  I am the person to go to when you need help understanding anything involving health.  I am not a Dr. or nurse. 
0.850000	I am college educated and competent, and have the mental capacity to take care of any health issues that come my way in the near future.
0.761100	I believe I am knowledgeable enough to understand most basic information. However, I do tend to ask a lot of questions just to make sure I get everything right. Especially when it comes to your health, it is always good to get more information and clarification.

I have no mental deficits and have some previous experience working in the healthcare field. I feel like I understand basic health information and services quite well.
0.805600	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information and use this to make health decisions.

0.866700	I am very well aware of specific medical terms and conditions due too my education and my own persol knowledge. I believe it is ignorant too not be able to properly assess yourself and have little knowledge of your health.
0.672222	I mostly do, I'm just not good at asking doctors questions or speaking up about my conditions. It's hard to talk to people in positions of authority, and sometimes it feels like they don't listen when I do talk. I can generally fill out forms on my own without needing help, unless they contain a lot of complicated jargon.
0.916667	I feel very confident to ask, answer or read about any information concerning my health.  I have dealt with this on many occasions & have never had any problems understanding or making myself understood.
0.888900	The doctors I see always explain my condition and my options really well. Whenever I ask questions I feel like they go above and beyond on telling me everything they know to help me understand my illness or whatever I am seeing them for. I also have access to the internet; while not a reliable method for diagnosis, it does have extra information available about practically every illness and condition if I wish to learn more.

It's sad to say but it's true. So it can be difficult and I can require extra explaining when something is wrong with me.
0.866700	I believe that I have sufficient mental capacity to understand and process health information and services. Although I may not understand some of the jargon, I am very good at asking follow-up questions to ascertain the missing pieces of the puzzle. When I have symptoms, I do not withhold information because I do not want the doctor to misdiagnose or miss the diagnosis.
0.777778	I feel that I am able to understand the information I am given by doctors. I read over any information I would like to know more about. If there is anything more I need to know, I ask questions.
0.761100	i have a high capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. i have been visiting medical professiols for decades and have always asked questions whenever the initial explations needed more clarifications. i have no issues in doing so until i can understand what is going on.
0.811100	I really don't have much of a difficulty understanding health information.  I work as a medical technologist at a primary care hospital and since I don't know everything about health I have people around me like doctors nurses and other health professionals that can help me understand what I don't.
0.750000	I am very knowledgeable about my health and question my doctors on regular basis.  I keep up to date on side effects of medications I use or may use in the future.  
0.672222	I try to ask all the question to the doctor if I forget something I'll call them up when I think of something else I should of ask .
0.572200	I think i can understand it somewhat however somwtimes whe the doctor is talking to me i really do not know what they are saying or taking about 
0.733300	I am a pretty intelligent individual, so I think I have a higher comprehension than most. With that being said, I know when I go over my insurance plan and that sort of paperwork, I have a hard time understanding what all of it means. I never took any sort of secondary schooling in the medical field, so some of the terminology is beyond me.
0.755600	I don't even understand that statement.  Why do doctors go to school for 10 years to learn all this jargon and I'm supposed to understand it with nothing
0.916700	I think I have enough basic medical knowledge to handle most basic health information I am given, and I know enough to know when I need to ask questions  to make sure I completely understand the ramifications of any new health information
0.844400	I think I am very literate in this regard. I am able to almost always able to locate the proper information online to fill in any gaps in my knowledge. 
0.788900	I do a lot of research online usually before I see the doctor. I am sensible about it though and just use the information so when I talk to the doctor I know what they are talking about usually. I think medicine is very interesting but I do have an anxiety disorder that prevents me from seeking all the proper care I need. I generally understand what I am told and if I don't I usually ask or research it later. 
0.616700	i feel like i usually understand the main points but not always the details or the reasoning behind what they are telling may. I dont understand enough to really form my own opinions on things, so i just do what the doctor says and hope it is what is best.
0.888900	It's really not me... it's the doctors. I'm sure you've seen that they have 20min, 15min, even 10min appointments... they don't give you enough time to process what they say, to allow you to form questions.

0.916667	I am fully competent to understand and fill out forms. I understand health info as I took some courses in school to understand body structure and function. 
0.811100	I usually have all the questions I want to ask read. However I process methodically and they process you so fast,I often leave with all my questions answered but more crop up just a few minutes later.
0.861100	I feel that I am reasonably able to comprehend and obtain the basic information to make appropriate decisions regarding my health.
0.816667	I work in the Healthcare field, so i do understand much of the medical terminologies. If i do need some clarification, i have plenty of  people who can help, if the Dr  is not able.
0.783333	I feel like I have general knowledge to understand medical situations and if I dont I should be able to ask someone knowledgable about the situation.
0.588889	I think i can with about maybe some or have & need most likely help with the rest. I can get some info but the rest is somewhat confusing and hard to get
0.888889	I feel very confident when I ask questions to my doctor or nurse. I generally take good care of the health.
0.616700	IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO ASK WHEN I GO TO MY DOCTOR, EVEN WHEN I WRITE IT DOWN.  MY DOCTOR DOES NOT SEEM TO WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH ME. JUST LOOKS AT HER COMPUTER THE WHOLE TIME.  I FEEL LIKE I AM BOTHERING HER. WHATEVER MY PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE, SHE WILL GIVE ME A PILL FOR IT.
0.883300	I feel confident in getting needed information and queries from health care providers. Even the worst healthcare professional would have more knowledge than the average layperson. I have also on occasion researched medication, disease process, and complications online. I have found online information to be easier to understand and often explains the medical professional's explanation. The combination of reputable information sources will often answer any questions and clear any anxieties. 
0.700000	I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information; however, I have difficulty understanding the technical terms and procedures.
0.644400	Yes, If I don't understand I ask as many questions as needed till I do understand. I am very concerned about my health.
0.633333	I really do not, it's usually above my head.  Sometimes, the doctors explanation is clear while other times is over my head. Alot of times u am just trying to get it off the office so I disregard a lot of the information they are telling me. Other times when it's very serious, I try to get all the information that i can or that is available. At those times it is important to get all the info I can.
0.611100	I feel that I'm a smart person.  My mind is sharp but at the same time doctors and nurses are sometimes so vague and trying to just wrap up the appointment so they can get their money that I just go along with it
0.838889	I feel I have a lot of capacity, but prefer for them to ask me if I really understand terms and to clarify what's going on.
0.883333	there are information that I only know so I always try to answer all questions that is needed so the doctor or nurse can help me to stay healthily 
0.722200	I feel fairly confident that I understand most basic health information. I don't always remember everything so I like to have things written down so there is no confusion.
0.494400	I feel like if I asked more questions and did more research I would be better informed but I put off both as]king questions and doing research for later and then never actually do it, so ivery often don't know the proper info about the prescription meds I'm taking and what I can't and can't take with them.I know the info is all out there but I just get too flustered to do anything about it. 
0.916700	Whenever I speak to a medical practitioner, I generally take notes. In between visits, should a question come up, I write it down and keep it in my medical notebook so that I remember to ask. I am not afraid to ask questions regarding my health, but I feel that sometimes doctors or nurses are so overwhelmed by their duties that they don't give much, or very clear, information. I have no issues retaining the information, it just needs to be given.
0.705600	I think that I am able answer any and all questions but I know I need assistance in understanding some things mostly because I don't know the technical terms but I know what is being spoken about in common English.
0.777778	If it's a easy diagnosis thats okay but when it requires that i need surgery this is where I pump on the brakes,I'll agree to certain procedures but others I literally scared to death so I told them Im not signing any forms to have any procedure I dont know anything about so filling out forms having things explained to me as simple as can be is worthwhile

0.883333	I can comprehend and understand information for the most part, but I would ask questions for things just for clarification.
0.588900	I feel that my education which included anatomy, first aid, and a health course perhaps puts me on a slightly higher pedestal than an average person. I know a fair bit of terminology, symptoms, solutions, and of how the body works, but I am by no means an expert. The bureaucratic portion of the forms needed at doctor's offices were done by my guardian until I was 19. Because of this I feel that I have had very little time exposed to them, and as such need extra help usually on one or two sections, never the whole thing however. I feel it is harder to obtain than to process and understand as many doctors are very busy.
0.705556	I have a lot of knowledge on how to read it because i research it. I have people in my family that are nurses.
0.855600	I have sufficient knowledge and reading comprehension skills to understand basic medical information. I've also had fairly extensive experience with care issues of family members over many years, so I've gleaned a fair amount of basic medical knowledge.

0.794400	I think in a serious medical situation we are all a bit nervous and anxious, I always go with my parents so I can listen and ask questions and later explain if necessary.  When I go to the doctor I am usually alone and I find it difficult getting the doctor to listen to me, to actually hear what I am saying.

0.866700	I feel I have a large capacity to deal with basic health information. Although I have never studied medicine, I follow developments in the field and enjoy reading professional journals. Though much of it goes over my head I feel I have a good understanding of medical conditions and possible treatments. I especially like to go to the doctor knowing in advance what he may say. Allows for a more detailed discussion.

0.888900	I can understand whatever the doctor tells me, whether spoken or written, If I need to I can research further online later. But a lot of that depends on the doctor too, some doctors explain things well, others just kind of assume you already know.
0.916700	At one time, years ago, I studied biology, Latin and Greek. If I find my understanding of a document or information is uncertain, I look it up. The internet can be a good resource for information. So is a library.

I will happily call my health care provider and ask a nurse or email my physician.
0.822200	Even if I don't initially understand all the information, I try to ask questions to help me understand further. I also have a close family member who is a registered nurse who has helped me at times. I try to use good resources on the internet for information.
0.838900	I believe that I have a pretty good handle on how to handle information about information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. That being said, I've never had a serious medical condition to have to deal with.  Most things that I have ever been to a doctor for have been fairly innocuous.  I'm sure if there was a major life threatening illness or something requiring an invasive surgery I would have more questions.
0.761111	I understand basic health information and the process. When I go to the doctors office I understand the reasoning behind my visits. When I pick up my perscription from the pharmacy I understand

0.866667	I believe I generally am capable of understanding the doctors that I have when they reference my conditions, the care of those conditions, and the medicine that they require me to take. I feel I understand to a pretty high degree what is going on. 
0.800000	I feel that I am well informed about medical situations that I am in or my children are in. Often I will research information before going to the doctor so that I have an idea about what we will be discussing. Usually, if I am struggling to wrap my mind around what is going on I will ask questions until i fully understand so that I can care for myself or for my child in the best possible way.
0.638900	I feel somewhat confident in my ability to obtain information, however, processing and understanding it can be difficult. Oftentimes, I like to have someone with me (e.g., my husband) at my appointments with me to make sure I am properly taking in everything I need to know. When I am on my own, I have left appointments several times realizing I don't fully remember everything or perhaps have forgotten to ask certain questions.
0.816700	I think I do. I worked as a pharmacy tech for a while, so I had to know what I was doing for basic health information. It helps me make any choices I need to make as far as health concerns go.
0.916667	I'm not an old maid. I am of sound mind, capable of making my own decisions. My comprehensive skills are still sharp. When the doctor explain instructions, I interpret them well without assistance.
0.400000	I really never understand most of what the doctor is saying about my condition. I feel really stupid for asking questions about it because when I do ask questions I get the vibe that the doctors think I'm stupid. I sometimes will ask a few questions but by the end I am shaking my head like I fully understand when actually I have no clue. 
0.733300	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information, my main issue is when doctors or nurses use medical school grade vocab and I have no idea how to even spell what they said to look it up myself. Or they will push a certain product or treatment (ie the HPV Vaccine) when I do not want it.
0.794400	I asked the doctor the questions that trouble me and he explains my concerns very well and when I go home I do a little research of my own as well.
0.850000	I usually feel like I can get the information I need, but I oiften worry that I don't have the expertise to understand all of it and get all the answers to questions I need.

0.883300	My father was an M.D. as was my maternal grandfather. I was raised to become an M.D. I chose physics. Regardless, I grew up surrounded by medical discussions and spend a great deal of time with health-care professionals and as a consequence am extremely comfortable with them, asking them questions, and challenging them. Obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information to make appropriate health choices is something I'm very comfortable with.
0.866667	I always ask questions until I'm confident that everything has been explained to me, and I understand everything.

Also, I can ask my doctor if I can record information so that I can listen to it again in case I miss something. 
0.866700	I think I am good at comprehending most information needed to make health decisions. If not, I have no problems asking for help. I can also research the information online.
0.544444	I believe I understand what information I'm going over when I have asked someone and had them simplify what it is in less medically related vocabulary.
0.855600	I usually follow what they're saying. If I know in advance I'll write my questions down. A lot of the time if I don't do that I'll have additional questions later.

0.805600	When it comes to a basic understanding I do have the capacity. I have no problem with this at all. All I need to do is slow down while reading and it becomes evident. There are times when medical terms are used which I do not understand but I will ask for a clarification so that I do understand.
0.800000	To ask more questions about test that doctors take while at the hospital and ask about treatment and side effects on medicine
0.650000	I believe that I have the capacity to process the basic information that a doctor or a healthcare professional tells me. I do not think a doctor would just leave you blindly, they would help you understand what is going on. And even if they do not give me all of the information I will still have a decent understanding of what is happening to me. I am no where near educated as a doctor is but I have taken quite a few medical classes, such as medical terminology so I have at least a basic understanding of what I would need to know when a doctor is breaking the information down to me.

0.883333	If I have a medical condition for example a  broken arm, I pretty much know everything that's going on the medical stand point. The paper work is usually filled out easily.
0.627778	I feel I have a small degree to the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When I am given information, I still feel like I have to log on the internet and do further research. I usually look up extra information so that I can understand exactly what I have and what steps are need to be taken. I also go back to my document on my clinic's website so I can grab information that may be important to my research. If I panic, I look up forums so I can get some comfort from patients like me. 
0.638900	getting the information is reasonably easy, once you are able to contact your provider, thats the biggest headache that takes the longest, Actually speaking to a doctor or nurse is difficult and it time consuming.

I try to take the time to think of all symptoms, instances and relevant information.

Although there are a very few times that I don't understand but I seek help, usually at the front desk of the doctors office and they explain to me in detail. It is very important to me that I understand all the medical papers about my health because I want to make sure I take the correct measures in case of an illness. I would not want to misunderstand and later on deal with a worse health issue. I would rather ask even if it means asking a lot of questions.
0.616700	I'm often times too shy to ask for help or further explation. However, I also feel that doctors and nurses have a tendency to rush things. I can barely even get my questions in because they just breeze through the appointment like they don't really want to be there or they have other things to be doing.

0.866700	I feel I can handle basic health information between me and my caregiver or doctor.  What can be confusing is dealing with actual health insurance forms and questions.

Between me and my doctor, if I don't understand something, I always ask for clarifications.

It's been nearly 6 years since my last visit, and I was given so many forms and documents to fill out, with some ambiguous questions that could mean this-or-that and I didn't want to make a mistake. It was slightly difficult, and kind of nerve-wrecking.
0.777800	I feel that I am intelligent enough to understand enough about health information and services needed to make decisions related to my health. It is things like health insurance that I struggle understanding completely.

0.794444	I am an RN (disabled ), and have no trouble understanding  medical information  due to my training and experience.

0.672200	I'm pretty bright and understand a lot, but a lot of times my doctors or nurses don't really explain things to me in detail about my conditions, lab reports, etc. I also forget to ask questions or clarify things when I am there sometimes, because I tend to get nervous. They're always rushing too so it's not like you get a ton of time.
0.883333	I'm very capable when it comes to health information and services. i often ask questions and look up information in books and online.

0.511100	I think I feel more comfortable if I have help from someone else when going over these things regarding the process of obtaining and carrying out various things concerning health care. I understand the basics and how they relate to me personally, but anything beyond that I usually ask my mother since she has dealt with these types of things for her entire life and she is very knowledgeable about them.

0.794400	I think I have this capacity to a high degree. At least on par with others. I also don't hesitate to ask health professiols to explain anything that I don't understand.
0.633300	While I am reasonably confident in my abilities to understand, there are times when doctors and health care professionals speak with too much complicated jargon. It is helpful to have someone with me to ask the questions that I don't even know I should be asking.

If at any given time I don't understand I will try to ask question or research it afterwards. For myself personally, I don't have any issue.

0.772200	I think every time you try to obtain medical information in a clear and understandable manner, it is a challenge. I ask a lot of questions, but I seldom get the straight answers I desire and feel I deserve.

0.844400	I feel that I have an above-average understanding of much health-related documentation.

I am able to make other important decisions in my life so I feel I am totally capable of making health decisions. 
0.733333	If I have questions about any health concerns it is easy for me to ask someone for clarification. I would either ask my doctor or legal guardian for help if need be.
0.794444	I feel I am capable if the doctor or nurse takes the time to explain in detail; but too many rush thru the appointment and get impatient with numerous questions.
0.538889	You have the right to know the status of your health and make decisions regarding care. You have the right to ask what your diagnosis is and for second opinions. 
0.522222	i have a hard time understanding most forms that have anmything to do with doctors nurses and pharmacies so about 40

0.505600	I have problems thinking of a Way to ask the doctor what I need to know. I have a hard time ezpressi g myself in that manner. I also think doctors give me information to quickly for me to process it. I feel rushed when I'm with a doctor and I don't think the exlain everything thouroghly.

0.855600	I can explain what the problem is. I can listen to the answers and I usually understand them. Sometimes I ask additiol questions to clarify something.
0.633333	I am under the care of 2 to 3 doctors at any given time. At times I feel like I am being rushed and things aren't explained to me the way I need. I can fill out forms, but it seems they aren't read by the doctor. When given a diagnosis, I have to do the research to find out exactly what it means. I can say that my PCP does a better job than my other doctors in taking time to listen to me. I recently had a very bad experience with a surgeon and staff at a prominent hospital/medical facility all over forms. No one would really help me. They just passed me around to different people. I felt discarded.
0.916667	I feel very capableof navigating the medical community. I am an RN. My major issue is remembering to ask when I am actually with the doctor. However, I do believe it is getting more and more complicated with The ACA.

0.794444	I feel as though I obtain information really well and I understand it to a certain extent. If I need more information about whatever may be going on the I would tend to ask questions 
0.838900	I feel very capable of understanding health information.  I struggle sometimes when I feel rushed asking all the questions I need to get all the information I need.  Often I think of questions  after I have left a doctor's office that I forgot to ask.  I try to make lists when I know I have an upcoming appointment.
0.794444	I'm not sure why this is an issue. I have no problems asking questions and seeking direction if I don't understand something. 
0.688900	I feel completely confident for the questions that I answered about my capacity to obtain,process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions as I am well educated and know my rights and also I can gather more information from outside sources to enhance my knowledge.I always interact with people to understand on various health information related information to gather more knowledge.I am quite aware of mine and my family health issues.

0.788900	I have a pretty average capacity to obtain and understand health information. I see a pulmonologist and a regular doctor regularly and always have questions that usually either get answered or I get referred to the appropriate doctor. There are a few conditions I have that I have a hard time explaining and getting an explation about from my doctors. Why it sometimes feels like my heart is beating harder than it is, for example.
0.544400	Oftentimes information concerning my health can get a bit complex, and I occasiolly need aid from a professiol health professiol to decipher certain things regarding the information.
0.566667	it hard to under stand the docter and medecne how to take then and went to take it what time of the day or nigth time
0.705600	I think I have a basic knowledge of what is required by a layperson to evaluate, and determine if someone needs to seek medical attention.  I have two small children and would take them to the doctor or call if I thought one of them was in need of seeing a doctor.  While I do not have medical training, I can tell when someone is sick.
0.916667	I have no problem reading and understanding medical information given to me,  both written information and verbal. 
0.883333	I believe I am capable of tracking down the information I need. I can also google or ask my Dr. or nurse if I nerd help.
0.827778	I feel I have a pretty good understanding. There have been occasions where I needed assistance to understand.
0.722200	I feel that I get the information that I need to take care of myself. I sometimes do not feel that I can tell everything that is wrong with me as I feel sometimes that dr are judging me and I get shy about bringing things up to them.
0.850000	My wife has medical background and I read alot. This allow me to understand better. I am very good with using a computer to understand what is provided to me.
0.916667	I feel I have the maximum capacity to understand basic health information and services. I have been to the doctor pretty regularly and my kids have too so I'm pretty informed on a lot of healthcare information.
0.872222	I understand everything that's said to me at times they break it down to me for an clear understanding..
0.861111	I ask questions till I get it all, no matter how long it takes, I feel very confident, before anything is done
0.816700	I feel fully capable of taking charge of my own health and that the current system gives me, as a native speaker and well-educated person, what I need
0.811100	I think I have the capacity to understand my doctors information and to read about it online. But I think in the moment at a doctor's appointment I forget to tell them everything and so I worry they do not get the whole story. I also think that appointments themselves are expensive and I don't have the means to go to a doctor or get the tests I want done. I also think that health insurance policies are written in a confusing way where it limits what I do because I am not entirely sure what I can do. This narrows my health decisions a great amount.
0.866700	I have very good nurses and doctors that are always willing to help and answer any questions. Our insurance also provides us with a nurses hotline if we need to ask any questions. When I fill prescriptions the pharmacists are always very helpful and make sure I understand everything. I also have several nurse friends that are always willing to answer any questions. 
0.883300	I think I am fully capable of understanding and obtaining my basic health information. I am also fully capable of making decisions about treatment for any health problem.

0.916667	I have no problems completing any type of medical or other forms of any kind.  I am able to understand all questions asked of me.
0.561100	I feel like I'm literate and competent enough to understand things, but I often lack sufficient information because I have too little time face-to-face with a doctor, nurse, or tech.  I feel rushed along and don't feel like it's ok  to ask many questions or to provide very detailed information.
0.833300	I work in the health care field and Iâve had 9 surgeries so I have a pretty good understanding of what medical terminology means and I know how to obtain my information and my records.
0.916700	I have a complete ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information 
0.822200	I started to get my own medical records because I wasn't getting all of the information that they were writing about me. So it helped me understand what they were thinking of me, and what I needed to do to get them to understand. I do have to google a lot of the wording on copies of MRIs because no one really tells me what came up on the scans.
0.627800	I'm not confident at all that I obtain what I need to. A lot of the blame lies with me I guess. I am a nervous person, and I usually want to get away from people ( especially medical people) fast. If they seem busy or annoyed, I fell like running away. Fortutely I have a very nice DR. who usually explains a lot of what I need to know without me asking. 
0.866667	I'm not disabled and real and speak English. I'm also not afraid to ask questions if I'm not sure I understand.
0.738900	I don't have a high knowledge of medical information but I feel I have people in my life that can help me and I know where to go for answers I do not know. I feel I can make the right choices with the help I receive and can explain the more difficult to understand terms and meanings.

0.916667	I am fully capable of helping myself . I do not need the assistance of any other person to help me complete or read documents provided to me.
0.666667	I do pretty well understand since I sick at a very young age. My doctor ask my was it ok to have understand why it was important to not miss my meds. Because they help me to say out the hospital or from having a bad Ashman .
0.638889	if i have any questions about anything i'll ask. I want to know as much as possible. it never hurt to ask any questions
0.916667	totally have the ability to answer questions and get information needed to be decisions that are best for me
0.583300	Obtaining information is not difficult.  The process and understanding is difficult sometimes.  This really is evident when it comes to cost.  More often then not, healthcare providers have no idea what a procedure or condition will cost. 
0.666667	i feel i understand basic info-but dont know terminology regarding procedures or prescriptions-anwser was considered too short but dont want to use big words just to pad answewr
0.916667	I am very much in my right stand of mind. I understand basic health information and advance health information. I do not need help or gotten help to understand.
0.761100	I can understand most things concerning health, but rarely ask for help when I do. That is a bad trait on my part.
0.883300	I feel like I am very able and comfortable obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, using resources such as my spouse, friends and the internet.
0.800000	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I find it really helpful, however, to have someone else read or hear at the same time to make sure that I think of or consider everything.
0.900000	I believe that I can interpret most information a doctor tells me. If I don't completely understand something I research it.
0.833300	I have the ability to obtain, process and understand health information to a great degree.  My healthcare providers can answer any questions I have and can explain things that I have difficulty understanding in ways that make it easier for me.  In addition, they can provide me with places to go online to obtain even more information should I need it.
0.866700	I feel I am capable to obtain the information I need to make my health decisions the majority of the time.  My mother was a nurse so I was exposed to medical terms at an early age.  I am also a college graduate, English is my native language and i read and comprehend well.
0.661100	I really like my Dr so getting the information I need is pretty easy.  The issue is sometimes remembering everything that was said.  He does give me the results of blood test so that helps. Remembering why and the importance of what he said is the issue.  I can always call the nurse however at any time and get a brief run down on the visit too if needed.  I feel like my Dr knowledge is what helps me make appropriate health decisions.  Plus he breaks it down pretty good.  
0.883300	To some extent- whatever I don't understand, I just ask questions. 
0.866700	I feel I have full capacity to make health decisions.  Sometimes the only thing that confuses me are questions regarding my health insurance.  Otherwise I have an easy time understanding medical information and directions.
0.916667	i have not had any type or signs of memory loss dementia at present. i still have the capability to handle paperwork
0.850000	Having quite a few medical issues, I have learned how to navigate all aspects of medical information.  It is imperative that I seek out information and be proactive when working with doctors and their staff.
0.827800	I feel that I have the capability and if I am struggling, my mother has a health background to provide additional needed information.
0.655600	When i am with the doctor or nurse i ask as many questions as i can. I want to know as much as i can know before i leave their office, because when i get home  it is so hard to find accurate information regarding a medical condition. I can look online but the internet has to much or incorrect information. Asking a friend or family member to help is not always the best information and mostly can be biased i think. It almost like every form needs to have an instruction book to come with it.
0.916667	I have total understanding of all medical conditions I have. I always ask questions of the doctor to make sure I understand everything in its entirety.
0.683333	I feel like I usually understand for the most part but sometimes I don't understand a few things but don't even ask so I don't look foolish. Sometimes I just say yes to everything without understand what they are going 
0.605556	Its hard sometimes because tou cant always get a hold of your doctor to go over results. Which makes it hard to research or get medication to help you.
0.811100	I feel pretty confident that I can obtain and understand my basic health information. 
0.916700	I understand my medical conditions and have done a lot of research on health issues.  I do research before I even go to a doctor if it seems a new health issue has popped up.  I have also studied medical information and terminology to help out my parents with their medical conditions.  I try to be as informed as possible before any doctor visit.  I have always been able to absorb and understand medical information easily.
0.744400	I struggle at times to understand printed material, particularly literature about prescribed medicines. Sometimes I have difficulty understanding a doctor's verbal explations, especially since they are always short on time. 
0.916700	I make sure to read all the materials carefully so I understand fully. I ask questions as they come up for clarity when needed. I can generally fill out all forms by myself but can get help for clarity if needed.
0.883333	I have a great understanding of medical information read, talked by doctor, or by others. If there is something I don't understand I either ask questions or research on my own.
0.916667	Any question I have about Heath or medication I will ask the doctor. I will read on what ever procedure I medically or for cosmetic purposes I will go to my local library and read on it. I will go online find the procedure and read everything I need to know there I have friends that are in the healthcare industry and will contact them for information as well. 
0.694400	I think with the boom in online information (which is pretty easily comprehensible, i.e., you can tell what's fake and what's reputable,) people have more ability than ever to assess details about particular medical conditions. I feel confident in this, at least. 
0.888889	I can comprehend what i reD. I may need some medical and technical terms explained in more detail. I can ask any questions to clarify 
0.572200	I think i have a fairly good capacity to retain information. Hearing it from a Doctor, Nurse or even my wife is my best way to get the information. While reading it i often get distracted and lose focus. Same goes for writing and filling out forms. 
0.800000	if I need more  information  on anything  I find  it  helpful  going  to the  internet  it  helps me  with  anything I  am confused about  because  sometimes I   feel  I  am bothering  people when  I ask   too  much
0.883300	I'm experienced enough that I've accumulated significant knowledge already. I can always access my health providers website or ask my doctor if I have questions. There are also thousands of websites providing an abundance of information. I have watched many hours of medical television and have become familiar with medical terminology.
0.916667	Im good with understanding  not sure wha else o say.  I work in health care so I understand it. that's all I can say
0.838889	I feel pretty confident but sometimes everyone needs help with the more technical parts I feel. Although most won't ask for help 
0.744400	Sometimes I get confused by the jargon and procedures. But in general, I can go to doctors appointment by myself and be fine. I can communicate and get the help I need. And doctors are usually good about explaining the important facts. If there is medicine or procedure I'm not familiar with, even after asking about it, I'll look it up online when I get home. 
0.916667	Completely able to do the above and complete understanding of all mentioned above. All past experience with doctors and nurses have completely understood all questions and answers at the time of my appointments.
0.733300	I feel like I have a really good capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information and services to make health decisions. There are some thing that I haven't understood but I am always able to find someone or look up the information myself to understand it.
0.811100	Because both my kids have had surgeries, one has food allergies and my consulting business often works with doctors, I am comfortable asking questions and feeling like I understand the whole picture by the time the office visit is over. I also worked in rehab facilities and was in charge of insurance several years ago, so official forms don't confuse me at all.
0.572222	I do not understand this question. So i am going to put in 100 random characters. This makes no sense. I have a dig bick. Firetrucks are red. My cousin is blonde. I am black. Ive never been shot. Lol who are you.i love  Burritos Burritos Burritos Burritos Burritos Burritos Burritos Burritos. Chipotle has good Burritos Burritos Burritos Burritos.
0.838900	I believe that I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding  base health information. If a situation arises where I am uble to understand a health condition fully, I am capable and willing to ask my health care provider to explain further. 
0.422200	Well recently I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and my doctor just gave me a pamphlet. I was not sure what to ask or what the next steps were and it was not explained to me either.   I felt like this was pretty serious and me having no knowledge of it should have been explained in detail but it was not. I would have to say i would really have to experience in obtaining information when it comes to my basic health information or what exactly i should be doing. I would rather hear it from a doctor then to have to google what i should be doing. 
0.872222	I feel that I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding all of the information I need to. I have a doctor answer questions and I will go online and do some research myself also. 
0.811111	I feel very confident in my ability. When it comes to my medical health I like to understand all that I can
0.750000	When a doctor or health professiol is there in front of me, I am usually comfortable asking questions and finding out answers. In this case it is usually pretty easy and straightforward as these people are usually able to help. However, when I do not have one of these people, finding the answers to my questions is much harder. I usually use the internet to find my answers but finding a reliable source on the internet is not always easy. 
0.916700	I feel very confident with my answers, mostly because if I don't understand something I am very good at looking it up on the computer. But I mostly comprehend what they tell me. Also I am like a very smart person.
0.672200	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand health information most of the time, but require assistance if things are overly technical. I have no problem in asking the nurses or doctors to explain information until I understand, and I often go online after an appointment to read-up further on my options. I feel that I have all the tools I need to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.872200	I feel like I have a fairly good understanding of medical terminology and basic health information. I know that I can ask as many questions as needed, and can always check the internet for anything I might have forgotten to ask. I have many family members in the medical field, and was raised with a basic understanding of how things work, so I am pretty confident.
0.916667	I'm totally capable of doing all of the things mentioned without any problem whatsoever.Not only do I do it for myself, I also help my other family members as well as my close friends.
0.866667	I go to  drs. Alot and answer and paper work myself so I don't have a problem asking about my health 
0.916667	I feel I am very capable of reading and understanding most medical information assuming it is documented in intelligent and explanatory terms
0.688900	If I dedicate the necessary time, I can usually figure everything out that was presented to me either in paper or verbal form. My biggest hangup is when it comes to billing from hospitals or doctors since it seems like the breakdown of charges is so detailed that it is easy to lose track of what expense was for what aspect of treatment. I do find myself not always able to ask the questions I would like to though when visiting a doctor because of how rushed it always seems. The doctors (any doctor) arrives after I have waited in the waiting room as well as in the examination room, and I know the doctor has other patients who are also waiting.
