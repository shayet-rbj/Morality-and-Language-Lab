-1	I feel basic medical information is easy to process, unless it is something that you are not aware of.

-1	Now most providers have online services so I have message them about anything and ask questions 24 hours a day, its all secure with quick replies too so this makes things easy for me.

Health related things are a lot more efficient and accessible than even just 5 years ago.

-1	I feel like I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as well as services however I would always have a little bit of uncertainty simply because you don't want to make mistakes regarding your health or the health of your children. I definitely think for minor health issues I can comprehend everything quite well but as things get more serious I tend to be a little more doubtful of myself.

-1	When I am meeting a doctor or health professional face-to-face, I feel fairly comfortable with obtaining and understanding health information as it applies to me.  This normally involves me asking several questions and occasionally asking for clarification.  There are also times when my doctor (who I've established a relationship with) will give me examples and scenarios as that is more in-tune with my learning style.

I don't understand a lot of medical terms, like names for tests. I also do not know pretty much anything about medicine. I have to pretty much completely trust my doctor's knowledge. I leave the doctor's office not knowing enough. I don't think to ask the right questions when i'm with the doctor. That or the appointment is so rushed that I don't have the chance to ask. I have to Google stuff a lot when it comes to medical stuff.

Since the body tends to work like a computer and much of the same logic can be applied in different ways, I believe that I am a person who can understand how different parts of the body may interact with each other.

1	I'm not sure what the heck is going on. But I am able to read and write. I don't need help in that department.
-1	Before I go to the Doctors office or Hospital, I research all of my symptoms to see if I can figure it out myself. If it is something that I can not determine I will go to the doctors office or emergency room for the proper attention of the matter. While I am in the appropriate place, if I do not know what is going on, I will ask questions to understand what is going on, so I can make the best decision for  myself. My going home care, I always speak to the doctor or nursing that is discharging me, to clarify everything that is going on, to ensure I have a good understanding. After going home, if I have any follow-up questions, I will call to get assistance.

I generally know what questions I need to ask to get the information I need, and try to give doctors and nurses enough information for them to treat me effectively. I occasionally ask for assistance from my wife recalling dates of shots and so on when filling out forms, but I donât think that is unusual. I think I am as capable as most people of making appropriate health decisions. I have some hearing loss, so it is helpful to have my wife along when discussing things with a health care worker so I donât misunderstand or nor hear something, but I can comprehend what is being said and am able to make necessary decisions.

-1	I would say to a very, very small degree. Everything about the process is puzzling to me and unless it's something basic (ie something like a simple cold), then I'll have am extremely hard time understanding. I don't know why but perhaps it has something to do with a fear of going to the doctor or hospital which makes it even more difficult for me.

One only needs to learn the tools.
1	I have the capacity to read and understand information and services because I have had extensive medical issues during to an auto immune system disease.

I do, however, believe that it is hard to ask doctors the right questions, and understand why they are giving you the information that they are.

-1	I feel that my abilities are more or less on par with the majority of the population. If I am given the tools and a rough idea of how they are used I feel I would have the capacity to navigate them. I would know where to find them or at the least who to ask to find out where to obtain them. I would have no issues processing or understanding them unless they used a lot of jargon. If they information was relevant it would likely help me make a health related choice.
-1	i could like to be very open to every individual so as whenever i will experience a problem, i will have somebody who will be willing to help me. i will stop beaing fearful because it will never give myself courage to ask what i will be needing about understanding my health status.whatever questions i will be having i will be so much free to the nurses and doctors so as to be efficiently helped

I am also familiar with a lot of the test that are preformed.
1	I am fairly young still so I don't have a ridiculous amount of pills or supplements that I need to take a day so that is one thing I do not have to worry about. However even at my young age I have spent a good amount of time in a few different hospitals. Two times because of an injury and once because of a personal health problem. I never really had any trouble understanding what exactly I needed to do in order to prevent any further injury. The doctors explained to me clearly what I needed to do and even if I didn't understand something I had no trouble asking them directly what to do.
-1	I believe that I have the capacity to understand all basic health information that is provided to me by medical professiols.

I ask an enormous amount of questions from my health provider before I make any decisions to take medications or have a procedure performed.

-1	I believe my ability to understand health information is sound. I have a medical condition that requires frequent contact with medical personnel to manage it. I have been able to do this for the past 3 years. 
-1	Given my ability to obtain process and understand medical information regarding my conditions, I would say that I have a good level of understanding, although with more complex heath issues I need a better explanation, that is usually given by a medical professional.

-1	I have full access to the internet. If a health care professiol does not provide information to answer all the questions I have (which come up after the visit), I look online.  I do not use blogs for the most part. I use credible sources for information.  Of course, if I have questions that cannot be answered at that point, I reach out to my PCP.  My PCP is actually available via internet for me, so I use that resource when appropriate. I have a small healthcare background as well, so I feel I am able to understand and comprehend better than someone with no healthcare background.

1	I'm usually able to understand what is told to me. I have a background in healthcare which helps me to better grasp concepts.
1	I don't have any real doubts about my ability to process basic health information. Obviously I'm not initially familiar with some of the terminology, etc, but the basic instructions are usually fine.

-1	I do feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health info because whenever I don't understand something I am the first one to ask for a clarification.

1	I think I do pretty good in all those areas of health decision making, with one exception. When I am not feeling well, I do sometimes ask for help in understanding the health communications from my doctors and nurses. This was an issue two years ago when I had a fall and a concussion. So I got a lot of healthcare information then, but I was suffering from concussion which made the understanding difficult by myself. Then I had to get help.
1	I am able to get the information I need. I usually understand the doctor's descriptions and written documents. If I have questions, I feel comfortable asking them.

-1	I have the capacity to understand the basic decisions that need to be made in health matters. I run into trouble when it comes to weighing different choices that have to be made that could have different outcomes.

-1	Yes I have a medical vackground that helps me understand basic medical terminology when I go to dr appts

1	I feel as though I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information fairly well. I feel like I understand it well  enough to make appropriate health decisions for not just myself but for my children as well. 
1	I feel that I have a good grasp of medical terminology and lingo. My grandparents and father have all had vast dealings with the medical community, which makes me feel comfortable and familiar with what happens at a hospital or a doctor's office. Medical professionals don't seem as intimidating and medical procedures as scary as they once did. That regular contact with medical professionals definitely makes me feel more confident in my ability to manage my own care. 
1	I can understand most of the materials presented. Sometimes the physician is obscure and assume you know what they are talking about. In that case, I ask them to elaborate or make themselves more clear. 
-1	I think I have pretty good capacity but from time to time I might need some help. Like understand some medical terms or what exactly a paper work wants from me.

1	I feel that I have the complete capacity to explain and understand basic health information.  I have complete capabilities to understand things. And I also have the capacity to explain anything that is a problem, or anything that needs explaining. 
-1	I can read but it's hard for me to concentrate on what I am reading so I usually have to read a sentence three times. I'm not good at asking questions, I have a predisposition of not wanting to impose on people. 
1	I have been with the same doctor for about 15 years. I am very comfortable asking him questions about any issues I have. I do not feel like he rushes to get me out of the office. He takes his time and answers my questions. He is thorough in all my health care needs.

I feel if I could process it and understand it better then I would put a greater trust in the medical profession.

-1	I feel I am quite competent to read, process, understand and utilize information that is provided to me in a written format. Sometimes when I am given verbal instructions, I like to have another person with me because Iâm afraid I wonât remember everything correctly. 
-1	I definitely have the capacity but sometimes I am tentative to ask for clarification of things or ask the doctor for more information because I do not want to sound stupid or get nervous of the answers if I ask more. I'm also young so I sometimes need to speak with my parents before filling out forms and such.
1	I have the capacity to make health decisions.  I have some medical background and I am very good a research if I have questions that come up later.
-1	I believe I am fully capable of being able to understand, process, and obtain the needed information in order for me to make health decisions that are well informed.

I also will ask medical professionals for clarification as needed. 
1	I feel very competent to understand ,process, and to obtain everything to make appropriate health decisions
1	Given the amount of information available on the internet, it is easy to look up medical information that I have not heard of or have difficulty understanding. Many medical community backed webpages such as Medscape aid in providing information 
-1	Persolly, I have taken some college courses toward my medical assisting degree so I am able to understand some of what my health professiols are talking about but anything I do not understand I make sure to look up and read more information from trusted websites or ask someone I trust and know. Therefore, I believe my ability to understand and process healthcare information is average to above average.

-1	I think I am capable to obtain and understand the info I am given, when my docter or nurse, other medical personnel speak in terms I understand. If I am near my computer I can research any info. I am unsure of.
1	I feel I have decent capacity to achieve all of these.  The internet is a good source of info that I can leisurely spend my time on as needed for this.  Google and discussion forums provide most of the info I would find if I need to conduct such as search.
-1	I work at a hospital so I am exposed to a lot more lingo/ terminology than others so I have a better grasp and understanding.
-1	I try to remember and understand everything. I try to listen well and ask the right questions. If I can I will take a friend with me to help me to remember things.
1	I have no problem whatsoever. I can communicate clearly and am a reasonable and intelligent person. The only problem I ever incur is when a foreign doctor has a heavy accent and I can't understand him or her.
-1	I often feel like it is a struggle to understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions.
1	My veterinarian technician skills help me understand health questions. I also research diagnostics and other things questions plus my oldest daughter works at the children's hospital in Denver, co.

-1	It's very easy to call and obtain Health records from the physicians office, but sometimes the medical terminology can be a bit difficult to understand. 
1	I think I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Although I sometimes don't understand things, for instance what the difference is between a new medication and the one I'm stopping, when I ask for clarification I can generally understand the answers given to me. I feel that I am capable of using this information to make appropriate decisions regarding my healthcare.
-1	I think I do a pretty good job of obtaining, understanding, and processing the information presented to me by medical professionals. I try to ask questions to ensure I understand, though sometimes I do find myself regretting that I didn't ask certain questions or forgot to after the encounter is over with.
-1	I feel pretty confident until I actually get to the Drs office - it can be overwhelming. Nerve racking. You forget what you want to say (i try to write things down) but also, it sometimes goes so fast that you forget or blank out.  It always helps when the Dr gives you pamplets, but those can also be either vague or way too much info or jargon.
1	I feel I have full compability to make all appropriate health decisions  I have no problems with filling out forms or obtaining health information
-1	Most medical information is at our finger tips these days, so if I don't fully comprehend something, I look it up. however, I'm not afraid to ask a doctor or nurse to explain things further to me until I fully understand. 
1	i am capable of understanding questions and providing answers to my dr or nursing staff .. very smart and very health conscious 
1	I feel very confident in my knowledge to comprehend information and ask questions relating to my health.
-1	I'd say that I'm moderately good at doing this but this is also due to recently becoming a lot more independent than in the past so I now do all of this stuff on my own. I make sure to ask questions and go to my doctors regularly and consistently so I can stay on top of my healthy and learn to live a healthy life. The thing that's hardest for me is healthy insurance because there are so many variances based on the type of doctor I see and what's covered and what isn't but that is a learning trend not associated with my health information directly.
-1	I think that most times I can understand what my doctor is trying to tell me, if not I ask questions until I do understand
-1	I can fully understand the medical produces an i am in my right mind i take care of myself. I dont need anyone to fill any paper work for me
-1	I feel mostly confident in my ability to understand basic health information and all the decisions that go with it. My hesitancy so say I am 100% confident stems strictly from medical confusion I get from time to time. In the medical profession now there are so many differing opinions that anything more than one source (doctor) is involved, explations become a little jumbled in my mind because of their differing views. I think this sometimes inhibits my ability to make faster and firm decisions about my health.
-1	i always ask when i don't understand something, doesn't mean i process it well, o other than that i have no idea what else to say
1	i feel confident that I have the ability to ask the appropriate questions to get the answers that I need.
-1	My family took care of my mother for 7 years before she died. I was the main caregiver. I learned that you must be proactive with your own health or anyone you're caring for. I know how to ask questions when I don't understand something. I know how to research it and gain the knowledge I need to feel comfortable with whatever it is I'm trying to understand.
1	I feel like there is enough information available online that most people can do research and gather adequate information to make relatively accurate decisions regarding their health without consulting professionals.
-1	Getting and understanding the information is the easy part. Having the money to pay for the services is the hard part. I usually understand what I'm being told without asking a lot of questions. That's just me though: way back in high school, my biology teacher asked me if I learned by osmosis because I did well in class but never asked questions.
1	I believe I am sufficient in being able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I usually have no problems understanding basic health information and services needed if I need to make health decisions.
-1	I am able to read and understand material given to me regarding health. If I do have a question I have no problem asking for help to understand. 
-1	I am very confident that I understand and medical advice I am given. Sometimes I do have to go home and look up some of the medical terms.
1	I feel I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information.  I have a degree in veterinary technology so I have a background in medical terminology and a basic understanding of how diseases/the body operates.
-1	I am able to process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions without difficulty. My problem is, I am hard of hearing and have trouble collecting all the information the doctor provides. I always take my spouse to my appointments so she can later relay any of the things I may have missed.
1	Anytime I go to the doctor for something, they give me pamphlets that describe whatever my issue is.  The same thing with prescribed medications.  Whenever I do not understand something, I can usually find an article about it online that covers what I need to know.
-1	Even if i do not know the content or context of the health forms i can generally use context clues to understand the forms and make myself as caught up or as informed as possible with all decisions.
1	I feel comfortable with my level of knowledge.  I am confident in making decisions as it relates to my health 
-1	I feel like I am constantly having to look up information about my medical health on my own, like on Google, and I'm having to make sense of it all on my own. Also, many times doctors seem like they don't know, until I search it and tell them about it and then they look into. This is so stressful for me. 
1	I am in the healthcare field so I don't usually have problems with understanding my medical or health information.  I'm not gonna say I haven't asked questions before because of course I don't know everything.  But for the most part I understand my health issues without any confusion or misunderstandings.
1	I feel i can relate symptoms to known conditions and input my own variables into the equation to make sure everything is correct. I also sometimes rely on stories from people with similar conditions and things that didn't/did work for them.
-1	I feel like I handle health information pretty well.  As long as it is basic information anyway.  The minor things you have to fill out when you get to the doctor or that they explain to you during routine or semi-routine checkups I believe I fully understand.  When it gets to some of the more complicated explanations I need a little more guidance.  I don't always know exactly what they are talking about when they go in depth about things.
-1	I'm perfectly capable of doing these things for myself. I don't have the need for any help of any kind from anyone. If I did, I would just go to the internet to find what I needed.
-1	Sometimes it is hard to do it by yourself I'm 23 years old and it is still hard for me I feel more comfortable if someone was with me like my mom or my dad or my wife
-1	I think I am able to understand basic health information but I sometimes get overwhelmed and find myself unable to fully process information. It is helpful for me to have someone with me to rephrase what is being told to me. I also find that I do not always remember to ask questions if there is something I wanted to know, so I usually prepare ahead of time with someone who can remind me about what my questions were. 
1	I do just fine with my basic health information. Why must I use 100 chacters to say I do just fine at understanding the information I'm given and if no I would have no problem asking for more information or a clearer explanation of what they are telling me
-1	I feel as though I have a lot of capacity to reach the services I need to in order to help myself to basic healthcare and information for services needed.
-1	for the most part i do feel that i understand most basic health information but i sometimes i do find myself going onto google in order to understand more about health information. i learn alot by going to google.
1	I feel extremely confident I can process and understand basic health information decisions and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself
-1	I feel I have 100% of the basic capacity to understand, and make appropriate health decisions. If I don't understand all components I have the ability to research whatever it is I am having a hard time with. Sometimes in order to understand something you have to ask a few questions, research a few things, and be willing to put in work to understand how to assist yourself. Health care related documents can be a hard task to understand , but with that being said its better to understand then to pretend to understand and mess up something major. 
-1	I think that I could understand all of the basics...if I had a disease or some special new circumstances, that might be more difficult.  The biggest barrier for me would be speaking up and asking questions.  I am impatient, sometimes I don't want to hear an elaboration on something that scares me, and/or I may feel like I have already taken up enough of the doctor's time.

-1	It depends on what they are saying.  Some times they speak with you, some times they speak at you.  The doctors some times look you in the eye, and some times they do not.  Some times the doctors are compassionate and give you the time that you need, some times the doctor's offer advice, but most of the time they give you a script and send you on your way. Once in a while a doctor will listen to you, understand how you are feeling and send you off to another doctor.  This doctor will some times give you the amount of time that you need, give you another script, as well as give you another appointment. Now you are seeing two doctor's, the original doctor who referred you to the second doctor - making certain that you are happy with the referral doctor, and then you go back to the referral doctor for treatment.
