0.788900	I feel I have have a large ability to process basic health decisions. I am biased though, as I have a degree in human physiology, was an EMT, and am about to attend physician assistant school in May. However, before going to college, I did have a very hard time understanding what was being told to me by PCPs and felt what they told me was poorly explained.

This, in addition to complicated medical and insurance forms, made it very difficult to gain anything from visiting the doctor.

0.838900	pretty completely. It is not that hard and if some terms are not understood I can google it. 
0.850000	"I have the capability to do all of the above.  The problem comes in understanding the always changing process, being told one thing by one nurse/doctor and being told something else by another.  Sometimes the information presented to read and understand at times reads like its meant for professiols in the field, not the non-medical educated.  I do a lot of asking when big medical words are used ""what does that mean"".  Sometimes I feel like I'm just supposed to understand and process what they want me to!  My health is good enough and I'm educated enough to understand most, but people like my mom have no clue and just go on whatever doctors want to do and trust."

0.744400	I think it can be difficult because they are just trying to push the protocols on you and not necessarily do what is helpful to you or what you want. Especially in the case of my pregncies. I also do not understand the labs and stuff like that and I always have to ask and usually they dont even give you a copy, only when you go to a specialist or something then you see.

It's been a year and I am still trying to ascertain the estrogen at my age going away and the swelling and pain I am having. Trying lyrica but that is causing weight gain. Hard to get professionals to see me as not fat but swollen! I ask questions likely better than most because I have a child who has Cerebral Palsy with 2 VP Shunts for hydrocephalus who requires frequent shunt revisions. This has taught me to speak up since he cannot talk. I have to ask all questions and think all the time about what could be ""up."" I am not afraid to ask any question and when I do meet a stubborn provider for him I am now quick to tell them I will no longer need their services. Then I find another. For me, I usually am not as assertive."

For example, if the doctor gives me a document about a vaccine he is recommending then I like to have someone look over it with me and I like to look up information about it instead of giving an immediate answer by myself.

That would be one of the few circumstances where I need assistance in making the best decision for my health.

However I'm no doctor or nurse and I struggle to really get to the bottom of things that ail me.  Additionally I don't know what's the appropriate questions or information to ask a doctor or tell a doctor to help them better diagnose any health problems.  Some times my terminology might off and there's misunderstandings from using the wrong terminology.  I really suffer from also not understanding all the specialists such as neurologist ( i know that one, but don't know most of the other ones).

The information that is usually shipped or tagged with medication is usually quite confusing, so having a doctor who is very good at explaining things, alongside the fact that I always ask questions and research information online keeps me informed.
0.700000	I feel that I am very able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services.  What I have trouble with, is when I read the possible side effects or health risks for medication I am prescribed, I can't tell if it's worth the risk or not.  This is bothersome, and there seems to be no clear way to know - it's like you take your chances when you take a drug, that you will not be one of the ones who has a side effect (some side effects are minimal, but others are very serious - like death!).  I wish there was a better way to assess the risk/benefit of taking drugs.  Also, I am very capable when I am well to make decisions regarding my health, but if I was very sick, I would probably want to make sure I had someone with me who was not sick to help me process information correctly...

0.850000	I feel like I have complete capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Most of the time, when I ask for help with understanding a condition, it is only because the condition is new to me and I would like further explanation. Most of the time the doctors are glad to offer additional information. Only when I run across the rare statement in paperwork that I do not understand completely do I ask for clarification and it is usually received promptly.
0.916667	I have full capacity, I am mentally sound and have a Masters Degree in English.  Your questions are offensive.

0.827800	I feel very capable of processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. However I struggle with obtaining information from my healthcare providers because I'm often intimidated by them and don't want to look stupid by asking too many questions. Or oftentimes, the provider will rush through our appointment so I feel as if I would be bothering them by any more detailed questions. 
0.661100	Oftentimes it can be quite overwhelming to take in the whole medical field information. Many terms are used that are very unfamiliar which in turn makes it all the more difficult to understand. While I may feel like asking questions I sometimes do not because I am most afraid that it will become even more overwhelming.  Most of the time I find myself googling things said by my medical professional in order to get a more clear understanding.  I also save the pages so I can refer back if I forget the terms or information. 
0.616700	I'm often times too shy to ask for help or further explation. However, I also feel that doctors and nurses have a tendency to rush things. I can barely even get my questions in because they just breeze through the appointment like they don't really want to be there or they have other things to be doing. I understand that they are busy, but this gets really frustrating as I almost always leave the office feeling as if there is more I need/want to know.
0.916700	I have wonderful doctor that is down to earth and the Health clinic I go to makes it easy to understand what they need from me. I think it comes down to communication and at the places I get my physicals etc they are very competent and helpful.

0.633300	I feel that I can make decisions regarding my own health to a greater degree than professiols. It is somewhat insulting that I have to go to a dermatologist for acne medication that has never heard of tea tree oil. I have had a doctor tell my mother and myself that nutrition has no impact on hormones or the thyroid gland. I've entirely lost faith in the qualifications of healthcare professiols.
0.750000	I feel empowered to make the decisions for myself. I think I always make the right decision. I am fully trained to understand all the points and you see medical information

0.677800	I feel that I sometimes understand basic health information. There are times when I am reading my online medical chart after I get a result in that I will need to call the doctor to understand what it is saying. Most of the time I will make an appointment after getting a result back, just so I have that one on one conversation with my doctor. It feel I understand better when they explain to me face to face. That is when I feel I process the information very well. Especially when they show me different examples of what is going on in my body. It helps when the doctor doesn't seemed rushed. I think when the doctor is rushed not a lot of information is obtained.
0.861100	I feel I have enough capacity to understand all but the most complicated of medical information. I'm talking stuff that wouldnt be understandable unless read by a medical student or doctor though. I have  a good enough understanding of many medical things to understand them. 
0.805556	I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of what my doctors try to explain to me in layman's terms. I also do alot of research and also took anatomy in college, which helps. I'm able to put symptoms together to try to figure out what's wrong by researcher and then also explain that to my doctor. It doesn't take alot for me to wrap my brain around the human anatomy.
0.916667	I have the perfect capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have no issues with doing this.

0.744444	i have a very great doctor. She's very good at helping me understand what i need to understand. And she takes her time explaining things to me.
0.550000	I go to the doctor and listen to what they have to say and then ask questions when I don't understand something 
0.733333	I fully understand the process , I just hope most of the times the doctor will tell you the side effect instead of you asking them. 
0.666700	I am educated and articulate, but I feel like dissemination of information is so provider-specific. For instance, I have a mild condition that was recently diagnosed, and what the doctor told me in terms of how common it is was not at all consistent with what his nurse told me, and what I had found anecdotally. So while I have the capacity to process quantitative information, sometimes it's more difficult when individual communication styles come into play.
0.872222	I feel that I am able to understand most medical material handed to me.  I rarely ever need to ask a medical professional to elaborate.
0.783300	I have a severe traumatic brain injury and get a fair amount of mental health treatment.  I don't necessarily understand all of the information I am presented, but I always have someone that can explain things to me.  Either the doctors or an aide that helps me with handling everyday tasks.
0.883300	English is my first language and I'm of normal intelligence, so I don't see why I would have problems understanding basic health information and services. With respect to obtaining information, most doctors and staff I've met seem quite willing to provide whatever information is requested or needed.
0.916700	I feel extremely confident in my ability to advocate for myself. 
0.783300	I feel I have a reasonable ability to understand basic health information and services and that I have the basic ability to make decisions about my health.  I feel I have an average ability for comprehension and if there is something I do not understand I have the ability to look up the information I need to know. 
0.811100	I am not always 100% confident that I understand everything I need to understand. However, I know enough that I trust I am making the right decisions for myself. Often, I lack 100% confidence simply because sometimes there is not a definite answer my physician can give me, and they cannot predict the future. Specifically I had a difficult pregnancy and really no one could give me an answer on why I had the problems I did. So I relied on my own research to try to get a better answer. 
0.794400	I feel that I am able to get the information that I need about my health when I need it because my doctors are easy to talk to and understand me when I ask for  help. They make sure to talk to me in words that I understand and make sure that they ask me questions before I leave them so that I do know what is going on before I leave the room. 
0.883333	I believe that having been educated and having earned a college degree I am able to ascertain and understand most basic medical situations. I have a great relationship with both my physician and his nurse who will take the time to ensure that you understand medical issue and documentation of continued logs.My doctor explains what numbers mean from blood work. We look at what the chat said from the pass year in comparison to this years result. Their office maintain their charts to schedule appropiate shots, tests, etc.
0.672200	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand health information most of the time, but require assistance if things are overly technical. I have no problem in asking the nurses or doctors to explain information until I understand, and I often go online after an appointment to read-up further on my options. I feel that I have all the tools I need to make appropriate health decisions. 
0.855600	I feel that I can accurately understand and use the health information provided to me to make the necessary decisions. I also don't have any problems asking questions in case I need to understand certain things.
0.883300	I believe I am pretty competent and intelligent and would be able to understand any basic health information I am given and any services I would need to have in the future.
0.916700	I feel confident in my ability to handle health information. I have a background in health insurance, so that part of the equation is very easily understood. I also have fine research skills, a large vocabulary and enough general experience at the age of 48, that I know how to find out anything, of which I am unsure. I'm ufraid to speak with health care professiols. 
0.755556	i can understand health information about me or any of my family members  I have been through a lot of health issues
0.761100	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a moderate degree. I think this is due to internet access and doctors making efforts for their services to be more accessible for patients. I do have some difficulty in having a few options and making the best decision out of those and seek guidance from a health professional or online.
0.844400	I am knowledgeable in the terms and words used so I can answer and understand what they ask or am able to comprehend the material. The doctors and nurses usually let me know of the situation in an easy to understand fashion so I am not confused. 
0.900000	I feel I am the only person truly responsible for my health. I take great care to be very aware of medical information that applies to me.

0.855600	I have sufficient knowledge and reading comprehension skills to understand basic medical information. I've also had fairly extensive experience with care issues of family members over many years, so I've gleaned a fair amount of basic medical knowledge.
0.844400	I don't feel like I have any trouble understanding and processing the information I receive.  Even if I don't understand something right away, I know where to go to get help figuring it all out.
0.588900	I feel I have a capacity to learn the information ,but it is difficult due to the wording , and the way the medical information is presented. If I had better resources and someone to  explain some of the working I feel I would have not problems finding out that information
0.866700	I feel I have the ability to process most information when it is presented in a transparent way 
0.761111	I have a hard time sometimes with the medical jmbo mumbo. I can basically understand all that I need to understand. I do not have that many problems with understanding.
0.861111	I believe I understand information well and am able to ask any necessary questions. If I do need help, I ask.
0.872200	Since I have not had experiences with uncommon disease or sickness, except from regular health check and common cold, I do not really have much more experience with health information and services.  In fact, aside from some emergencies in my teege and younger years visit to hospital due to injury, accident, the past 8 years, the only time I have to stop by the doctor was to drive someone else close to me for health check up.  Because of this, as far as health information and services needed for me, I am up to date on most of them, plus I am rather good at internet when I need to do research on something peculiar related to health

0.627800	I have a decent capacity for those things but I definitely need some help understanding some things. A lot of what I see seems to be written in a foreign language so I sometimes ask for help. I definitely need to ask more questions when I am speaking with a nurse or doctor. I just feel like I am asking a stupid question so I am too nervous to speak up
0.750000	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I do try to research medications (if needed) so I may ask appropriate questions to my medical doctor and or pharmacist. 
0.883300	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health info and services needed. If I feel like I don't, I can call the doctors office after I leave if I have additional questions and/or concerns.

Luckily my mother is a family practice doctor, so when I need help understanding health information and services I can usually call her and she'll explain it to me. Sometimes, though, there are things that I don't know and I don't know the right questions to ask to figure it out, so I'm left in the dark. 
0.755556	I always ask my doctor what things mean when I do not understand what is talk about. When I go any doctor office I ask what they is saying. I sometimes ask other health people about  things like nurse  drug store.It mean a lot to me that know what's go no with my health.

0.916700	I feel I have a good doctor and am able to openly communicate and discuss issues with them. I am open about my health issues which I think you need to be in order to get the help you need. I understand for the most part what the Dr says and what I am not sure of I ask questions. My husband will also ask questions which further helps with any questions that may arise or answers we may need. My husband and I share the same Doctor and we typically schedule appointments at the same time so the Doctor sees us together in an hour block.  This also helps us communicate better as we are both there and can both ask questions we may have

There was once a time when I needed information on why I was bleeding in between periods and to an extent it was helpful but then there was contradictory information and some information was unclear. I ended up asking my doctor directly and he explained it just fine. There was another time I needed to find out if my insurance covers a test I needed and no one could tell me. I called the health insurance company, I am not kidding, they did not know the answer. But for the most part, it's easy to obtain most answers to my health questions and to understand what I am being told.

0.677800	recently i had a kid. After he born we are going to take him to doctor for monthly checkups. We came to know the process of handling kids and each time we go for checkup nurse provides us a plan for next few months. I think this will help us to know all things. There are few instructions as well if baby is facing any health issue. It simply helps us to know how to treat babies while they are not feeling good. Pediatricians also helps us to know things. I came to know and understand the process how they are treating.

0.666700	I feel somewhat confident in getting the basic services and information needed in my life.  Sometimes I feel rushed in the doctors office which makes me shift into anxiety mode.  When I'm anxious, no matter how intelligent I am normally it's hard to comprehend the forms and information given to me.  I need time to calm down and process things.  I often feel frustrated with understanding forms when I'm in the frame of mind.  When I'm presented with new health information, I need time to process and research to know what questions to ask.  At the time, I feel too agreeable because I'm just trying to get the appointment over with and the doctor is in a hurry.
0.916667	I have the capacity to understand all medical related information that is presented to me. I also make sure to ask pertinent questions regarding my health care and anything else I may not be aware of. The idea of being my own self advocate gives me assurance that I am making the right choices and also understanding my rights as a patient.
0.888900	"I have no problem understanding health information that is given to me.  The problem is when doctors are more concerned with a ""treat and street"" philosophy merely going through the motions to check off boxes for insurance companies than actually LISTENING to patients and taking the time to ask the questions that need to be answered in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  Patients often do not know that a symptom is just that so when a doctor fails to asks the right questions there will likely not be an accurate diagnosis.  Another issue is when a doctor blatantly ignores my questions.  How many ways to I have to ask the most basic question of what does this diagnosis mean?  More often than not it's just easier to go home and search webmd or the Mayo Clinic website.  Problem with that is I generally end up with even more unanswered questions.  Ultimately I am quite capable of understanding information when it is provided and if my questions are answered with more than a couple of words.  (The correct answer to ""what does the thyroid do?"" is NOT ""Pep"" and after a look of disbelief ""You know, energy"")"

0.900000	I feel confident that I can understand and make my own decisions about health and basic services. I grew up in a family that my mother was a X-ray tech.  She talked and explain a lot about medical things.
0.738889	I feel like there's so much conflicting information about health that it's hard to get the correct answer and doctor's are often too rushed to answer all of my questions.

0.872222	I feel that I have ample resources at my disposal to help me research, learn, and understand whatever medical conditions I may have. I can contact my doctor, a nurse, ask a person knowledgable about the medical field, or look it up online to  aid me in making health decisions.

0.900000	Yes I feel that I am able to hear what my doctor says and understand their recommendations. There are times when I forget to ask them specific questions or give them details I had planned to mention. I usually ask them to clarify instructions just in case I misunderstood. Sometimes they do not give details and I have to ask them for instructions.

So I have good handle on what needs to be filled out or asked in order to coordinate my health care issues with my doctor. I research everything on line on the different medical websites.  I ask questions and make notes to follow up with my PCP to make sure we are on the same page. I question when there is something I do not like or disagree with, which is often.  I do not believe some of the things I am told so I will research and bring my questions and results to my PCP.
0.811100	I feel I am pretty capable of understanding the basic health information and services I may need to make appropriate health decisions.

0.733300	I feel that I have a tendency to take longer to process such matters.  This is not surprising as I am autistic.  I mage to make appropriate health decisions out of sheer persistence more than immediate aptitude.  If I have forgotten a question at an appointment I contact the doctor later, all over again, etc.
0.900000	I'm pretty capable of understating medical stuff. Dealt with stuff with my son when he had surgery last year as well as myself. Advocating for one self is important.

0.861111	I can understand everything pretty good when it comes to understanding a doctor or the paper work needed

0.833300	I have full access to the internet. If a health care professiol does not provide information to answer all the questions I have (which come up after the visit), I look online.  I do not use blogs for the most part. I use credible sources for information.  Of course, if I have questions that cannot be answered at that point, I reach out to my PCP.  My PCP is actually available via internet for me, so I use that resource when appropriate.
