0.760000	I have a physician that takes the time to explain all of his decisions, I also look up his decisions on line at different sites
0.760000	My doctor is ok. its the nurse practioner that i usually see when the dr is busy. She is extremely thorough. She will run every kind of test to rule out things. Especially since I've had cancer before.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I find him to be credible, well educated, and trustworthy.  He provides attention and familiarity with the issues that have faced me in the past, and face me currently.  Additiolly, he is well reputed in the medical community and has to my knowledge provided sound treatment and service to me. 
0.840000	Whenever I have my yearly check up with my doctor I have trust in the outcome.  But if I were diagnosed with something I was not sure about I would get a second opinion.  I have a pretty good trust in doctors because before I go to a doctor I research him/her first so I know I have the best pretty much.
0.200000	He doesn't know my history even though I've been seeing him for years. I have had the same complaint for 3 years and he has done nothing to find a cause. 
0.680000	I do some things, my doctor tell me to do, like lose weight, but i don't put 100% trust in my doctor, I don't think any one should either.
0.560000	My doctor seems to be on a timer. I don't feel he wants to spend any extra time because he has so many patients or whatever. The last time I saw him in November 2017, he more or less lectured me that I need to lose weight. My A1C was 7 so he appeared upset. I had a short visit and I'm scheduled to see him again in March of 2018. I may cancel the appointment.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he if very thorough and explains things well. He is very caring and takes time out at the beginning of my visit to ask about my life and family. He never rushes his patients and takes a good amount of time with them.
0.800000	My doctor does not seem rushed when she is with me. She is calm, takes her time, and explains everything.  If I have questions, she answers them fully. She never makes me feel stupid for asking any questions, and never makes me feel like she needs to get on to the next patient. I feel like I have her full attention. 
0.760000	I dont really have much of an option to not trust my doctor. If i didn't trust my doctor, then i need to find one that i can. Besides that, i feel that they are the expert in their field just as i am an expert in my field. They should know what they are talking about and if they dont, they should either tell me they dont, or find someone that does.
0.800000	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a long time. She always explains everything to me in clear, easy to understand way. She thoroughly explains all the options of treatment and suggests the best one for my needs.
0.640000	I trust my Primary care physician for the most part, however, if he were to put me on a drug of some sort, I'm not sure he would be open to exploring all drugs used to treat a condition, or if he would choose the drug that he is comfortable with, or the drug of the sales rep that brought in lunch that day.  Overall, though, I do think he has my best interests at heart and wouldn't do anything to harm me.
0.680000	I don't get to go to the best Dr.s My insurance sends me to a clinic. The Haitian men Dr.'s there speak English as a second language. I do not trust them. 
0.600000	The major issues I've experienced with my health are things that are not easily diagnosed and sometimes doctors still don't think it even exists. So I'm brushed off quite a bit and that makes me wary of trusting a doctor.
1.000000	I trust him because he points me in the right direction when it comes to medication and to find a specialist. He would tell me the good and the bad when it comes to the medication and the specialist.
0.600000	I trust my primary physician, because they are consistent about my well being. They always asked if I need anything or any questions I need to ask, or about any problems former or current.
0.760000	I do not have a long relationship with my doctor but am confident that they are skilled and motivated to address my issues. 
0.880000	I really like my doctor and have been going to her for several years. However, there was one time when she misdiagnosed a problem I was having. Perhaps part of the problem was the way I described the situation. However, she put me on some medication which, after reading about it, I felt wasn't necessary at all. It turned out the problem was with my teeth and a dentist was the appropriate doctor to fix my problem.
0.760000	I think that their reputation are on the line so they are generally honest.  There are people who expect miracles from doctors so sometimes the doctor has to answer the best he can but needs to move on to the next patient so he may be a bit short with answers. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor quite a bit.  She is upfront with me about things, and straightforward on her opinion of what I need to do. She also has been right so far about everything.
0.560000	I just changed doctors a few months ago.  The previous MD didn't help me with a Sever cough.  I wound up going to a nearby Hospital's ER  for treatment of Dust Phenomena.  I was lucky it was a mild case.  My New Doc, MD....To Be Continued.
0.840000	They show that they care I never have trust issues they explain everything to me that I need to know and answer all questions
0.640000	I trust my primary care physician. He always address my problems. At times I feel I have to remind him of something and than he agree to look at the problem.But always addresses my issues and look further to be sure things are OK&gt;
0.640000	I do not put my full trust in doctors because most do not care for your health unless they are getting paid.  If you have no insurance they set you aside than rather to assist you.
1.000000	I've been to doctors in the past that I've questioned some of their decisions, but I'm very happy with the current doctor I see.  She is knowledgeable, well-educated and respects me as a patient.  She listens to my concerns and responds in an appropriate way.
0.560000	They are just guessing on how to fix whatever ails me.  It's always a gamble trying a new medicine. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care doctor because they went to school to know what they are doing. Also if it sounded like they didn't know what they were doing I would not go to them 
0.680000	My doctor is great he listens to me and my needs.  Along with his nurses and communicated very well with my concerns.
0.760000	Even there not always right , there ability to listen, observe and assist brings comfort and assertiveness
0.280000	The reasons why I do not trust my primary care physician is that I have the impression that they mostly care about safeguarding their liability instead of being concerned about the patient's medical needs
0.720000	well sometime they have best heart for me and sometime I  feel like they don't when I feel he or she is giving the wrong information
0.800000	I trust primary care physicians because in general, they have extensive training and tend to see many patients over the course of a short time span. They are typically knowledge and willing to refer me to specialist if a condition is out of their scope of expertise. I would not trust a primary care physician who is overworked or tired because I would think their judgement would be affected. 
0.840000	She takes my concerns seriously and takes the time to make sure all my questions are answered to my satisfaction
1.000000	"I trust my doctor because she gives me answers without ""sugar coating"" anything, she tells me how good or bad things really are. She gives me options as far as what kind of medicines I should take, like how I want to only take medicine in the evening and not any in the morning. If something is not right for me she is very willing to have me try something else. She is not one of those doctors that always has to be right, with rigid opinions. She is flexible and willing to work with me."
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he is a professional.  I am also in good health so I know that I am not at risk.
0.560000	My doctor seems interested in moving people from the in door to the out door in record time.  He rarely gives more than ten minutes of time to his patients.  
0.800000	My primary care doctor is somebody who I have known for quite some time. I trust that he has my best interests at heart and will always make sure that his decisions reflect where I want to be with the treatment. 
0.440000	i don't usually trust doctors because they just make me feel uncomfortable. sometimes i feel like they don't listen to me at all. i also oftentimes feel like i am being judged by them. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because she has never made any decision that have harmed me. They have all been for the best. 
0.800000	My doctor has been in the area for a very long time.  My husband and I both go to him.  He has actually helped find the right diagnoses for something that has been overlooked for many many years.  He is thorough and takes his time talking to me about what I am there for.  He is well respected in the area.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician. She is very knowledgeable about a lot of conditions. The only thing I'm not thrilled about is she tries to get me to take medicine I don't want, instead of looking at natural options first. I know she was trained that way, but I want to try to heal naturally instead of using medicine.
0.640000	I want to trust my doctor but perhaps it's TV or just my lack of health care growing up. I have an issue with trust. I mean it seems sometime they herd you like cattle. They see you for 2 minutes then it's time to pay and leave. They offer no personal connection. I feel like maybe doctors out in the country where things go at a slower pace and people care about each other more I could trust my doctor but here in the city I don't 
0.760000	i have never had a reason to distrust them. They have never lead me in the wrong direction and they are always available to answer any questions that i have.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has always done right by me. He answers all my questions and listens to my concerns.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear not what I want to hear.
0.680000	They don't know everything but are once source of information. For important cases, i value multiple opinions.
0.600000	I do trust that doctors are not in it to just make the money, but to provide good health care. They will be honest it what they think is the best treatment for you. However, I know doctor's cannot go into detail about the possible long term effects of a treatment so I always like to do my own research. Particularly reading forums and such.
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician because she's been there for me for the last decade. I've gone to her whenever I had issues, major or minor. I've built a relationship with her. That always helps. If I go to a new doctor, I don't think I will have that same feeling.
0.800000	My physician likes to push different new medications on me instead of worrying about the side effects that I would have in taking these medications. I do get a great deal from my physician in the way of ordering test and sharing about my disease. I wish that my physician cared about my daily issues and not so much about the different medications they want me to try. My doctor comes off as a drug pusher at times. I also feel as if my doctor is always in a rush and that makes me lose my concentration.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I've been seeing him/ her for over 4 years and they answer my questions and so far they've given me the right medicine that makes my life go a little easier
0.720000	I do care about my primary care physician because i have a close relationship with him and he knows me for years
0.720000	I trust them but not one hundred percent. The reason its not 100 percent is due to the fact that I feel they are in bed with big pharma. They are always trying to get you to take some sort of pill. Thats why I dont trust them completely. They at times seem to have ulterior motives with these pills. They wont hurt you, just push them like dealers. 
0.760000	My former physician has made the best decisions about my medical care based on the tests and my answers to his questions.
0.800000	From my experience with doctors, they have been trustworthy and helpful. They typically run propertests to make sure I'm being diagnosed correctly and proceed to treat me with the proper medication.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because  he has experience  and  document  that he been in that field for a while and have good bed side  manners
0.800000	I think that most primary care physicians have the knowledge to do what is best for their patients.  They care about their patients well being and take this very seriously.
0.880000	"My primary care physician is a very thoughtful doctor.  He listens closely to what I have to say, and thinks about his responses.  He has a lot of experience, and he seems to have a ""conservative"" approach, in that he doesn't immediately jump to an aggressive treatment."
0.600000	I don't distrust them. I place very high trust in them because they have been through years of school so that they can be in a place where they are.
0.800000	because my doctor will always give me choices and will always be honest with me. He will advise me on what to take and what not to take .
0.960000	My PCP takes time with me and asks me lots of questions.  She looks me in the eye and treats me as a person who is intelligent and capable of understanding health information and decisions.  
0.640000	I think most doctors have the best intentions and do truly want to help but I feel like they are put in the position where they are not allowed to give their patients the time they need to in order to do their job thoroughly.
0.520000	I recently switched from my pediatrician to a regular doctor and the general exam was less thorough. I felt that I could say anything and he didn't seem to care.
0.680000	I don't completely distrust the doctor's word. I just believe that things can change for the better quite often through prayer and fasting; believing in God
0.600000	i see my doctor once a year she is very nice and easy to talk to good at having tests down and prescribes the medications i need
0.880000	doctor seems competent, will answer any questions i have and usually explain things before i need them to be explained. very detailed and always up to date on task
0.680000	I really like my doctor but I do find her rude at times and it is apparent when she is having a stressful day. Unfortutely a few months ago my summary of my doctors visit was given to another patient. The visit was incredibly persol and I was horrified. I have lost a fair amount of trust at the office since.
0.600000	he ahs experience and doesn't lecture just tells it like it is and lets the chips fall where they may and the consequences of such actions.
0.720000	My physician is very nice and relaxed, he's open to talk and laugh. He is very thorough, even to the point that he wants to schedule so many tests that I'm the one who says no. My only problem is there is only limited time with him, instead there are 4 other assistants or nurses who come before and after him for different purposes and they all come and go quickly
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because he takes time to listen to me and order tests and ask questions in return to make sure that he fully understands my problems and how to go about treating me.
0.880000	We have a great relationship where he fields my questions appropriately. He also understands my background when giving explations.
0.640000	I feel that my doctor looks out for my best interests. She gives me advice when I ask . Tells me what I need to do to feel better .
0.240000	I've had so many doctors that simply do not care about their patients, do not explain risks in procedures or medications. The latest doctor I had gave me extremely powerful drugs without explaining their side effects and effectively crippled me (ruined the tendons in my legs).
0.680000	I trust my primary care physcian because we have a strong relationship when it comes down to my health.
0.600000	I would hope they was tell me the truth about everything 
0.520000	I trust my doctor to make the right decisions based on their training and knowledge but doctors are human and still make mistakes
0.600000	I have felt rushed in the examition room, even though my doctor was kind. I was also prescribed something and told it wouldn't affect my mood at all. In fact it made me extremely anxious, and the research I did on my own, after the fact, cautioned that it would.
0.600000	I am kind of in the middle on this. I neither trust or distrust. I believe that my doctor might not be able to devote as much time to my health as is necessary to make the best health decisions possible. 
0.520000	I think that pharmaceutical companies have an unethical amount of control over doctors prescriptions and treatment methods for patients and most people are not inclined to bite the hand that feeds.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he is dealing with someone's health and helping them survive.  Doctors want to help people that's whey they become doctors and why they are committed.
0.960000	I trust my DR as he is always kind and asks all the right questions and spends time with me also I never call unless I am really sick and he always sees me the same day
0.520000	I have always felt rushed and just another number when going to the doctor. I have also been shamed by a few doctors for carrying some extra weight. Overweight people know they are heavy and need kind and conpassiote care, not being lectured to. 
0.720000	I have somewhat trustworthy of my doctor  I know my body more often than she does cause I don't she but once out  the year and my test 
0.880000	I trust my doctor to give me the right advice concerning my health and give me information on how to take better care of myself. 
0.480000	I have Type 2 diabetes and I know that my condition is not as serious as everybody else since every time I'm eating a healthy diet, my numbers stay stable and I would feel great. My doctor keeps trying to push insulin to me even though, I know I don't need it. She even mentioned that they are normally told by their providers to try to offer insulin more towards patients. They try to restrict my refills for a diabetic medicine that I normally need just so that they could make me come in and so that they can charge my insurance company. They won't give me refills until I check-in with them, which for something standard like Diabetes, I don't think I need.
0.640000	I trust doctors in general, but sometimes if the place is busy I might feel like they don't care very much about me but more about moving to the next person. I don't like it when doctors don't seem to care about a more persol engagement.
0.600000	I can't really say that I trust or distrust my doctor. Sometimes I feel like she's doing everything she should and giving me all the information I need but other times it feels like she doesn't hear all the information I give her to give an accurate diagnosis or information I need.
0.800000	I do trust my doctor because she is extremely honest with me and patient with me. She is still new to me since I have had her for 6 months but I already trust her 
0.720000	I mostly trust my doctors to tell me what is wrong and how to fix it; they don't always agree with me or me them when diagnosing something or trying to get me to take pills or treatments I don't want to take or do. I believe they are genuinely trying to help me, but we don't always agree.
0.800000	i have him for over 30 years and he has always take great care of me and my family. seen me through a lot
0.840000	I believe that for the most part, doctors have their patient's best interests in mind. I think it is somewhat uncommon for doctors to be more concerned about what is best or more convenient for themselves.
0.480000	I don't have complete trust in my doctor. He is smart and he cares, but he's been wrong too many times and I've had to look elsewhere for answers. I've figured out things on my own that he couldn't after several visits.
0.480000	Doctors are fallible human beings, no different than you or I and they can, and do make mistakes.  What is in their best interest may not be in yours as well.
0.720000	I have been seeing the same family care physician since I was born so I have come to trust him. However, I do feel that every doctor has their own way of thinking that might be different from my way of thinking. 
0.680000	I trust him to an extent, I mean i do go to him because he knows more about my body and what could be wrong with it, however he is pretty fresh out of school so he still lacks experience.
1.000000	My doctor spends the time with me to not only get to know me but II know what my concerns are and delves into things that could be harmful to me and make sure that don't have things negative to my health that can't be seen on the surface
0.400000	I've had a really devastating loss because my doctor suck. Or it's all my fault, and my body is just terrible. I really don't want to think about it, honestly.
0.760000	I have had a lot of changes with my primary care physician so I cannot always trust that the doctor I saw the last time will be the same doctor I see the next time, but the doctor that I have currently been seeing I have much trust in. 
0.600000	Ive always had a no so trusting feelings with pysicians. They could be being honest or they could be untruthful. I like to get multiple opionions before just accepting one. So im a bit skeptical at times. i think they put there selves first most 
0.800000	my doctor have decades of experience and it great at treating me correctly and with the right medication
0.560000	I believe my doctor does the best he can under the time constraints he has because he does see so many patients. He will suggest a treatment that has worked for most of his patients. If that fails to help, he is open to trying other treatment plans. My lack of complete trust is due to my doctor's limited time to spend with each patient. 
0.480000	I do not feel like my doctor is committed to getting me the best treatment. I like my doctor but I don't think that she views me as much else than an insurance claim.
0.640000	they are giving me the right meds that are gettig my body back to where it needs t help and helpi me to feel better
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because they are experienced and very caring. MY physician takes the time to explain all the possible procedures and how they will effect my outcome. My physician from day one has spent ample time with we talking and understanding my needs and concerns
0.760000	I think most doctors are out to help you. There are some money hungry ones who just want to earn as much as possible and do not care much about you, but all in all, I think most doctors generally care about their patients. 
0.760000	I have no primary care doctor since the doctors I have seen in the past didn't seem to believe me in what I said about my condition and also I have gotten into arguments with them that left me in tears
0.800000	I have been with my same doctor for years. During this time, from my impression, my doctor has always been honest and forthright with me. My doctor's actions and behavior has never given me any reason to distrust him. Therefore, until I am given a reason, I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
0.840000	I trust her.. cause Ive had other doctors.. and shes now a female which und erstands my needs alittle better... and always gives me her open and honest opinion.. 
0.560000	She put me on a medication and took me off another cold turkey and I developed serotonin syndrome which has completely turned my life upside down.
0.760000	I do not distrust my primary care physician. I have no reason not to trust her by any means. I trust her completely. 
0.920000	Though I think my doctor may make some choices that are easier for him, I know he is a well respected and good doctor. He is published many times so I generally trust what he has to say and am confident in his choices and actions.
0.720000	I trust my PCP because she tells it like it is. I have met doctors before who cautiously agree with whatever the patient says, because maybe they don't want to alienate or be subject to poor reviews. But my internist is very candid.
0.720000	I've seen them multiple times and they have been kind and straight forward each visit. There have been other times where a doctor has made snide remarks about something u weight for example) and I couldn't wait to get out of there.
0.640000	It it their job and I like to believe they have moral standards and wouldnt sway me towards something wrong.
1.000000	Our family has been going to the same doctor for 25 years, we trust him very much. He takes time and explains everything.
1.000000	I have had the same doctor that my dad has been using.  She has been our family doctor for 20 years, and really helped a lot in some trying times.  She is simply the best.
0.920000	She has been thorough with my care and has earned my trust. Most doctors have not been able to do that. 
0.840000	I have been seeing my current doctor for 10 years.  She is honest with her opinions,  takes tine to see how you are feeling.  Compassionate,  good bedside manner,  approachable 
0.800000	My doctor knows more than I do.  If I didn't want to trust my doctor I wouldn't go to see him.  He has the education and experience to make the decisions that are more accurate than I can get from a Google search
0.600000	I have found in the past with primary care physicians I've had that they are interested in providing me with prescriptions I don't need and calling it preventative. 
0.760000	I trust them most of the time but I tend to not rely too much on their answers when it comes to what medicines to prescribe. I was told by another physician that many doctors have contracts with certain pharmaceutical companies, and because of this they are persuaded to recommend that company's medications, even though they know it won't fix their pain or conditions. Since they have a contract, they are forced to push the company they have a contract with's products over others. 
1.000000	I have been seeing this doctor for over 12 years and he has always been honest with me. I know my welfare is his top concern and he has always taken very good care of me and health issues that may arise.
0.720000	My primary care physician has taken an interest in my health and well being and has shown herself to be someone who has my interests in mind. She is caring and trustworthy.
0.840000	My primary care physician is thoughtful and absolutely does his best to give good advice.  At the end of the day, though, medical decisions are my decision, and  I need to do my own thinking and research about serious conditions.
0.800000	For the most part I trust my doctor. They have always been honest with me and see to take the time to explain the problems that I have. There have been times where I asked a million questions and they are more than happy to answer. My daughters doctor is a little different. They always seem to be in a rush. 
0.600000	I trust that they will tell me what they think. However, I'm not always convinced that they're up to date on the very latest options. I also think they sometimes omit borderline information (i.e., risks or treatments that are on the extreme ends of the normal bell curve) just out of the sake of time. I generally trust them, as far as it goes, though.
0.560000	Nobody knows me or my body better than me. No degree or amount of years in school can make anybody the person who knows me better.
0.600000	i do not completely trust my doctor a lot of the times because she do not do thorough physical she is more of a laptop doctor
0.680000	He does listen to me and give me suggestions to solve a problem (see another doctor, specialist) but never has the answer himself.
0.800000	My primary care physician was extremely amiable. Even if we were not dealing with something that was quite within the realm of his expertise (such as my anxiety) he would recommend literature I could read on the subject.  He would never fail to ask follow-up questions about things I'd experienced in a previous appointment with him. 
0.640000	I don't know if physicians as a group necessarily know or care about giving their patients the best care.
0.720000	No matter how disinterested my doctors have seemed sometimes, I still have faith in their expertise to provide me with the right evaluations. Even though you get treated like a piece of furniture in healthcare clinics, the doctors are still good.
0.560000	I have many doctors and some I agree some I feel try's real hard some I feel is in it for the money and one I feel knows me for she sees herself in me
0.920000	my doctor is open, honest, tell it like it is, what the expected results should be; the cost, the reason for the prescription, etc.
0.800000	I think they want to help people .That's what they went to school and training for. So, I trust that they know what they're doing and can make the best decisions.
0.800000	I feel like if they have been through so much schooling, I should trust them as long as they keep up with new medical findings.
0.800000	My primary care physician seems genuine and thoughtful. She listens to all  my questions and never seems to be in a rush. She seems thorough in her examination and is kind.
1.000000	My docotor is an amazing woman and she helps me all the time when I'm sick and also gives me advise to walk in her shoes 
0.840000	I trust doctors because ultimately, I visit them because I'm not an expert in regards to health and medicine and because they have the means to help me. They're the ones with the expert knowledge. If I do think that they're doing something questionable, I would consult yet another doctor. Furthermore, doctors tend to be high on empathy and people who study this career did it because they wanted to, no one forced them to do it. I think this makes them more trustworthy.
0.760000	My issue is less a trust of the doctor themselves, and more of an institutionalization of thought. There are other ways to heal/treat people than what is typically catered to in a hospital, although a Doctor may not always be aware of them.
0.640000	I distrust doctors because they work for big companies and the companies are in it to make money therefore the doctors have to find a way to make that money.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel that doctors have too close of a relationship with drug manufacturers and this causes them to push certain medications on you when you could possible solve a health problem by changing certain habits.
0.760000	My doctor know more than me, he is the expert so I trust him completly over what I googled or found on med md, he went to school for this.
0.360000	He tells me what I need to hear instead of what I want to hear.he is also very cautious and careful about administering medication that is not needed.
0.720000	I TRUST MY DOCTOR THAT SHE WILL ALWAYS GIVE ME THE CORRECT INFORMATION EVEN IF I DON'T WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE IS SAYING.
0.640000	I believe mu doctor is too set in her own opinions, and reluctant to support my wishes which are based on my experience with previous doctors.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because they are well studied in the medical field for treating me and providing prescriptions.They have a lot at risk if they don't provide the right information.
0.680000	I don't have a primary care physician so when I do go to the doctor for things a lot of times I get different responses. That puts a lot of lack of faith in me with them because of that. It almost seems like they are guessing to what is wrong with me so really when I go for an issue I have, I am really just going for the meds that I know gets rid of the inflammation and infection I get.
0.560000	 I do not completely trust my primary physician because he does not listen to me well enough. He is quick to assert his opinion and kind of ignores mine since I am less knowledgeable.
0.640000	They are more concerned with co-pay and treating a problem versus curing the problem. My insurance only covers a small portion of the bills and it is difficult to get solutions.
0.800000	I trust her because she is amazing and listens to me about my concerns without judgement. I can always get good answers that are thorough and explained 
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he is a family friend. He would tell me the truth about whatever I see him for. I believe he would anyways because it is not worth it for him to lie to anyone. There is so much information out there that doctors can quickly be checked if they are not telling the truth or are incompetent. 
0.800000	He is thorough and answers questions also personally calls  with test results Will take time to explain tests ordered and why. Always feel he has time to listen appointments are never rushed
0.760000	I have trust in my primary care physician because is always straight forward and makes an effort to guide me to make good decisions and helps me weigh all different options that I have.
0.720000	they know better than me, they have experience in health issue , so I have to trust them, every day they can have new cases about people so they can understand quickly what the patient feel and need
0.520000	I trust them, but there are times when they rush things and I'm left wondering if they were caring about me at all.
0.760000	I trust my doc because he really listen to what i am saying and looks out for my well being. When I am sick he gets me into his office in a timely manner.
0.720000	I trust that my physician because I feel like they have my best interest at heart and would guide me in the best direction for my health
0.840000	I have been seeing my doctor for a couple of years and she is thorough and trusting.  She is always ready to listen to my concerns.  She addresses preventative medicine with a passion.
0.680000	I trust my pcp because she always take time to make sure I understand and really explains all my options and possible outcomes. 
0.640000	There might be lots of factors why a primary care physician make certain decisions. There could be influence from the practice to meet a certain quota when invoicing. Drug companies often have 'agreements' with practices so their products are preferred in the treatment of certain conditions. Sometimes practitioners are under time constraints so may opt to try a treatment for something non-life threatening and recheck later to assess response
0.280000	I distrust the medical profession because it is one solely funded by and has become the face of big pharma, who pushes its poisonous pills via sales bonuses to doctors who write a certain number of scripts. The medical profession as it stands is a front for the biggest drug cartel that is responsible for more deaths than any other, the fda and big pharma  
0.720000	My doctor has a proven track record with myself and my mother.  He gives very thoughtful consultations and does not rush our visits.
0.560000	Being in an HMO I feel cost concerns sometimes trump procedures that should be done Doctor sometimes seems rushed and spends too much time on his computer instead of talking to me.
0.720000	I trust doctors to a certain extent. although sometimes I feel as if I need a second opinion depending on the situation. 
0.800000	I didn't have a primary doctor for quite a while because I didn't think I really needed one.  I had to get a referral to see a neurologist, so I saw one recently for that.  She was so nice and made me feel very comfortable.  She compared some digestive issues that I'm having to problems that her daughter is having and gave me good advice on solving the problem. She seemed very down to earth and trustworthy.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to talk to me about all aspects of my health, and helps me look into a multitude of treatment options, where applicable. He is very experienced, and takes the time to listen to me (which can be rare in doctors). I get the feeling that my family's and my own health are important to him.
0.840000	i don't know yet. Not so sure what to do but, I'll keep trying the best I can. Maybe things will get better sooner or later.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because of the treatment and the way my doctor explain things to me. Also because of the way that we talk about things that we have in common.
0.600000	I trust doctors as they know what physical conditions I may have and have often been truthful to me.
1.000000	I have been under the care of my primary physician for over 10 years and I have complete trust and faith in him and his clinic staff.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because my questions are always answered. I feel like I. Always taken seriously no matter the situation.  When something is wrong he always goes above and beyond to figure out whatâs the matter. I always feel like I can open up about whatâs wrong and not feel embarrassed. 
0.720000	i trust my doctor because i i didn't i would not go to her. i am comfortable with her and i know she has my best interest at heart
0.920000	He was my father doctor. He talks to me. He send me to do lab work. He explains problems. He read my sugar books.
0.760000	I switched doctors within the program I am enrolled in. The first doctor was not a good fit - I never felt at ease around her and doubted her expertise. My new doctor is much easier to talk to but one must be on one's toes when meeting with him. All-in-all I find it much easier to talk to him. Sometimes I have to ask for clarification as to the why or details but he will usually explain things to my satisfaction.
0.600000	At the moment I do not have a doctor.  The one I went to for many years retired a few years ago.  I have not needed one since that time.
0.760000	"I have a long standing relationship with my primary care doctor.   He ""gets"" me and knows how much to push if extra treatment is involved."
0.960000	It is very reliable since my whole family goes with it. Makes his job perfect, is an honest, responsible, caring and professional person. So I fully rely on your capabilities.
0.480000	I really have little experience with my primary physician, one incident that stands out is her interpretation of an x-ray when I injured my ankle.  Upon viewing it she decided that there was no fracture, when we looked at it together I thought there looked to be a small fracture - she insisted that what I saw was a vein.  Later that evening I received a call from the radiologist who had reviewed my x-rays and he confirmed that there was a fracture.
0.600000	I sometimes don't trust my doctor because of her negative reviews that are public on Google. However she is usually kind to me and tries to suggest what her opinions are rather than making it sound like that's absolutely the problem. She tends to prescribe me something to see if it helps and tells me to come back at a later date if the problem still persists. 
0.560000	I do not know my current PCP well.  She is the 3rd PCP I have had in as many years. One doctor retired and the next one moved to an employee health position.Once I get to know a doctor and they get to know me we can work together equally to give me a positive outcome.  I have been on Medicare less than a year.  There are many changes in what a physician is allowed to prescribe for different parameters.  Each stage of life has it's own learning curb.
0.960000	He spends alot of time with me & is very thorough & explains everything. He takes the time to listen to me.
0.400000	Not too sure, but I feel that doctors will give their patients false information just to hurry up and get them out just to get to the next patients. But I think they care to a certain extent .
0.840000	Doctors seeing lower income people don't get reimbursed well. Medi-Cal reimbusement rates are dismal and doctors aren't getting paid to see these patients. This means less doctors come to the area and we don't have a wide enough incentive to bring in high quality doctors or even keep them well paid or keep their buildings looking nice. Their surroundings seem lower tier and they often have too many patients since there aren't enough doctors. The doctors I've seen required travel. If a doctor gets recommended by someone else, I'm more trusting of the doctor. While there are some red flags to some people, I've never had an issue with an doctor at a clinic or a big hospital. They've always been able to guide me to a solution.
0.200000	"For one, I don't have insurance and live well below the poverty level, so I don't have a PCP. Medical care is in an emergency only. But, when I did have a PCP and insurance, my doctors were in the room for 5 minutes or less and just gave a dx as whatever was the fastest and most convenient thing at the time. Also, I have a mental health history, so anything they couldn't explain or dx, they just attributed to me being ""mentally unstable""."
0.800000	When I go see my primary physician it seem that he is always looking out for me . When I ask question he effectively answers them and provides many solutions to the problem I go in for.  
0.920000	I trust my doctor since i have enough time dealing with him and also i entrust is to my family and my friens and colleagues
0.640000	distrust has been established due to a mutual disrespect amongst myself and the non-medical personnel that staff the doctors office. As they seem to believe that they are well aware of how to treat me and better capable of handling it than I. 
0.760000	I trust her because she is very professiol and through with everything. I have had her for several years and always glad to see her
0.560000	I feel that the business side of things makes it really hard for doctor and care give to give the best service as possible. I think they are push to see you longer then they need to and add on service that you really don't need. I think that they are good people but I think that management get to involved in health care.
0.800000	I trust doctors because they have the training and education and I do not. They understand what is happening to body and know what the best treatment will be. 
0.640000	If I didn't trust them I would stay home. Ginger!
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to what I have to say and thoroughly explains whatever I do not understand. I trust his opinion and I feel like he cares about me as a patient.
0.960000	I thinks he cares about his patients and he knows what's he doing. He has helped me many times and I trust him
0.760000	They know more than i do, but i always do some research for myself to see if i'm in close range to what they are thinking 
0.720000	My doctor and my health care plan have a very good reputation. Therefore, I am trusting them for my Healthcare needs.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician as they have done a really good job of diagnosing me and getting me the care I need so far. They have helped direct me to people that were able to help me with things that they were not trained to do (specialists) and in a very short amount of time. They have been able to help me with my scoliosis and have always been very positive. 
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician based on the relationship that developed.  She discusses the latest information.  She is also an instructor. 
0.720000	My doctor comes to my home for our visits because i can talk with her in a more friendly atmosphere then an office visit Which i feel i get to know her better and able to trust her more 
0.800000	I trust my doctor to treat what symptoms I have explained to him but sometimes I do not know how to explain my symptoms and will have to make a couple of trips to the doctor's office to get the correct diagnosis. 
0.920000	My doctor is very trustable because he takes his time with me and cares about me getting better when im ill. I have no reason to distrust him with all he does for me. Hes the best at what he does.
0.760000	I trust doctors to tell me about my health condition.  I like asking doctors questions.  I follow doctors decisions about being healthy.
0.640000	My doctor told me to stop asking questions about medications and just trust her. I did not think that was a good answer.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. However in the modern world, science is just one more are of Leftist rrative making. I am mindful when researching that doctors and scientists have an agenda which is certainly not truth. For example: Climate Science, Bill Nye, Neil Tyson, when people talk about settled science I laugh at their retardation and misunderstanding.
0.720000	"i dont really distrust him, i've gotta bad bumpy past & he holds it against me, i really should go & find a new doctor, other than that he's a ""ok"" doctor"
0.640000	I trust my physician because they have all the resources to handle my situations but they are not perfect so I do not completely depend on them to be honest and correct about everything.
0.560000	I think it all comes down to certain situations on how much you get out of your doctor, if it's right before they're leaving they're going to rush and just say what's convenient even if it's not 100% accurate. If they've had a good weekend and i'm the first person than there's a good chance i'm going to receive everything I should get on any time.
0.840000	I trust my doctor , If I distrust my doctor I will replaced him. I think he take care about my health
0.880000	I trust ny doctor to a certain extent, where I am comfortable  with my doctor and can tell if they are telling me bull and if they real care about my health and want to provide the info I need to keep my self in great health.
0.680000	I am cautiously trusting of my doctor's care for me, following up with questions if there are areas I feel she has not covered or been as thorough as needed. 
0.680000	My family doctor is not always aware of the latest medications for my condition.  I must sometimes suggest to her the meds that I am aware of.
0.560000	In some ways I feel they push drugs on you because they get a cut of it.  Some doctors just rush though with you and move onto the next patient for money.  
0.800000	I have been with my doctor for many years; we trust each other and work well together, also have mutual respect
0.880000	I am uninsured and haven't seen a doctor for 14 months. When I do, I like my doctor very much. He is thoughtful and attentive, speaks in normal civilian language, not medical terms I can't understand. He takes all of the time I need.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician. Because he take time to explain all the medical condition and sends me to specialist physician if needed. And he explain the medication very well.
0.800000	My family doctor is a very thorough, personal doctor overall. He takes the time to know each of our health conditions and how to best maintain or improve our health conditions.
0.520000	In my experience my doctor only gives bad news or the worst of what can happen. He dosnt give you any hope in healing things or being able to fi anything
0.800000	My Doctor explains everything to me, sometimes I do not grasps everything but if it is put in his notes I can look it up. If I need to see him he will see me but I will have to wait to be squeezed between appointments of other people. 
0.800000	I have been seeing my doctor for years and they always seem to be able to fix my problem and seem concerned about my well being.  I have trust that they will continue to fix and help my issues as they arise.
0.680000	My doctor is great and I trust him and his judgement. However, I always verify things for myself and do my own research as my doctor can never have the knowledge of my health history that I do - so he might miss something. 
0.600000	I don't trust doctors in general. I do not feel that doctors in these days and times actually have a passion for the job as they use to. It is now just a form of financial gain.
0.480000	"I usually have to see a doctor at the E.R. because I have no insurance, so I tend to feel they obviously won't have anything ""persolly invested"" in me as an individual. I think sometimes they just do whatever gets me out of there the fastest, whatever treatment is easiest and quickest. I usually have to remind them to try to keep my lack of income in mind when writing prescriptions and such. This being said, if it is an issue that does not directly involve mental health or drug addiction (these are areas I am knowledgeable about because I have issues relating to these areas), i.e., if it is something I probably don't know much about, I generally trust the doctor because they obviously were smart enough to make it through medical school."
0.760000	I have had my doctor for a long time and she knows my history well. She also knows I prefer tural treatments and to monitor things instead of masking with pills etc. Because we have established a good rapport I do trust her when I need to make decisions about my health.
0.680000	If I didn't trust my family physician, I would not continue to visit his office.  I have been blessed with very good health (no major illnesses, never had to take prescription medicines at age 76) so it is difficult to judge my family physician as to trust or not. 
0.800000	I generally trust my doctor's years of expertise and practice in the medical field. However, I also know that medicine is not a precise science and that there is still much that is not known about health conditions that afflict the human body. I know that there is always some chance that I may be misdiagnosed no matter how experienced my doctor is. However, overall I feel that my doctor has the wherewithal and the knowledge to give me the treatment that I require. My doctor shows compassion and concern when I visit her and has always answered my questions with clarity.
0.880000	I generally trust my doctor as they have gone to medical school and see many things that make it so they learn a great deal. At the same time I do like to look into things myself. I'm not one that likes to take medications that have side effects and care a great deal about knowing what I'm dealing with medically.
0.800000	I have had the same doctor for many years. He has always been upfront with me and what my options were for that particular ailment.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because I have seen the same one for twenty years. He has always been very thorough for regarding any issue that I have. During my pregnancies he was never too pushy about what he thought was best, and let me make the decisions. He is always a good listener when it comes to my concerns, and never rushes me out of his office. 
0.960000	My primary care physician suggests what is best for me.  They have never steered me wrong in the time that I've been seeing them.
0.960000	This specialist has been my doctor for fours.  I have multiple medical issues, all complex.  The doctor has a very high knowledge of the diagnosis and treatments, and gives me all the options.  I trust this doctor very much
0.840000	My primary care physician spends a good amount of time with me when I see him. He tells me about condition and how I can continue having good health. 
0.600000	I trust my doctor will listen and provide adequate care. However sometimes i feel like they need pushing in the right direction or motivation to provide the care. Sometimes I think it's easier for them to avoid a situation so they don't have to deal with it.
0.560000	I trust him generally because he does help me a lot. but at the end of the day it is a profession and he needs to make money so sometimes i feel he is in a rush to get to the next patient. that could just be me though also he seems to quick to prescribe meds
0.760000	After speaking with several primary care physicians, I have concluded that this group generally cares deeply about patients and acts in their best interests. I believe doctors make mistakes or seem cold sometimes because of work pressure and empathy fatigue.
0.880000	I trust Dr. Baldridge because I think she is truly concerned about me and my health.  She goes above and beyond what she has to do to see that I am getting the best care.
0.640000	Because it seen that you have to take the doctor words for it when you bearly can trust them that's why it hard for me to just up and go when they won't ask about if okay or nkt
0.560000	I canât say that I have complete trust in my doctor. I know my doctor cares to talk me through my concerns and issues but there have been times that I have felt that my doctor was not as talkative or seemed to be in a hurry more than other times. My doctor has at times discussed different things to try for me and told me the good and bad about the treatments and Iâve never felt that she tried to push anything on me just explaining the benefits and so forth and let me take it from there.
0.760000	"I do not have a primary care physician, however, I did have to go to a doctor recently (possible kidney stones). He was a good doctor who, although busy, took the time to listen to my concerns and symptoms while keeping a ""playful/positive"" attitude. He treated me as though I was perfectly competent in my descriptions/concerns and, while listening to me describe my symptoms, stated what possible things could be causing my symptoms, and finally what he thought it was most likely to be. He was genuinely concerned about my comfort (I was in extreme pain...but I was a champ) and wanted to make sure the pain levels would be decreased before I left the office. He sent me to another doctor for a CT scan and, after I explained I don't have health insurance, made sure that he found the best payment options/route for what I needed done as opposed to just charging me one set rate. I trusted his opinion and appreciated his compassion and humor. In general, this has been my experience with most doctors...busy, but compassionate."
0.760000	i always trust our primary care physician, they are always helpful and always consider my wants and needs.
0.720000	I trust my Physician's because he's the one that take care of me health-wise, and make sure that I am on the right path and and in good health.
0.560000	I think she is fine. Sometimes rushed or doesnât always listen to what I want or make me feel heard, but does what she can.
0.720000	I mostly trust my physician, however, I am concerned that he is not thorough enough.  I feel as though I have to request standard tests that should be routine for my age.
0.960000	I trust my doctor as he spends all the time I need at every appointment answering questions and explaining all options, side effects and testing results.
0.680000	I trust my OBGYN caregiver because she is always honest and answers any of my questions with not only her professional opinion but based on her experience 
0.960000	My doctor has been right about diagnoses for myself and my husband and treats us with appropriate medications for our needs with few side effects.  I feel I can rely on our doctors' advise and prognosis.
0.720000	Doctors go through so many years of schooling and training and they are so knowledgeable you have to trust them.
0.800000	based on prior diagnosis I and confident in what my doctors provides a treatment or additional test to run
0.680000	I trust my doctor implicitly but he has alot of patients and his time is severely limited with each patient. It's the one thing that annoys me. But he is excellent at his practice even if his time magement is lacking. He still mages to be caring and attentive but the rushing in and out does sometimes give me pause.
0.400000	I haven't had a major sickness that would require me to seek out a new PCP so I've stayed with the one I've had since I was a teeger.  
0.600000	There are two levels of trust I have for a person who is providing me a service. The trust of them as a person and the trust in the service they're providing. I trust must doctors as good people, but that doesn't mean they can't make mistakes or not be adequately informed about something. I may rely on a doctor, but that doesn't mean I trust him or her 100%.
0.480000	I have change doctors in the last 6 months and am just starting to get to know them and what what type of caring person and how they work with me and the staff they have in the office. I do know they the few time I have been in the office I was not to draw in to this doctor, but mt dealing with the staff has been great they call back within a good time frame and have been very helpful with what I may need at that time
0.600000	I usually feel that doctors are in a rush and not always taking the time to get all the information to make a diagnosis or recommend treatment 
0.840000	He is young, enthusiastic and comes from a family of doctors. He's thorough and listens..he takes time to go over questions.
1.000000	My doctor has on multiple occasions spent more time with me than she had to to make sure I'm content or that she figures out what proper course of action is. If she doesn't know something she tells me and then seeks out other sources of information to help her make an informed decision.
0.240000	I distrust my because we would rather save money and resources. rather than try and help my illness and or bodily dysfunction.
0.640000	hes old school and knowledgeable.  tells it straight and doesn't lecture. been helpful and clear in explanations.
0.520000	Do not always feel he is listening, but he does often get back to me after investigating certain things.
0.920000	She is thorough open and honest.  She believes in God and listens to me when I talk. She responds to my questions and never seems rushed 
0.800000	I definitely trust my physician in the sense that they are well trained  and belief they are competent
0.960000	I trust my ankle surgeon because he actually screwed up a surgery.  It was not something he did as much as my body reacted poorly to the procedure.  He went step by step with me as to how to fix the problem and what lingering issues I would have.  He is always up front and direct but polite with me. 
0.640000	I trust my doctor but I feel like I'm certain situations like if I had cancer or something serious, I would look into my options.
0.800000	all doctors are not created equal; some are better than other my own doctor is very trust worthy i completely  trust him
0.720000	Because my doctor asks what medications I need. He knows I do my research. My doctor knows that I am a therapist.
0.760000	I like my doctor to take their time and sometimes that doesn't happen.  But, she does what she can.  She answers questions and perscribes what is needed.  
0.840000	its not all bout that not at all.living life an leaenng helpin others an others helpin you don't matter no u wont find
0.720000	They do have more schooling then I do and they continue to learn about different diseases and treatments. The one's I have seen pretty much put everything straight out there for you, they don't dance around the subjects and the sometimes admit they don't know what's wrong instead of just trying to label you and move you along. 
0.360000	I don't currently have a primary care physician. My last one, who I'd see once a year for a basic check-in and a prescription refill for my anti-anxiety med, told me last year not to come back anymore because I'm uninsured (stuck in a state-caused ACA loophole) and can't afford more in-depth exams. Being told something like that kind of dented my trust in medical professiols in general.
0.680000	Well I'm more so neutral because I have new physician due to living in a college town while attending.  I've only had to go to her so far for a health check up for insurance purposes.  I had nothing wrong with me so there wasn't any real medical needs present at that time.
0.840000	I have been seeing my primary care physician for about 10 years now, I have full and complete trust in him.  He is very proactive with my health and he does not always recommend using medicine.  
0.640000	That is hard to answer with any amount of certainty as my primary doctor has just retired and I have only had one contact with my new doctor.  That appointment went satisfactory -  but don't know the whole picture.
0.640000	I only trust my doctors to a certain extent due to the fact that they too, are human and can make mistakes and or give false or inaccurate information.
0.520000	I trust them because I have been with them since I was a kid. However, their practices seem a little bit outdated compared to others.
0.200000	I have complete distrust for doctors in general. Some things are not thoroughly explained to where I can understand what options I have in regards to making the right decision for my health. My former OBGYN sped through his answers every time I asked him a question. It's like a didn't have time to think or make a decision. I was trying to decide what my best option is for birth control and at the end of the day I ended up not making a decision. I was so upset with my whole visit with the doctor in general that I have to choose another OBGYN. I was actually referred to the former OB. I waited like 30 mins to see the doctor and when I finally seen the doctor the visit was like 5 seconds. I had some questions and concerns and he just breezed over his answers 
0.680000	I trust my physician to give me accurate medical information since he is the expert in this field. My doctor is competent and kind.
0.680000	My primary care physician is more interested in prescribing medication rather than preventative care. I feel like all he ever wants to do is give me some drug other than give me better life habit talks.
0.480000	Its not so much a matter of Trust or Mistrust.  It's not black and white like that.  Its about enhancing and verifying information.  Just because I verify a doctors findings through my own research doesn't mean I do not trust them.  I'm um....Intuitive.
0.920000	i trust my primary physician because she listens to what I have to say and we decide the treatment that fits me best.  She does not make me feel that she is rushed.
0.600000	I trust my doctor but i also have a mind of my own and follow my intuition. My doctor is very caring and informative.
0.800000	I trust them because she's nice and cares for me. she makes me feel safe and helps me take care of myself and makes sure i do good and stuff and also she offers candy. she's really caring and generous 
0.760000	sometimes i feel like my doctor prescribes medicine unnecessarily just to pacify me. but he does ask a lot of questions and try to be as thorough as possible and refers me to a specialist when he's unsure of my condition.
0.760000	I don't have any concerns with my dr. But sometimes it does make you wonder if the decisions that your doctor has made for you is correct
0.640000	My doctor most of the time so thins in my favor she make sure I do ever text she ask me to do and do follow up on my med
0.680000	I feel doctors are trustworthy in the fact that too many people are sue happy. So if the doctor does something that people can sue and get easy money they will. So in my opinion doctors need to be careful and be trusting all at the same time
0.800000	I mostly trust my doctor. He seems like a nice and caring guy and very thorough. I haven't been seeing him long, but I think he does a good job and is very attentive. 
0.680000	I haven't been with my primary care physician for a long time so I can't say I completely trust them. 
0.680000	Sometimes they don't listen to everything I need to tell them, and they come to a conclusion/diagnosis before I tell them everything I'm experiencing. Sometimes I'm left with some concerns. However, I generally trust their judgment.
0.880000	She is always there for me. She lets me know important information about my health. She answers all my questions with patience.
0.800000	I have a long-standing patient/doctor relationship with my doctor. She is trustworthy and thorough, and always takes time to ask me in-depth questions and relate to me on a human level.
0.920000	I have had my primary physician for 20 plus years. During that time he has always listened to my concerns, shared his concerns and always made the correction decisions to improve my various health issues. He is kind and considerate and truly cares about mew and his other patients
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I feel their goal is to keep me as healthy as possible. Their advice that they give me is the best that is for me in that particular situation, not the best for them.
0.680000	I trust my doctor because he is a smart, competent person who is not in a rush and cares about providing my good advice and counsel.  But I also realize that there are limits to his experience and knowledge and he rarely runs tests to understand the problems.  So yes, I trust that he isn't lying but I don't always believe that he is correct.
1.000000	My doctor truly have my best interest at heart. She takes her time to explain everything. She goes over & beyond.
0.720000	I haven't seen my primary care doctor all that often and usually when I do it's for pretty straight for things such as a broken arm or a physical. In other words, it's hard for me to quantify my trust in my doctor because I've never been put in a situation where trust can be questioned.
0.920000	we have a young, enthusiastic doctor who comes from a family of doctors; he listens to me. Since I do a lot of research on medical issues, I feel he is giving me correct information.
0.560000	I trust them to a certain extent, but I know they are influenced by Big Pharma, and are reluctant to tell you about natural, effective treatment, and will probably try to get you on some type of prescription that you may or may not need.  In many cases these drugs can do more harm than good.
0.720000	I feel they have a lot of knowledge and this is their expertise.  I also feel like my doctor tries to get to know me. 
0.600000	I trust doctors I general to a degree, but often I think they are too overbooked to provide the attention most patients need or would like. I think they check symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and a treatment plan, but don't stick around to fully answer patients questions. I feel like a wait around for the doctor and then am rushed once they arrive.
0.400000	I dont disturst him, but I also dont completely trust him..  Dovtors do not know you from one visit to the next.
0.840000	He is very reassuring and steered me in better directions than previous doctors.  He's up front and honest about every option.
0.600000	some doctor's quite honestly are pharma shills. they are paid to pump a new drug under strict contract. and they become blinded by the money perks over the patient care.
0.600000	"My primary care physician is ""new"" (at least to me) and a bit young and naÃ¯ve. She knows practically nothing about diabetes, yet tries to micro-manage me and my condition, never understanding why her methods of treatment aren't working well. Thought my Endocrinologist and I had finally gotten my primary care doctor ""out of the picture,"" then she reared her ugly head again. Now I'm again faced with having to satisfy BOTH of them!"
1.000000	My doctor takes my concerns seriously. In fact, I had a problem with itching during my pregncy. The nurse line told me that it was in my head and to just deal with it. When I mentioned it to my doctor, she immediately ran tests and diagnosed me with a condition that required me to be induced right away, as it could have resulted in my baby being stillborn. The fact that she took my concerns seriously over something as small as itchy hands and feet shows she cares.
0.760000	Sometimes I suspect if the doctor is looking for his own benefit rather than the patient's benefit, as it happens a lot. for example, advising for a surgery while it is not necessary or a very little benefit will result out of it.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he has always been able to treat and cure any ailment that I present to him.  I always wonder if he (or any doctor) is sometimes motivated to recommend treatments that are fincially beneficial to him, however.  I don't believe my doctor has done that with me, but it is always in the back of my mind.
0.960000	I feel based on the information in front of them they make the best decision possible.  I think if they do not know they are at least diligent about sending you onto a specialist, or double checking things like lab work, etc. to rule things out and make sure nothing serious is going on.
0.520000	I feel like now days, doctors are in a rush to get patients out of the office, and not so interested in what is going on with the patient, only what they think or the easiest way to get the patient to leave.
0.760000	i trust them because i have used them for years and they have no reason to be dishonest to me
0.280000	Doctors only alot a certain amount of time for each patient (not long enough) causing them to rush through your visit with very little time to explain what's wrong with you let alone explain different procedures or treatment options.  Doctors also almost always jump to a pill, or a test or a procedure rather than trying a more down to earth, logical approach.
0.520000	Don't always spend enough time or ask if you have any questions. Just want to get you in and out. Therefore how can one totally trust if they don't get to know you as a person.
0.480000	I think in many occassions this is a result of a bad system. I have yet to see a real benefit for a physician to make me healthy. In most cases the physician is looking to see me, diagnose me, treat me, and get me out the door in a short window. With this model there is very little time to have a real conversation about me and my overall health.  
0.600000	I normally trust my doctor, however, I have gotten diabetes and tardive dyskinesia as a result of medications prescribed to me by some of my doctors. For that reason, I don't completely trust doctors.
0.760000	I trust my PCP because she takes the time to listen to my needs and concerns. She takes the time to thoroughly explain my conditions and the medications I'm taking. She has a great bedside manner and is really nice.
0.800000	My doctor never makes me feel rushed. She always makes sure to answer my questions and make me feel involved in deciding my treatment. She makes it seem like we are a team and equals. She tells me about different types of treatments and recommends what will have less strain on my body. 
0.600000	Doctors in general seem to be more jaded with their profession. They seem more concerned with simply medicating and moving patients along rather than spending time to determine what the best course of action is. I have seen it with a lot of doctors as well as vets for animals. It could be because there is an increased number of cases that they process, I'm not sure. But it's alarming.
0.600000	I currently don't have a primary doctor at the moment which is why I documented all neutral. I'm new to the state and have yet to find a doctor I'm comfortable with yet. The last doctor I had in my hometown was my childhood doctor. 
1.000000	I trust my doctors because they've always been honest with me.
0.720000	Not a special reason
0.760000	I've been seeing my PCP mostly for anxiety issues and so because we've talked about the reasons why the anxiety might be happening, she was very understanding and informative.
0.560000	The doctor that I have now pushes the medication option.  My previous doctor did the same.  I know they are doing the basics for me.  But I'm not that good a patient and I don't always follow their orders.
0.680000	I recently switched to a new primary care physician and am working on building trust after a previously bad experience with my former doctor. I also have intense anxiety and distrust in general.
0.800000	I have gone to him for several years.  He tells it like it is, and doesn't sugar coat it.  When I have concerns I bring them to his attention and he discusses it with me.  I'm an overall healthy person, and see him twice per.  If I am in there outside of the every six months, he knows something is really wrong.
0.800000	Because he always seen to know how to treat any illness, or problem that I have, and since I have been seeing my doctor he have never been wrong about any of my health problems that I have had.
0.480000	I don't put too much trust in my doctor and I always research the pills he prescribes me. The reason for this is that I know a lot of big companies offer money to doctors so they prescribe their pills. I've seen few documentaries about it.
0.720000	I've been seeing her awhile. We talk bout things. I just trust her.  She listens to me, we talk about each issue. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician due to actually taking the time to listen to what I am saying and talking with me about what the right path is for me.
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he takes a lot time with every patient to figure out how you are and what is going on.  Willing to give all the tests needed to figure out any issues.
0.640000	"He is knowledgeable, yet I'm unsure if he understands my discomfort. I hope for more of him when I see him. Yet I hear a lot of ""that's normal for you"" when I want him to do something about my symptoms "
0.760000	Although I have only been seeing my current doctor for 6 months, she caught a health issue that made a difference in my life. I trust her to be thorough and give me the care i need. I feel that I need to be with her longer to fully form my opinion, but so far I trust her and believe she is honest. 
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because she listens to every single detail I share with her. Then from there she draws her conclusion. I trust her completely.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he understands my needs and listens to what I am telling him.
0.680000	i trust my primary care physician because i believe they care about me. I believe they want what is best for me.
0.640000	Doctors know more than the low class so they are going to organize and make references to medical advice based on the economy and budget.
0.440000	I persolly have those feelings towards all physicians as well. I also lean more towards altertive medicine.
1.000000	Very good eye contact! Explains things carefully and completely, encourages questions. Not afraid to touch me! Takes his time, not in a rush like an assembly line.
0.680000	It depends on the physician. I've have a few terrible physicians in the past who did nothing to properly evaluate me or show that they are truly professionals. She kind of changed my outlook on a few but using my knowledge in healthcare I learned that I can talk about the signs and symptoms and the possibilities and get a more in depth evaluation.
0.800000	It's simply in their best interest to do their job to the best of their abilities. There's little to gain and a lot to risk if they do otherwise. Of course they're humans so they're not perfect and things happen sometimes.
0.640000	I trust my doctor but not always 100%. Just because he is my doctor doest always mean he or she knows what's best.
1.000000	I really trust her because she listens to me and takes my views and opinions into account. She also is very smart and thinks out loud with me about options to address my concerns rather than just deciding on an option for me.
0.760000	I do research on doctors before I choose them. If I do not like them, I will not stay with the long before finding a new one.
0.280000	"I do not trust my doctors because I have asked them simple questions sometimes and they give me the most basic answer so they don't have to waste their time answering me properly. Example, I asked what type of blood I am and the response I got was: ""Oh, now the type of blood is no longer as easy as a letter. It's complicated. It's a number of letters and numbers. Don't worry about that."" Also, my doctor put me on the wrong treatment once and it lasted for months. "
0.640000	It isn't that I distrust him, but I rarely go to the doctor so I don't have many interactions to reference. 
0.680000	I have experienced hospital and doctor errors so I am now far more careful.  Those errors were significant -- such as not doing a screen of the chest of my husband when he had head/neck cancer, a failure that impacted the treatment given him.
0.240000	I don't believe my doctor has read my medical history and pays any attention to me when I try to address it. The doctor is constrained by some CDC guidelines  which have left my issues untreated for years now and now I suffer more issues so I no longer trust my health care office and they also gave me a vaccine that I had refused for years and I decided to not worry about it until the bill came for $375 that insurance will not pay and that I do not have. I no longer trust them and don't feel I have anywhere to turn for medical care at this time.
0.640000	If I have taken the steps to be in the presence of a healthcare professional, I have exhausted my own body of knowledge and MUST trust them to investigate further and explain the options for treatment as they may be. Their schooling and Hippocratic oath make them the only option at that point, hence one has no option but to trust someone, why not a trained and certified medical professional. 
0.840000	My PCP is very mellow and always has a calm demeanor when engaging with me. He asks questions, is not judgmental when hearing my responses, and often makes suggestions about types of treatment even when I am always willing to go with whatever he recommends first. He has never rushed me during our meetings and I never felt that he saw me as just another patient or that he only saw his profession as just work; he seems to genuinely care about all his clients.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because I have seen her for a long time now and she has never let me down. She's always helpful, always within reach, and she has never given me bad advice. I trust her because I consider her a friend and she feels the same way.
0.800000	I think for the most part doctors are persoble and want to help their patients. Doctors are generally fairly nice to their patients and want to find the best care practice for them.
0.400000	At this current time in my life I do not have a primary care doctor so I would be discussing doctors in general as a whole. I feel the training they received from medical schools is geared towards treating symptoms and prescribing medications and not curing the issue. This would be due to Pharmaceutical industry having such a firm holm on lobbying the medical education system. Doctors need funding and will do what is needed or asked in order to get said funding. It is a business and that means the end user/patient is not always going to be the focus of concern.
0.440000	I normally distrust them. They love to hurry my along and don't seem like they're really listening to me. They just rather get me in-and-out quick to make fast money. I always leave there disappointed in them.
0.800000	I completely trust my primary care physician. Any questions that I have had in the past have been answered. I am able to schedule appointments or talk with them when needed. Any concerns I have had about my health have been addressed quickly. 
0.600000	The main reason why I trust most my primary care physician is that most of them want to take care of people and also have a secure job to hang on too.
0.960000	I have been with my doctor long enough for him to know my history. I think he always chooses the best path for me and we work together on long term plans for health. 
0.960000	He knows more about medical conditions than I do. He has years of education in the medical field and I would only know what I can find in books, searching on medical websites for information and from asking other people about medical conditions.
0.760000	I generally trust my physician because of past experience. I also tend to recognize the reason for their assessments.
0.720000	I trust my primary physician because I have always taken care of myself to the best of my abilities and if I'm not he would tell me. If there's a issue with my physical health And if there something wrong he would tell me straight up. 
0.200000	SHE IS FORGETFULLSHE FORGOT TO ORDER ALL MY MEDS THAT SHE WANTED ME TO HAVE...SHE DOES NOT EXPLAIN ALL TEST I HAVE TAKEN,,
0.840000	I just have always liked them and felt right with them. They are always good to me
1.000000	I trust my physician because shes always been honest as your doctor should be. She would explain anything that i don't understand or let me know what shes concerned about regarding my health.
0.720000	Because we think they are knowledgeable and we believe in them and put our trust in them and expect them to provide us with proper guidece
0.800000	I generally trust doctors and I never asked for a second medical opinion (unless I noticed that they had a bad attitude towards me and towards other people in general).
1.000000	i have had the same doctor for 22 years he tells me every thing about my health he holds nothing back he is trueful to me about my health and tells me what i need to do for my own good where i like it or not
0.720000	My primary case physician spends a lot of time with me and any issues I have are probably due to my inability to communicate my issues to him effectively.
0.800000	My doctor always provides an explanation of why I may or may not need a treat.  He provides all of the pros and cons that help me with a decision.
0.800000	The doctor/patient relationship (e.g., trust-building) is very important to the health community as a whole.
0.480000	My doctor spends about 10 minutes total with me.  Seems like she half listens to what I'm explaining and always quick to write several prescriptions to see which one will work.
1.000000	I have been with  my primacy care physician for 14 years.  He has been with me every step of the way during my cancer surgery and treatments and has shown a great depth of interest in my well being.  He was very understanding and compassionate during that time and extremely helpful as always.
0.680000	I trust my primary physician because he has always given me good advice and never steered me wrong 
0.800000	My Doctor is from our community and goes to our local church. She has a daughter also that is one of our best EMTs locally. She also doesn't care about if you can pay her right away. 
0.800000	I fully trust my physician. I feel like she understand and care about me. She listens to me and help me to the best of her ability.
0.480000	I don't like it when I go to the doctor and they can't find out what is wrong with me so they just contribute it to something else without getting down to what is causing my problems. I always thought that the doctors were there to look into things and find a cause and help to make it better, but now it seems they are only here to collect big paychecks whether they help a person or not.
0.440000	Doctors these days are money motivated and are paid by the system. It's rigged to get people on prescriptions that kill you!
0.800000	Because they take a medical oath and have ethics that they have to follow. It's not about what they want to do, its about what's right and what's wrong. They have always looked out for my interest in health care and are not subjective or bias.
1.000000	my doctor keeps up with current research and medical journals. she is good at reading my tests - blood, urine, etc. she is knowledgeable about all my medical conditions and the right medications for me.
0.600000	I mostly trust doctors, but complete trust has to be built up over time.  And doctors are people too and make mistakes.  I believe they try to do their best, but sometimes they are working with limited information - I don't always remember to tell them everything.
0.960000	I love my doctor!  I started seeing him several years ago because of some mild but confusing symptoms a GP thought needed special attention from an endocrinologist.  My mom had been seeing this doctor- Dr. Marcus- for some time before, so I had a good recommendation.  Dr. Marcus is very kind, very thorough, and an impression diagnostician.  He was able to guess at possible causes for what seemed like very strange symptoms and had me take various tests to confirm things and rrow down the possibilities.  He always answers all my questions and believes strongly in preventative medicine.
1.000000	I completely trust my Dr because he has been my family physician every since I can remember. He has always been good with diagnosis, treatments and helping with affordable medicine. 
0.760000	I've been with my primary doctor for years and he's already proven himself to me. He was able to dispose sinus problems I have work recommending Claritin D and Flonase daily. Others kept referring me to ENTs who have me no real answers to my constant sinus infections.
0.880000	I feel like I have to trust him.  I am allowing him to look after my health.  If I didn't trust that his decisions or education was good enough I would happily find a new doctor.
0.680000	If he can help me get better 
0.760000	My PCP is open and I believe honest. She also takes time to listen carefully to me, and I believe she respects my input. I feel we work together as a team, and her words and actions reinforce my belief.
1.000000	Our family physician has been our physician for over 30 years. He has interest in our family relations. He, at times, is more of a friend then he is a doctor.
0.880000	dr paddord has saved my life twice  once when i was septic and once when i was extremely anemic.transferring me to st. patrick hospital in missoula mt both times saved my life
0.400000	Because I hate people and no one truly cares about u unless they love you. People become doctors mostly for the paycheck 
0.560000	My doctor is good at his job but one day he scheduled an appointment and he chose someone else to treat me for an injury I had and the person he chose did the worst job possible.
0.640000	I trust my doctor because she always listens to what i want and needs she helps me get all the tests I need 
0.640000	I like my doctor and he has always been conservative in his treatments.  He lets me know when something will have a side affect and also lets me know when he is doubtful that something will work but is willing to try.  I feel that he is in general very honest with me.
1.000000	My doctor came with high recommendations. After several visits, he is very thorough, asks questions to get a better understanding, and is open.  He makes sure to ask if I understand, if I have any other questions or concerns.  
0.720000	They know what they are doing and how to make things better. It's helpfully to know what's going on in your body
0.480000	My doctor is intelligent and easy to open up to for the most part.  But sometimes I feel rushed.  Sometimes I feel she is a bit condescending or quick to jump to conclusions.  I generally feel she is not as thorough as I would like.  I supplement the visit with a lot of internet research.  I mainly go to her for basic checkups.  It's very hard to find a doctor who you really like, who listens to you, who doesn't rush you, who you trust, who you feel comfortable talking openly with, who is non judgemental, who takes your insurance and continues to take your insurance, who gives you good answers to your medical problems, who has a competent and caring staff.  In the end I think most people settle for someone who meets some of those characteristics.  Or maybe they just stay with a doctor they are unhappy with.  Sometimes you can't always find what you want.  But I do think the medical professionals and the insurance industry should do a lot better.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because she tells me everything that i may be concerned about and that it brings the least of my worries 
0.440000	I feel Doctor's no longer spend time engaging with their patients. It's in and out. I feel most of what's said is ignored and simply one problem is quickly looked at and guessed with what the popular treatment is at the moment.
0.640000	He is very young but seems to be engaged with his patients 
0.760000	My primary care physician is really good. She is hired by my company and not her own doctor's office, so she really cares about taking the time to listen and explain things to me. 
0.480000	I do think that having different insurances make a huge difference in how you are treated and what treatments are available
0.840000	I trust the doctors will do the right thing and to be honest with as much as possible. To also be clear on what the doctor is explaining to me.
0.800000	She spends an ample amount of time with me during my visits and makes sure to answer all of my questions. She also goes over every part of my visit and blood work in detail. She also follows up with any questions over the phone. 
0.960000	My primary care physician was my pediatrician. I reconnected with him after 20 years. He is a good listener, and not fond of medications. Likes me to work out problems every other way before trying meds.
0.600000	I love my doctors he really care about me and he sees my son and he cares bout him too my doctor is a good doctor
0.760000	I trust my doctor because they do not make me feel dumb about the questions I ask and are always willing to answer more questions I have.
0.760000	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable about the field of medicine than I am, so I listen to them.
0.880000	He is great. I enjoy going to my doctor.  He has been my doctor for some time and he always recommends what is best for the situation.  He doesn't rush me to do anything and he is always keeping up with how I am doing.
1.000000	She makes me feel completely comfortable and she listens. She explains everything to me and answers any and all questions I may have.
0.640000	Some doctors are in it for the money
1.000000	My primary care doctor has been working many, many decades. He's very straight forward. My husbands sister also use to work for him, and she's called him an asshole but completely trusts him and his judgement. I feel the same way.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I feel she's always done great with me as a patient. She's thorough, explains anything I don't understand very well, and is just extremely reliable all and all. I trust her because I've had great past experiences with her.
0.600000	I trusted my previous doctor who referred me to my current doctor.  she seems to be knowledgeable.    
0.760000	I trust my doctor because he genuinely seems to care, my health is well, and he is very knowledgeable. I have been visiting his clinic for over 10 years now and am very comfortable with them.
0.600000	I trust my Dr. But sometimes they need to take people serious and learn about a disease instead of blowing it off.
0.600000	He seems like  a  good  person  hope  I can  keep  this one longer then a year  I hope  all goes  well  with  this  doctor  
0.800000	My doctor usually tells me everything that they want me to do and why I need to do this and why it will help me.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician, but sometimes I don't feel like we could do be everything that we should be doing to make me feel better.
0.800000	They have shown me options that don't cost me money at all. Something that I can do on my own to help deal with issues I may have. His last resort would be additiol treatment or medication. 
0.920000	My doctor understans and is careing about you i trust him to the fullestmy doctor care he stays the same make me want to go back
0.800000	I feel like most doctors have the patients best interests in mind.  I know some doctors are only here for the pay and try to make money any way possible but, I tend to have a lot of faith in people and trust doctors unless they give me a reason not to.
1.000000	I like and trust my PC physcian because we actually discuss my issues, treatments and options, I can bring up ideas she has not brought up and we can discuss them, she is open,  I can make my decision based on my needs and she is supportive.
0.560000	Haven't been to the doctor in a while. I'm not sure if I have ever met my new doctor. I don't get sick often
0.840000	I have had the same doctors for 19 years. I have built a relationship with them and trust their decisions. There has been trial and error over the years which has made me more trusting of them and their recommendations 
0.760000	My doctor seems genuine and intelligent. She generally provides me with a range of options before prescribing a particular one. She seems heartfelt and concerned, and takes time to talk with me.
0.880000	I trust my primary care physician because he has been treating me ever since I was little. My mother was taking me to a different doctor when I was younger and he was repeatedly misdiagnosing my illness. My mother got frustrated and switched doctors, the one of which is still my current primary care physician.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she listens carefully to me, asks appropriate questions and does not dismiss my concerns.  She takes the time to get all pertinent information and thinks about my particular case before diagnosing or prescribing anything.
0.760000	I have somewhat trust in my primary care physician.  However, I've only seen him once in two years.  The process now is to see a physician assistant rather than the doctor.
0.720000	Depends on the expertise of the doctor. If he/she is a specialist then I have a little more faith in the diagnosis. 
0.680000	I've been put on meds that ended me up having renal failure and hospitalized. I had another doctor prescribe something that didn't work well with another medication. I'm overly cautious.
1.000000	I have been with him for a long time. He listens to what  I have to say and works hard to make sure that he gives me good care and treatment and gets me feeling better. If there is something he feels he can not help me with he will find someone who can treat me better
0.440000	I really have no reason to distrust my PCP.  So far, she has not proposed anything which I felt to be wrong.  Further, I'll ask questions should I feel uncertain.
0.600000	I feel neutral towards my doctor, only because I'm the type of person who only goes to the doctor when I'm very sick and need medication. I think doctors are human and they all make mistakes sometimes, but in general I trust doctors. 
0.800000	I trust doctors because they're well-trained and well-intentioned. However, like in many professions, skill level varies with experience and with the doctor in general. Also, there are always more and more cutting edge treatments and statistical evidence being released that often changes things significantly. On top of this, the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and doctors does cause some concern. So a patient should always do due diligence when it comes to any serious procedure, condition, or medication. That being said, the doctor is almost always going to improve your situation and make you aware of what your health circumstances are.
0.560000	Strongly think this is a good app and I think I am loving it and getting real good at it and I thank you for this opportunity
0.440000	I think it is probably inefficient for a doctor to be thorough, especially if the best course of action for me might be unconventional. 
0.760000	If my physician is a hands on experienced type of person, then i trust him/her. One who genuinely cares for his/her patients. One who does everything he/she is supposed to do. One who cares about getting the job done and right. He/she acknowledges they are not perfect whatsoever. That is my kind of physician.
0.600000	I trust God that is because they're always right you need to tell me was glad to do it myself that I just asked
0.200000	I am in the process of changing Dr's. I recently have been mis-diagnosed and received wrong meds. Also not given blood tests that where needed in advance of cataract surgeru
0.800000	My doctor always takes time with me and ask my feelings towards things. They have never misguided me and always seem to have my best interest in mind.
0.800000	I feel like they have my best interest at heart. I can trust that they know what they are talking about and are educated in their field so I don't have to worry about my health.
0.680000	I trust them to use the knowledge they have or to refer me to another who is more specilized. I would distrust if they felt they could handle all troubles.
0.520000	I feel they just want to hurry me out of the office. And although I ask the questions they cliup through them without full explanation or simple yes and no as opposed to futher explanation.
0.680000	I do understand that some doctors try to generalize symptoms for pharmaceutical practices here in America. This sometimes causes doctors to prescribe certain drugs or procedures that may be common to their field. However, I think healthcare has allowed more transfers from physicians to the specialist. Helping things become more focused and thorough.
0.920000	My primary care doctor has been in the medical profession for many years and is very well-respected in our local community.  He is direct and honest, and open to ideas about my and my family's treatment options. 
0.800000	She has been truthful the whole time I have been seeing her. I don't see her being untruthful now. She is a great person who is concerned about my well being.
0.800000	I trust doctors until I find out they are wrong. So far all my doctors have treated me well and never been wrong.
0.600000	Most of my more recent physicians have told me about treatments that they preferred, and completely neglected to tell me about other types of treatments that would be better, cheaper, and used newer techniques. They were an older doctor, and worked for a free clinic so I suspect they weren't keeping up with newer techniques (in their defense, they do come out at a blistering pace) and instead defaulted to an older, less effective series of treatments. This has happened a fair amount to me, and has led me to doing my own research and getting a second opinion.
0.680000	my doctor is human and even though researches the products still want to make a quick buck and ginipig pig us patients
0.720000	I feel like I can trust my primary care physician because I do not sense that he would provide bad advice.  I do sometimes have concerns because while his intentions are good he might not be aware of every condition or treatment option.  Sometimes I feel like seeing a specialist is the best alternative.
0.640000	For the most part I feel the information provided is accurate, I don't believe the doctor would give wrong information intentionally and if I feel unsure a second opinion is ok to get.
0.600000	I think doctors are alright, but I feel hesitant with medical professionals because there are so many institutional biases such as racism, heterosexism, classism, and transphobia. I don't feel comfortable opening up to physicians about my sexuality because there is usually some judgement on their end about it. 
0.680000	I trust doctors because they have medical experience and know more than I do That is why I go to them when I am sick or have a medical problem
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician or regard to doctors in general because they are doctors and suppose to be trusted they hold information that is very private and personal to us and have to be trusted because of such. She's also kind. 
0.640000	I trust that they have more knowledge about medical issues than I have. That being said, I don't very often put 100% faith in anybody's opinion. I'll do my own research even if it's minimal, and if I'm really uncertain a second opinion is always nice.
0.600000	I feel that the doctor has too many uncertain opinions at times. They run a practice and go by what you tell them and form opinions. However, some things they do know and i give them credit for.
0.480000	In general, doctors have been proven to be driven by incentives provided by the pharmaceutical industry and base their medical judgments on poorly proven science 
0.440000	Because i believe and put my trust in god the physicians and doctors can only do so much be its gods power that can perform miracles
0.800000	My doctor always gives me several options for and would be treatment I may need be it medicine, further testing and even sending me for second opinions.
0.760000	My doctor gave me information pamphlet about my knee, having slight pain in left knee she suggested going to physical therapy which helped me tremendously 
0.920000	Their job Is to keep you alive if they fail that then that's a loss of life on their hands. Their completly trained for eight years to be doing what their doing
0.640000	Sometimes when I'm sick, I go in and they give me one medication. My condition sometimes stays the same and sometimes gets worse, so I go back in and they give me a different medication. I understand that medicine practice can be experimental, but I hope that isn't regularly the case AND it should definitely not be the case when messing with things like antibiotics. 
0.800000	I've had the same physician for years now. So,  he has gained my trust.
0.800000	I feel that my primary care physican has my best interests at heart. He spends a lot of time with me and answers all my questions to my satisfaction.
0.480000	Sometimes doctors are all about what they think is best and not caring much about what the patient things. I say this from experience as with taking a medication I knew that was making me rather sick and the doctor not listening and not taking me off of the medication because he didn't feel the need to look into other options.
0.680000	Because the doctor I have has been through the necessary schooling and experience so I trust his or her judgement
0.400000	My PCP only takes 5 minutes with me, asks me a couple of questions, fills out a prescription slip and quickly leaves the room. I do not feel she is acting in my best interests, and she does not listen to me. I react very badly to most manufactured pharmaceuticals, my doctor knows this and keeps trying to insist I try newer meds. Every single time I switch doctors they want to try this. I flatly refuse as I know how ill they will make me. My attitude is... if it's not broken, don't fix it!  I have met very few doctors that actually take the time to listen and really HEAR what I am saying. All I want is a diagnosis and I will treat myself with natural remedies, if possible.  
0.640000	I think my doctors take the time to answer questions but also try to make sure I have the most options covered.
0.520000	In general, I see doctors as people doing a job. A PCP does not usually have deep knowledge about whatever specific problem you're having, but they are able to refer you to a specialist who can possibly help you if you need it. PCPs are basically drug dealers for the pharmaceutical companies.
0.600000	I don't trust doctors at all, their prone to lie. Jyst to get more monwy. Its disgusting. Ive been lied to before about my health. So I wont let it happen to me again. 
0.600000	I'm sorry I haven't heard from a different way of getting a new phone. I am going to be able to get to know about it and I will be able to do the same. 
0.560000	I am close with my doctor.  They are always in a great mood and able to talk to me in a calm manner and I can trust what they are saying and doing is in my best interest.  I think that all doctors are in the job for the right reasons.
0.800000	I trust doctors in general because I grew up around them, and saw that almost all of them were there to help people. I don't believe any of them would suggest a treatment for any other reason than it being the best thing for the patient at that time.
0.760000	I like her a lot and she hasn't steered me wrong so far.  I feel like she's honest with me about her opinions and my options.
0.680000	I think that most doctors are very trustworthy and careful about there jobs and recommendations.  There are always people that might not care about their jobs as much in any area of business.
0.960000	I've been going to the same doctor about 15 years now - if I don't trust her I wouldn't Be going to her.  She's  very understandable when it comes to my needs and knows what best for me.
1.000000	I have had the same dr for years and she has never steered me wrong. Always disagnosed properly for whatever i came to them for, or gave the correct medicine that healed me for any sickness. My privacy has never been invaded. I trust my doctor
0.480000	I don't feel like they take the time to get to know me. And what I would want or offer me all options or ask questions. 
0.800000	Me and my doctor have a 20yrs relationship he new me when I was well and new me when I was sick. So keeping me healthy has been a mission between us. Information he's giving have been good advice so when he  say I need a certain  test I accept with  confidence  we work together to keep my healthcare affordable and efficient. I get my flu shot every year and have saved money for over the counter cold medicine. I my pneumonia shots to stay out of the emergency room. Now my medical records are digital so I don't have repeated test all to keep cost down doing my part to achieve affordable health care. 
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because his demeanor is very calm, friendly and because he is a good listener. He tends to be very patient, answers all of my questions and speaks with authority. When he has not been confident, he has sent me to a specialist rather than commit to a potentially inaccurate diagnosis.
0.920000	He spends the time needed to answer all my questions. He is respectful and kind. The office staff reminds me of my appointments.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because he's been my doctor for many many years and knows me.  My only concern is that he sometimes deems my problems less serious than I do.
0.720000	I trust him as a person but I'm not sure if I can fully trust any doctor. I've seen a lot of documentaries and read a lot about the health care system in regards to Black people. I don't believe they always have my well being in mind. 
0.600000	I'm not crazy about him, but I'm on Medicaid and few good doctors. take it.
1.000000	My Primary care Physician is a HEALER, NOT A BUSINESSMAN, LIKE THESE YOUNG QUACKS THAT ARE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. Outside of my father, he is the finest man I have ever encountered. 
0.800000	Some doctors are not transparent and they just tell you things without giving you the opportunity to ask them questions and address your concerns. The doctor encourages me to ask questions and tries to clarify my concerns.
0.520000	I have no primary care physician now. Dealing with doctors in the past is the main reason I don't bother with them. I found them to rarely be good listeners. They are too concerned with covering their own ass these days than actually taking care of people.
0.800000	I feel like he has been honest and forthcoming with me.  I went in with questions and I expected him to have answers, because when I chose him, we had a similar outlook about the prescription drug epidemic in America.  That being said, I asked about different vitamins and supplements, since I'd heard a lot of them are unnecessary.  Not only did he tell me which ones I need, but the amounts, which was hugely helpful
0.720000	I trust my primary care physician, because she remember all my health history, and she is very good. 
0.760000	My doctor explains all my options for my treatment and gives me a sense of security when I have questions and concerns about my health. 
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he us experienced.  He also takes the time to figure out what is wrong.   He is also available when I need him.
0.600000	My visits often feels hurried and like there's not enough time for a thorough consideration of my health issues. She seems completely competent, but I don't think enough time is given for her to really be very thorough.
0.760000	My doctor always seems to know what the correct diagnosis is for any given thing for which I consult him. Sometimes he's a little rushed but he does try to make conversation and show interest in my life outside of whatever medical issue is at hand.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because they are the professional and have extensive experience in their field.  They place people's care in their hands daily and committ to doing their very best.
0.640000	Sometimes doctors are under time constraints and don't have the time to thoroughly explain things to their patients
0.560000	I trust my doctor in that I trust him or her to not harm me in any way. But in a world of referrals, its often easier to ship me off to a specialist and still charge me, then to actually do things that will help me. Sometimes a specialist can be the right call, and sometimes its just convenient for the doctor.     
0.760000	No primary care physician, but I feel that their Hippocratic oath binds them to being the best they can for their patients
0.880000	I trust my primary care doctor because he also has experience in alternative medicine. He takes in consideration that you are a whole person(body,mind,and spirit). He is honest about what your options are when he tells you the symptoms. .  
0.720000	My doctor augmented my lexapro prescription with wellbutrin, and her knowledge to do that was very thorough in my opinion.
0.600000	I guess that I trust my doctor. It really does no good not to. I don't know anything about it. I guess the only thing you can do is get a second opinion because someone else might have a different perspective.
0.680000	I trust that they care about the patients. They seem to want what is best for us and provide all the options. There are more effective doctors out there though I'm sure. They can still be wrong, or overlook something, especially if they are overworked.
0.680000	I primarily trust my primary care physician because I have made a relationship with my doctor. In most cases if I feel uncomfortable or disagree with his treatment I can speak my mind with out ridicule. If my doctor is unsure he will ask a more experienced doctor for their medical opinion which shows he cares and is not scared to show he may not know the most about everything wrong with me. 
1.000000	He has been there every step of the way. He make me feel comfortable about dealing with my illness. 
0.760000	I generally trust my doctor.  If I had doubts, I would seek a second opinion. My doctor has many years experience and I am generally in excellent health.
0.920000	My doctor goes over my records prior to my appointment. She asks questions pertaining to the medicines I take and my well being. When she see something different about me she checks on/sends me to a specialist to ensure all is well. She lets me asks questions and she answers them honestly. She gives her medical advice specific to my needs.
0.640000	I have had the same doctor for almost 30 years.  He has always been there when I have needed him for myself or my kids.
0.520000	You can't be sure who to trust in the medical field, one person is different than the other, but most are all out for the money, not for much else.
0.960000	My doctor tell me like it is ,he always tell me if im doing good are bad. and will call and see how im doing on the meds and to make sure im taking them the way he wants me to,
0.360000	I feel like my doctor is in a hurry. She is wanting to get through with the exam and move on to the next patient. If I ask a question, she rushes through the answer. I can always tell she is focused on getting to the next person. So I don't necessarily trust her to be thorough or careful.
0.600000	"I disagree with a lot of what is taught in ""conventional"" medicine and I do not believe doctors are taught everything they should be taught and are left ""ignorant"" in regard to a lot of important information. Most doctors are trained to be ""pill dispensers"" and are not trained to discover the root cause of most illness. I don't blame doctors as much as I blame the ""establishment"" for the way they teach medicine and put so much emphasis on getting as many patients in and out as possible and maximizing profit."
0.560000	I don't think most physicians are as up to date as they should be or as willing to look into the issues that they should always
0.760000	I've been seeing him for +10 years. He's extremely thorough. I could complain about a slight ache and he'd order a whole x-ray just to be sure nothing else is going on. He's very competent and has listened to me in the past and talked to me
0.600000	I truth my doctors they wont do anything that would hurt me they are there to help me not to do me any harm
0.640000	Sometimes I feel like he is not hearing anything I say. He is listening but he is not taking in to account what I am saying.
0.240000	My experiences with doctors in general has been extremely negative.I once broke my ankle and the medical staff wanted to amputate.I refused treatment got a second opinion,had surgery and now walk fine.I had an infection from stepping on a il.The doctor said I would die if I didnt go through a horrific procedure.I refused treatment again and am still alive and healthy.I find most doctors lack the proper skills to diagnose and treat medical problems and have lost faith in the system.If I had trusted the doctors I dealt with in the past I would be in terrible shape.Im glad I was brave enough to stand up to these individuals who are trusted with peoples lives and health and find the proposition of consulting with a doctor as scary and unreliable.
0.840000	I trust my physician because he or she knows the best in health and will tell their opinion based on knowledge.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because thus far i have not been given a reason not to trust her and her expertise. 
0.480000	"I really hate how ""trust"" is even a factor. It bothers me that when I'm given information, it sounds a lot like a factual answer when in fact it is an opinion. I've met young doctors who are bright, older doctors who are dim, and vice versa, so it's difficult to gauge the competency of who I'm speaking to. And really, the only way to tell if someone is right or wrong is if I know the answer already, which I almost never do. "
0.960000	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  He's one of the few good ones left that takes the time to get to know you and talk to you.  I feel like he's a close friend when I'm there.
0.800000	I have had my PC for 15 years now. We have a relationship that is based on trust and friendship and he is always there to discuss any problems I have. He is an excellent doctor and has a great manner with patients.
1.000000	My physicians seems to want me to stay healthy. They give good and reasoble advice.
0.600000	I don't feel that my doctor actually takes the time to always understand what I am experiencing.  I feel that he thinks that since I meet the general criteria then I am in a category that I am not necessarily in.  My first experience with him I was a little overweight and had high blood pressure.  He said that if I don't loose weight by my next visit we need to discuss weight loss surgery.  Crazy.
0.600000	My trust is mixed. I've had great experiences with my doctor where they were very caring and compassionate and helpful. There have been other times when it didn't seem likes they cared about me at all. One time they abandoned me in a room so they wouldn't miss their tee time.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he always gives me options on treatments. he tells me the pros and cons of each type of treatment offered. He lets me choose what I feel is right for me.
0.760000	My regular doctor knows what i need and has never been wrong. The hospital doctors on the other hand just send me away with what ever they feel like saying that day and send you home with out treating you.
0.760000	I feel that she wants what is best and is honest and has my well being first when it comes to me and my health
0.760000	I have been under this doctor's care for over 10 years.  He inherited me as a patient from my previous physician, who retired. I was one of his first patients and we have become friends.  I have learned to trust him, and have never found his diagnostic instincts to be in error.  He knows when to treat me for a problem, and when to leave me alone.  He is a kind human being and a good physician.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because they have saved over millions of lives throughout their years of assisting patients.
0.840000	I have always had no issues or concerns with my doctor and believe that they have my best interest in mind and are honest with me.
0.600000	I do and dont trust them but i know they mean best interest at heart for trearment and health conditions
0.680000	With my PCP, there has been a long relationship, he know my needs/wants and is able to accommodate them in most instances. If I did not trust my PCP, I would get a different one. 
0.920000	My doctor is through and never makes us feel rushed. We feel like we are the only one there. They watch our medications to warn us of a conflict. They tell us all of the side effects.
0.800000	She takes the time to really understand what is happening and asks thoughtful questions to provide better health treatment without making you feel guilty about how you responded to her. She makes thoughtful suggestions without coming off as pushy or judgemental.
0.760000	I trust my primary care doctor because she does a thorough check with me when I see her for daily check ups. She is always very patient and kind despite how mean some patients can be. She also suggests where I can run tests that won't cost me money. There's never been an incident where I lost my trust in her.
0.560000	I feel that my doctor is generally knowledgeable and competent; I just think that sometimes my sessions are rushed through, as if I'm just another customer to pay for their services. I don't distrust my doctor, but I do often believe that my doctor should spend more time with me.
0.840000	i trust my doctor because she takes her time with me to find out what is best for me. she also gives me advice on what kind of medications that would be good for my condition
0.560000	I sometimes get the impression from my doctor that they do want to do anything too risky, and often times medical conditions go untreated. For example, when getting colds, the doctor might just suggest that I wash my hands more frequently. That may be effective, but I could find that out by searching the internet, or even by thinking. I dislike paying medical bills for these types of consultations.
0.440000	I trust doctors being they e had more schooling in medical than the average person but sometimes it's hard to trust them because they check you over and diagnose problems so quickly or sometimes they have to look up your symptoms or ask a colleague for advice to determine a diagnosis. 
0.760000	I feel she is very thorough.  She has done more tests on me then previous doctors, and usually has answers for me on any questions I have.
0.440000	The doctor will give you a treatment option that they are familiar with and usually that is not all the options that are available. Insurance companies also influence doctors and the type of treatments they cover. Research the subject on your own, in my opinion.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because I feel like he has my best interest and wants the best for me long term in my health.
0.880000	Good references from other people concerning his technical ability, thoroughness, genuine interest in patients.  He's also embedded in a system with lots of other support services, and uses them thoughtfully.
0.680000	i really have no choice but to put my trust into my doctor sometimes, because health is theyre field. 
0.840000	I think that my primary care physician sometimes doesn't take my interests into account. That makes me feel like my doctor isn't completely trustworthy. I have told them about how I've tried solutions that they suggest, but I am not receiving alternative solutions after saying so.
0.840000	I have a lot of trust in my doctor because he is a close family friend, but I sometimes notice that some of the things he says are a little bit for his convenience.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because I believe in their expertise, years of training, and experience in the field. I do not consider myself a medical expert so believe it is in my best interest to defer recommendations to a professional who can offer informed guidance. 
0.840000	My doctor is pretty thorough in treatment options. She sat with me for 30 minutes discussing different types of medications I could take for a related health problem.
1.000000	Ive been seeing this doctor for a long time and she actually happens to be a relative through marriage many many years ago so i have no reason to believe she would be completely honest so i am the same with her
1.000000	My primary doctor is great and the office workers are fantastic. Any time I have a problem I can always call and they help me 
0.720000	I feel like my doctor is very capable and knows what he is doing.  However, I think he tries to schedule too many patients in one day, leaving very little time to tend to each patient.  Each time I go in, I feel like he hasn't even read my chart and I have to explain my situation to him each time like I am a new patient.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician completely. He is wise, sensible, practical. He always has time for questions or discussion on issues important to me. He has never steered me wrong.
0.840000	Well if anyone knows me better than myself it would be my doctor hopefully so I yeah I have trust in my doctor
0.600000	I used to not trust my other Doctor, but them I got rid of him and now I have a new doctor. I trust my new doctor a lot more than my old one. I don't put my trust in anyone too much, but I trust this new doctor a little bit more.
0.920000	It's not a business that has a lot of corruption or under-the-table payments, so doctors have little reason to lie or sway you in a direction that's not beneficial to you.
0.520000	my doctor does not tell me choices I need to figure out the options that I can choose from.  I have side effects
0.680000	Doctors are human.  Yes, they are highly trained and can have lots of experience, but mistakes still happen.  Sometimes it's a simple fault, and sometimes it's due to complacency.  In any case, I bear the responsibility for my health, not them.  They can make suggestions and offer advice, but it is ultimately up to me what happens to maintain my health.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I know a lot of other people who see her too.  Others in the medical field have told me how good she is too. 
0.520000	I suffered from migraines for years, my doctors always said to just stay away from my triggers. They never worked with me to reduce or relieve them. 
1.000000	"In regard to my doctor in he eral regardi g my primary care physician , I completely trust their decisions when it comes to my health and diagnoses of ""it"""
0.800000	I think that most doctors try their best to give me the best treatment and offer good advice on what i need to do or what needs to be done.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because she is extremely honest with me and has offered me different methods of medications that my previous doctor did not. 
0.800000	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Over the years she has been correct many times, when it comes to my health. She has given me the best healthcare service. She has tried to improve my health time after time.
0.800000	i trust him because he is a very smart individual.  Nearly everything he  does for me or recommends seem to work out for the better.; weather its advice or prescribing medication for me.
0.720000	I have no reason not to trust these people. I would also expect someone to trust me in my profession just the same.
0.520000	I feel I can trust my primary care doctor within reason.  I do feel some of the newer drugs he tries to put me on are because he gets some sort of kick back.  I question if these drugs are really in my best interest or in his.  I also feel that sometimes he doesn't listen to what I am saying and just goes by the book.  
0.800000	I trust my physician because I have checked his credentials before I have signed up with him. Also I have learned to trust him even more because my brother who is a doctor too in another country agrees to everything that my primary doctor says.
0.920000	i've been with my primary care md for many years and he knows me on a personal level.  he also doesn't over prescribe tests or medicine unless there's a strong clinical need for them.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he is always blunt and honest. If I'm doing something to cause the issue he will tell me, and he gives me realistic ideas of the end results or recovery time. 
0.320000	Doctors are always trying to get you to take medications that don't really cure the condition. Their priorities are to the pharmaceutical company and not to the patient. They are not in the business of trying to get people well, just getting patients to take medicines to mage the illness.
1.000000	i do trust my doctor to tell me about my health an what better I can do to help myself an the things I should do
0.360000	I think that they want to do what is best but I also feel with the insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies around that it is hard for them to always do what might be best for the patient. They try to use universal fixes for everyone and instead of fixing the underlying issue they just prescribe medicine which causes more issues.  
0.520000	its happen couple times when i went to my primary care physician she was wrong about my illness then i had to ask her about it and then she used to prescribe other medicine. i dont trust now days to doctors. most of them look in google for clues.   
0.560000	I don't regularly go to a primary care provider because I usually don't have reason to.  But I have seen so many instances where doctors completely overlook and miss things that are life threatening. It's scary so I don't have complete trust. 
0.440000	When I offer another doctors opinion he immediately tells me they are wrong without explanation. He prescribes medications like they are candy. He gets very angry and impatient with questions or not understanding. He refuses to hear the issues I am there to see him for in full. I am cut off and he starts a physical exam instead of hearing me out. 
0.480000	I do not see a doctor often. I only visit a doctor when I am sick. I can't afford to see a doctor on a regular basis
1.000000	i trust my doctor to give me good advice on all of medical needs and provide good advice on my meds and good advice on my other medical needs
0.520000	My Dr. really cares for her patients. She is wonderful. If you have an issue, she will give you a list of specialists and tell you, which one you should go. he is very professional.
0.680000	my doctor is very friendly with me and i relate to him as a person of similar age, race, and gender. we seem to get along almost as friends
0.440000	Doctors I like in general, because I feel they honestly want to help others but they have to rely on what they are taught. What they're taught generally doesn't align with my health goals however. I generally expect doctors to prescribe medication of some sort for whatever the ailment might be. I can't trust any decisions that involve me taking medication. If doctors prescribed particular foods and natural things that could remedy the ailment, I may feel differently about trusting their decisions.
0.760000	I feel that physicians are highly qualified, of course more so that me, with the knowledge on medical issues. A PCP knows you and there is trust in that
0.960000	I have been seeing my doctor for over 7 years now and had seen her very frequently in the last year. All the treatments she prescribed worked for me and she listened what I had concerns.
1.000000	I had a really bad bout of panic/anxiety attacks over a year ago and that's when I reached out to my nurse practitioner. He has helped me through this whole process and still to this day. He is always there when I need to contact him and I have had to try a few different medications until I found the one I am on now (Paxil). He has helped me to understand everything I am feeling and has helped me make a complete 180 in my life. I am forever thankful for my nurse practitioner. He pulled me out of a very hard time, and it was something at the time, that I knew nothing about. So that was also scary to deal with at the time. 
0.600000	I know that healthcare is a business and doctors are humans with the same outside stress as everyone else. I know they are sometimes in a rush and don't always make the right decisions.
0.800000	I get a strong sense from my physician that he truly listens to me, wants to engage my thoughts, and has my best interests in mind. Moreover, my questions are welcome and his explanations are clear. This is why I trust my physician. 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because he will tell me that I'm doing something wrong. For example, my blood sugars were elevated and he told me directly that if I don't cut down my candy consumption, he will not see me as a patient anymore. He really cares for my health and not only that but explains things in real context.
0.720000	I trust my family doctor because I have had health issues come up or things that have bothered me for awhile and other family doctor's couldn't seem to help fix or get the right medication for the problem but this doctor has helped me every time, so I feel she knows what she is doing and I trust her.
0.440000	my doctor only cares about stupid things and not actual issues. I do not get the help that I need. they only throw drugs at the problems and send me on my way
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he always asks me if i understand or if i have any questions he is always following up with me and he is really nice
0.720000	It is hard to trust him when he is rushed and not really answering my questions. I feel that he sees a lot of malingering and assumes that my issues are not as harmful as other people's. I tend to downplay my concerns. I don't want to be a bother to him.
0.960000	My NP seems to have a good grasp on medications I am to be prescribed, giving me confidence in taking it. If it works out not so well, she is on board with another medication that might help instead.
0.760000	HE IS VERY IN THE KNOW AND TAKES TIME TO LISTEN AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT I MIGHT HAVE. HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT ID CAUSING THE HEALTH PROBLEM.
0.600000	Sometimes I feel like the doctor does not listen and treats every case or condition the same. If they have seen something like it before, or have experienced something similar before, they tend to forget that every person is an individual and may react differently to the same condition as someone else
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I feel comfortable. I can ask questions and have an open dialogue with him about any medical issue, concern, etc
0.760000	I have been to him for over a decade as has my spouse. He is a great doctor
0.800000	I do feel at ease with my doctor. I have known her for many years so she knows how my body reacts to things. How I feel about things. I believe in her judgement. 
0.800000	I trust him because he has been one of my doctor's for 15 years and knows my medical history. He bases decisions on my history.
0.600000	I havent been seeing my primary care physician for too long so it is very hard to gauge my level of trust in her. She is competent but, she lacks warmth. Im not sure I will continue seeing her
0.600000	I don't totally trust my primary care physician mostly because I don't know him well enough. He took over when my long time primary care physician retired. What I do know of him is that he is nice enough but always in a hurry and I swear he just looks at his computer and checks off what blood tests I need. If he touches me physically at all it is to listen with his stethoscope and to feel my neck. That's it. Not that I want him to examine every part of me every time, but maybe a bit more thoroughness and a human touch? It's a good thing I'm proactive because if I didn't mention and point out specific problems that should be obvious to a trained physician, I don't think he'd notice.
0.920000	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him. He is very in tune with my medical history. His staff really compliment him as well.
0.720000	I feel doctors are too drug orientated and therefore I tend to distrust their judgement if it does not include alternative or natural treatments. As I have experienced a lot of success in treating my own health issues naturally without drugs I tend to refuse any advice from a doctor that relies heavily on drugs.
0.720000	"My primary care physician treats me with respect and understanding. He has great ""bedside manners"". He always listens to my needs, likes, and dislikes. "
0.800000	She listens to me
0.800000	most doctors for the most part tell you up front what your health is like but it is up to the induvial to listen to the doctor and door what is needed to improve there health
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they have gone to school for a very long time to study medicine. I feel they would not have been given a license if they were not competent enough to provide medical services. I believe most doctors generally want to help people. Even though some doctors are just in their field to make a lot of money. I trust my doctors if they have been practicing for a very long time because this would mean that they have experience. I also go by my gut feelings or intuition about people's character and trustworthiness in general.
0.800000	Trusting one's doctor is based on years of  patronising the Hospital, and sometimes Customer trust the physician just because they are certified doctor.
0.280000	I do not trust any doctor I have seen because all they do is ignore you and always write a prescription just to get you out of there office so they do not have to listen to anything your saying.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she is very reassuring and very willing to talk to me and explain any thing I don't understand 
0.800000	There are a few people in my life that I have to give complete trust to and my doctor is one of those people. He just comes across to me as being knowledgeable and sincere and I have the real impression that he is doing the best he can with the situation that presents itself. 
0.760000	I have seen the same Doctor for years, I have no reason to distrust him as he has never steamed me in the wrong direction regarding my health
0.560000	I trust that my doctor can provide basic care and advice but I do not believe they keep up-to-date on new treatments.  I'm also not confident in their knowledge of things outside their specific scope of practice.  As with all professions, some doctors are very good and knowledge an a majority land somewhere in the middle of competence.
0.720000	I don't currently have a PCP, but in general I trust doctors a little but not totally. I think that to some degree big pharma makes it hard for them to be totally unbiased in their decisions. So I think that have my interest in mind, but I also like to do my own research to back up what I am told.
0.680000	I believe that my primary care physician has my best health thoughts in mind and would not lead me in a direction that would be bad for me
0.800000	I don't have any complex medical conditions so anything the doctor tells me I have no real reason to doubt. I don't see any ill effects from whatever I have been told by my primary doctor.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because I have never been led astray before by him. Every time that I went to my primary care physician, it has been a pleasant experience. I have gotten good medication and health advise. 
0.800000	My doctor seems to be very personable and has my best interest in mind.  She is very down to earth and is someone I can talk to easily.  I think she is doing what is best for my current health, and I know she is educated to make those decisions.  Doctors in general I have dealt with I usually trust.  There have been a few exceptions, but if I don't have a good fit I seek a 2nd opinion.
0.600000	I trust a lot in my doctor because he always speaks clearly and tells me everything, no matter how bad this health
0.600000	I do not really have a doctor.  I have a physician's assistant.  There is a doctor there, and he is listed on my card.  However, I do not see him.  I see the physician's assistant.   She is very considerate and helpful.  If I have a need for anything, I can email her which is very helpful because it is hard for me to hear on the phone.  She usually gets back to me in a good amount of time.  She answers my questions the best she can.  
0.800000	My doctor is known for having excellent bedside manner. She explains medications thoroughly and answers every question fully.
0.760000	I trust my doctor but I always do my own research about my health and medications. I have no problems asking if something is right for me.
1.000000	Because my doctor knows what treatments I need and medicines to prescribe me and their nice and make me feel welcomed they treat me as an whole instead of human
0.960000	My children and I have been seeing our doctor for the last 10 years.  He always remembers everything about my kids as if they are his own.  It's as if he is part of the family.  I can reach out to him at any time of the day and I know that he will be there for us
0.560000	they have a duty to do their job at least competently, but i don't know my PCP very well so I can't really make a persol judgment, my doctor seems pretty busy and rushes me a lot
0.800000	Overall, I trust my physician.  He is professiol, courteous, and always patient in answering my questions.  He is also prompt and ready, when I set an appointment with him.  He is also open-minded and discuss various options and aspects about my health.
0.600000	I need the medical advice that the Dr gives.I have no medical experience. I can always get a second opinion.
0.800000	I have gone to the same physician for all of my adult life now; my mom is his nurse, so I'm always able to get in and out quickly, and believe that he strives to offer me the best care possible.
0.800000	I trust them because they have a lot more knowledge about medical issues than I do. I think most if not all got into the profession to help people, and I dont think they would risk their reputations to harm me. 
0.800000	I have known my primary care physician for a long time and he has always been honest with me. I have never had an incident where my doctor lead me wrong or caused something negative
0.720000	While I do trust my doctor, I still seek out additional information when I feel it necessary.  My doctor has never violated my trust.  I still feel like you can't be too careful, because everyone has bad days and could miss something.
0.520000	Haven't had all that many interactions with primary care doctors but they're usually rushed and seem more about getting through the interaction than anything else. Jaded, too.
0.680000	I trust my doctor him to a certain extent because they have the knowledge and understanding what's going on. It's always best to get a second opinion because you don't know exactly what's right and wrong.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he explains to me exactly what is going on and gives me his best medical advice 
0.800000	My doctor tells me everything what I needed to know, so I  do trust my primary care physician. I trust her in everything
0.560000	No matter where I go it seems doctors and facilities are more concerned about expediency and cost than care.
0.720000	"I trust my primary care physician because she is thorough. There is no ""t"" uncrossed or ""I"" undotted. She asks all of the necessary questions and has a great bed-side manner. So, by being thorough and caring I completely trust her."

0.640000	I trust my doctor because he is willing to answer my questions even as far fetched as they might be, he takes the time to listen to what I have to say
0.800000	I don't have a primary care physician but generally trust doctors. Most doctors, I believe, go into their profession because they are interested in helping people. Still I am sure to research treatments outside of my time at the doctor's office. Even when doctors are perceived as trustworthy, I think it's important to be informed and proactive in your treatment.
0.920000	I have had my Doctor as my Primary Care for over 10 years and he is very open an honest with me and  very straight forward, he doesn't pretend just tells me straight and that what I like.
0.720000	Doctors are highly trained and know what they are doing. They would never intentionally do something to harm me. They want to make me better

0.600000	My doctor recently left her practice so I will be seeing a new doctor. In addition, I always feel that a doctor is trying to get through as many patients as possible. 
0.920000	I'm not a big doctor person. If I can solve it, fix it and feel better on my own then I'm going to. I like my primary care physician though because he understands my nerves and does his best to calm me down. He's been practicing for over 30 years so I feel confident that he has expansive knowledge. His office is modern and high tech, so I feel he keeps up with the times and is up to date with the latest procedures, drugs and treatments. He's always available on call and has no issues coming to the hospital to check on his patients all hours of the night. He's a family man and very trusting. I'm 100% happy and secure with my care in his hands.
0.840000	I trust my PCP a lot. He has been my PCP since I was a teenager. My family have always used him and we kind of feel like his is a friend of the family. He isn't, but it feels that way. He hasn't ever led us wrong and even prevented my father from losing his foot at one point.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician. She takes time to diagnose my health problems and allots enough time to answer my questions.
0.640000	I trust my primary care provider to handle basic health issues that may arise. I also trust that she will put me in touch with a specialist if needdd.
0.920000	several years experience with her - openness to questions, takes time to explain things, honors my decisions
0.760000	I like and generally trust my PCP as a person, because he seems honest and he really does know a lot.  However, looking at him as a physician, I can't honestly say that I trust any doctor completely.  This is mainly because of the constraints put on them by insurance and ideology as well as the influence of Big Pharma, but it also has to do with their patient load and how exhausted they might be.  I know I don't think well when I'm exhausted, and neither will any doctor.  
0.640000	I have been misled at times and questioned my primary care physician's thoroughness and motivation. I still trust them, but would be cautious in not seeking out a second opinion in certain situations.
0.800000	My doctor takes the time to actively listen to me and to address my concerns. I don't feel like a number or like I'm being rushed. He takes the time to explain things to me in a way I understand and is empathetic to what I say.
0.880000	I trust my doctors they usually tell me the truth about my health weather I want to hear it or not i learned alot about my health by asking questions  also i learned alot of medical terms 
0.840000	I trust my doctors because they are honest about what they tell me. They know if something is wrong and I think they give me there honest opion about if there is something wrong with me. If I can't trust my doctors then who can I trust  
0.480000	I think my doctor does not have time for me.  I have to be my own advocate to find out what is wrong.
0.760000	I went through 3 PCP's before deciding to stick with my current choice. This one said the right things on my first visit and instilled confidence in his approach from the get go a marked contrast from the previous two.
1.000000	We have been seeing the same doctor for past 17 years, & have complete confidence in his treatment of all of our problems that may crop up. Our doctor has our complete faith that he will correctly tell us what is wrong, and order the proper test/medicine we will need to correct it. 
1.000000	You ask him a question and he answers with plain English.  If he doesn't know something he will tell you and look it up.

0.880000	I trust my doctor with my health care because they take the time to explain everything and keep me informed at all times of my health care plan. It is easy to get in touch with them and with technology (email, text messages, and skype), it makes life easier to stay in touch.
0.680000	I generally trust them, and believe they would consciously act in my best interest but at the same I acknowledge they may be overworked, see many cases a day, and may overlook details. 
0.720000	I have been to many primary care doctors in the past. Because of this, I have gotten to know who is a good doctor and who is not. My current primary care physician is very helpful and caring. She never rushes me and spends as much time as I need answering my questions. She is also familiar with my condition, so I trust her in giving me the correct dosing for my medication. She is also empathic and can explain things in a way that makes sense. 
0.640000	I generally trust that my doctor is trustworthy however during my pregnancy I did feel that I wasn't always presented with all the information or options due to her preconceived notions about my twin pregnancy and age. 
0.480000	since I'm the only one on this planet that knows me the best, I make sure to research every possible item no matter how trustworthy, skilled or experience the health professional is. people are not perfect and they do make mistakes. 
0.640000	You never really know when to trust doctors... There's the whole profit motive thing these days. A lot of them are basically drug pushers for big pharma.
0.720000	I trust my doctor to the extent that he does not want me to die.  But I am not 100% confident that he has presented me with all the available remedies for my situation as there are new drugs and theories being discovered yearly.
0.560000	My previous primary care physician only purpose was to give out prescriptions. She never once provided any real medical assistance but to give  me prescriptions.  I question most physicians and most advice given by Doctors.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he takes the time to listen to me. I never feel rushed and have to confidence to speak my mind. He also seems to care about how I am doing overall, not just medically. 
1.000000	"Since my first visit, post-diagnosis, my Oncologist has taken the time to thoroughly explain all treatment options, along with the associated benefits and side effects.  He advises which treatment course he recommends and then discusses any questions for concerns I may have.  I am now 8 months past what I like to call my ""expiration date"" of 7 - 14 months life expectancy, on my second treatment option and controlling side effects efficiently with minimal use of additional pharmaceuticals, as my wish s to control my cancer with as few chemicals as absolutely necessary and my Oncologist completely supports that as my choice."
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because we have worked together for a while and she knows what I need and she is always willing to help in any way she can
0.600000	I feel that doctors are very educated and trained individuals who opinions should be taken into consideration. For serious medical conditions, I believe in obtaining second opinions. I am in general weary of taking prescribed medication.
0.520000	I do not like authority
0.800000	There are certain doctors that you have to watch out for because all they want is money. Some ofnthem will send you on a goise chase trying yo figurebouybwhats wrong with you butbthere are good ones out there.

0.720000	He gives it to you straight.  Very thorough. Sometimes he is took much about treating the symptom rather than solving the real problem causing the symptom. He is open to alternative medicines.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician went I have good results from my recent check-ups and I distrust my primary care physician when I have the opposite.
0.800000	My primary care physician has never given me a reason to distrust him. He is always willing to listen to what is bothering me, give his professional opinion of the cause, and let me choose from the treatment options available. Over time, he has earned my complete trust.
0.600000	I don't have a primary care physician at this time.  In general, I do trust my doctors though.  I think most doctors are honest and capable.
0.520000	I do not trust my primary care physician completely because when all is said and done he working for money. People are very money hungry these days. I am not his relative or family so I do not believe he is completely genuine when it comes to me. I think he just doing his job.
0.760000	I believe that my doctor has my back because that is his job.  He is competent and pragmatical, and he would undoubtedly explore treatment options with me.
1.000000	First of all I am generally healthy and go to the doctor twice a year for check ups and blood work evaluations. My doctor is very observant of my physical condition and the medication I take. He is approachable, invites questions, gives you good suggestions for improving your health.

I am so fortute to have a great doctor who is also a people person and is not going to treat you for something in a field where he is not an expert.
0.800000	My primary care doctor has always put my best interest first. He listens to my concerns and all my symptoms makes sure I have all the appropriate test ran in a timely matter and fully explains everything to me.

0.800000	My doctor has never given me conflicting or incorrect advice from what I can tell. He always spends a long time with me making sure that I have all concerns addressed. He is professional and courteous and I appreciate his work and attention.
0.200000	Now a days physicians could care less about patients its about money to them sadly to say...there isnt much more to say other than that
0.320000	No one should completely trust a doctor. He has an invested reason to tell you all these things that you can do without. His pockets get bigger when he gets you to do more things that are not needed. 
0.720000	I trust him to a point because he's a doctor but I don't trust him in a way because doctors aren't always right
0.840000	I really like my primary doctor and while I trust that my health is important and he is very easy to talk to, he doesn't explore some things as much as I think he should and I have to insist on him doing so if I think he's not understanding the severity of an issue. He does not truly understand me as well as my previous primary care doctor so can be quick to dismiss something that I know needs more attention.
0.560000	Sometimes my doctor doesn't remember my conditions and even though my chart is in front of him automated.  I have to remind him of my medical issues.
0.600000	I don't fully trust my doctor because sometimes I feel he just wants to get me in and out and like he doesn't take much time asking me questions. I have to always tell him I have some questions so he answers them, rather than him asking me if I  have any questions or concerns.
0.800000	never has given me a reason not to trust him seems open and honest if i ask something takes the time to explain
0.720000	in general, I prefer to do my own research. Doctors are only humans and can make mistakes and be miseducated just as anybody else could. I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on anybody for anything frankly.
0.520000	I am on the fence about this one. Not having a specific promo art care doctor, it is a hard question to answer. I broke my ankle in November and was bounced from doctor to doctor to physical therapist to cat scan to everything else under the sun - I never got a straight answer, regardless of how many times I asked, if my ankle was truly broken and if I was doing damage by every single doctor telling me to do something different. 
0.600000	My primary physician, sometimes I trust and distrust her at times. I don't really get what I need from her educationally when I'm there. 
1.000000	Every time I have had a problem and my doctor has given me a solution, the solution has been beneficial to me personally and my health. I have been seeing my doctor for over five years now and have not yet had any experience that would lead me to believe anything different. He will tell me what I can do to improve myself more  such as losing weight or referring me to see a dermatologist if I am having skin problems. He will not tell me something about my health if he is not 100% certain and I appreciate that. 
0.440000	My feeling towards them stem from a simply fact they only want there money. They provide only temporally fix to the issue just so you visit them again.
0.520000	He doesn't take time to listen to what is I am saying. He comes into the room, checks your breathing, look into your ears (only if asked) and then proceeds to write prescriptions 
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician although it sometimes hard to understand her. She is not from America. She is Indian.
0.760000	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE I DONT THINK HE WILL LEAD ME WRONG WHEN IT COME TO MY MEDICAL HISTORY OR PROBLEMS
0.800000	I have a general positive trust for my doctor. I don't think she'd ever intentionally give me misinformation or mislead me. I've never had a concern with this and feel like she's always helpful and informative.
0.640000	They are just doing their job and are human some times. They can forget certain things either due to stress or distraction from other cases or patients 
0.800000	My physician seems concerned about my health. She is willing to talk to me and takes my concerns into consideration.
0.600000	I dont always trust doctors because I feel like sometimes they just want to give us medicine without being sure what's really wrong.  They also rarely give ideas to help before giving the medicine.
0.800000	its a good person careful honest that gives me a good treatment an respect my point of view, i trust in my doctor very much
0.560000	I feel that my medical care providers are very well educated and i can tell, I think they have every motivation to to open and fair and honest with me because they have years of experience and they would not be in the position if they were not adequately helping patients
0.880000	I am a foreign war veteran who goes to two VA cliniics.Both of my doctors tell me the complete truth about everything and generally raelly care about my health and both clinics do great jobs in giving me the best treatment.
0.840000	I feel like my doctor would never lead me in the wrong direction when it comes to making decisions just based off past experience. Sometimes I don't always agree with his decisions and he knows that but we always do what we both think is best for me.
0.760000	So the surgery went incredibly well with only one nurse having poor bedside manner. The issue was the follow-up procedures. Radiation was all set up and ready to go before a sudden visit to the oncologist was scheduled. And we were informed that we were a month behind schedule. After that, suddenly radiation had to be pushed back over two months so four sessions of chemo could be forced through. We don't go to the first surgeon/general practitioner anymore. Apparently that's common with most surgeons: once they're done with you, you yourself don't need help anymore, even if you clearly do.
1.000000	my docter is very good at what she does. she knows exactly how to treat me. and what I need to do to stay healthy.
0.400000	"I never get the sense that my doctor really cares about me. I feel like she is just ""punching the clock"" and not engaged in my healthcare."
0.680000	I do not trust my primary care physician for many different reasons. First off, I believe he prescribes medication for even the smallest symptoms. This is usually not necessary, and most of the time just gives a financial burden. I also believe that they don't fully check your symptoms to check if it is something more severe, and rather just plays it off like its the flu and that it'll go away after a while. 
0.520000	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust regular doctors in general. Honestly, it depends on the person. If I have a gut instinct that the doctor doesn't really care then I will not trust them and if my gut tells me that the doctor is compassionate and really cares about the job I will trust them. 
0.680000	I don't currently have any health issues so there would be no reason for me to not to trust my doctor.
0.960000	My primary care doctor I trust because he test everything or look into everything have questions about 
0.720000	I feel like I have trust in my primary care physician. I feel like they have my best interests in mind and they try to solve any problem that I come to them for. They are really good at what they do.
0.960000	My physician knows what they are talking bout to help me in the best way possible. I rely on them more than anything if it deals with my health.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because she had been there for me and helped me through my problems. She is always very understandin and willing to listen to me. 
0.480000	the doctor i used to see,seemed to just want to prescribe more pills.even though the previous prescription didnt help.almost like he was guessing.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because all of the things I have gone in for over the past years have been small and mageable. My doctor is friendly and caring even under time constraints and has been candid but kind in regards to things like getting my weight down, etc. I trust that overall he has my best interest in mind. 
0.440000	Doctors in my life have shown an air of superiority when I have been discussing issues. To the point that I have to argue why I don't want a certain treatment or medication. They can act with blinders and not even recognize it.  
0.800000	My doctor has always shown me great care.
0.480000	Doctors don't really have enough time to deal with all the solutions that might benefit a patient, so I think the routinize things in a way that I don't trust entirely. For the most part, I do trust their recommendations are genuine and effective, though. 
0.640000	My doctor is rather trustworthy. He makes sure everything I came in about is checked and will answer questions and run relevant tests if he sees necessary
0.720000	Dr's goto medical school so they know their health. Sometimes people dont want to hear that they are sick so they might want to disagree with the Dr. to feel better in a sense of denial. I think medical school vs. no school its better to trust the dr.
1.000000	My primary care physician really listens to what I say. She remembers things about me from appointment to appointment. I really feel she wants me to be healthy and happy. 
0.520000	sometimes he go out of his way to help me get the medications or treatments that i need, so i trust him
0.960000	i believe they tell you the truth about everything and they are sincere and most of them are good doctors and treat there paitents very good i have a very good doctor who is always there when i need him
0.520000	He takes time with me, but I think he probably does not try very hard (probably due to dealing with people).  He does not seem to try to find the cause, just treat the symptoms.  I don't distrust him, I just trust my research more.
0.720000	I feel like I am going through an express line in the food line. I go in he asks me a few questions, write a prescription and that is it. They do not get to know you personally.
0.480000	I have not really found a good primary care physician yet. I had a good one, but he retired. The new one I have found so far has not impressed me. He is ok, but I don't feel as comfortable talking to him and sometimes feel like he jumps to conclusions about me or my condition without fully evaluating the information I have provided.
0.520000	I think has health care been decentralized and doctor are volunteer at places where health care are provided to those who needs it instead of running a business where hospital choose drugs based on relationship with companies and profit margin, and health care industries has become so large in the United States and it seems to be an ever self revolving perpetual growth by keeping the patient close to insurance and trip to hospitals, in other words, when health care is run as a business with insurance and pharmaceutical drug companies making profit, it is hard to discern whether physician's ethics or the paycheck determine the doctor's action.  And given the high health care cost of United States relative to other country when our health and quality of life is not correspondingly as high in ranking relative to spending, I think doctors, hospitals, are interdependent with insurance and pharmaceutical industries in term of making money.  it is kind of like asking someone whether they want to do something that would pay them double or do something that would reduce cost for patients while cutting their paycheck in half, what is the percentage of people do you think would choose the second option, considering doctors are also human
0.800000	As I mentioned earlier, I always wanted to be a doctor growing up and I even went as far as to enroll premed for 4 full time college years before I changed my mind.  I did not do this for money.  I did this because being a doctor always appealed to me.  I like to solve problems and the human body and what it is capable of astonishes me.  I like to think that most if not all doctors got into medicine for the same reasons.  They want to build that trust with their patients.  Without patients, they have no practice so I have to believe that they are to be trusted or else they would not have gone into medicine.
0.600000	Mostly I feel like I am just a number to them. They seem to always choose the most expensive procedures and treatments. A lot of medical professionals are arrogant and selfish.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician and most that I have visited in the past do not listen as well as they should.
0.840000	I've been seeing the same doctor for a long time. He knows by medical history very well. He's a very friendly man who doesn't rush through appointments, and really does listen to my concerns. I've grown to trust him very much and feel he makes good decisions for my health.
0.720000	I tend to trust Doctors that listen to my concerns more so than Doctors that talk at me with a know it all attitude.
0.520000	I think doctors miss a lot of things because they are trained to treat the symptoms and not the causes. They don't often trust that people know their own bodies.
0.760000	She listens does not make me feel in a hurry not many Doctors take the time to listen ,no useless test are done
1.000000	I trust that my doctor knows what is best for me. If he tells me something I have a disagreement on, I question his logic. I know my body pretty well and he knows that I give him all the information he needs to make a decision about treatment. I don't hold back and he doesn't either. 
0.480000	"I believe that many doctors rush through exams in order to get to their next patient and end their day and go home. this is not true of ALL doctors of course, but a great many I am sure it's true. I trust my doctor to see the glaring issues that are wrong and to suggest treatment for those, however, I would greatly push for more testing or ask more questions if I feel they don't ""get"" what I'm there for or if they seem to brush it off. Bottom line is that you need to be an advocate for yourself because these doctors see so many patients, they do not care on a personal level. You have to force them to see you as human and not a number in an office."
0.760000	I usually do research before going in to my doctor to get as much information as possible. My doctor encourages me to do so & is willing to explain reason for his/her choice. Rarely I'll insist on certain treatment types & my doctor will explain the risks, but respects my decision. 
0.880000	My primary physician has always taken good care of me. There has never been a moment where I even questioned him because he does his job diligently. I always leave his presence feeling better whether its because I've got medicine or a greater state of mind about my current situation. He has never given me a chance to doubt his capabilities. 
0.560000	My personal physician doesn't spend enough time durong y visit understanding my concerns. She abrupt and unprofessional
1.000000	I trust my primary car physician because he has been my doctor since I was born. 
0.240000	My primary care is a nurse practioner. I don't feel she has the qualifications to deal with the many serious issues I have. Her office is packed, the time with her is very short and she does not answer my most pressing questions.
0.800000	No matter what my condition was or is mu primary care physician was able to make a correct diagnosis 100% of the time.
0.800000	My primary care physician is very nice woman. She knows a lot, always friendly, and ready to give me any explation I need.
0.440000	i am aware of how they push medications that are provided them by certain pharmeceutical companies.  i also have witnessed first hand a doctor going to his office after assessing patient, and consulting with an encyclopedia to see what the patient has.  I think doctors are smart, but sometimes I think we give them too much credit.  They have to remember a ton of shit.
0.320000	I don't see the doctor frequently enough for them to know me or my health, so it'd be difficult for them to be particularly insightful. They are usually behind and seem very rushed. They don't really examine me or ask questions. They'll look at the part pertinent to the complaint that prompted the visit and prescribe the treatment I would have guessed I needed before I went in.
0.920000	I trust my doctor to give me what I should know about my health although you still have some douth no matter who
0.640000	If I don't understand something, I ask my doctor to explain it to me.   Afterwards, I usually follow up and research the issue more.   Rarely is my doctor incorrect in their explanations. In addition, they are able to provide referrals to good doctors (those respected in the community). My doctor also surrounds himself with competent staff.
0.880000	I've known my primary care doctor for a long time already. He is a family friend, the husband of my mother's coworker. As a result, my trust in him is very high. 
0.560000	"The reason I trust and don't trust doctors is because I feel that a large majority of them are financially driven and often give responses to clients/patients based off of biases. I also believe that even some honest doctors tend to sometimes fall victim to having to concede to company policy's and ""unethical"" medical industry standards."
0.600000	Some doctors I feel rush through the appointment and I leave feeling uncared for which is not the purpose for my visit
0.800000	I have been going to the same doctor since I was born and now my children go to the same one. She has always explained things clearly and given options and tried to do her best for us. 
0.760000	I'm with tricare. The doctors there aren't paid to push any specific brand of drugs. They have a lot of expertise in their field and see a lot of patients on a daily basis so their opinion carries a lot of weight. They aren't restricted by budget so much as other practices so they're more likely to recommend tests that other practices may have avoided.
0.920000	He listens to me, seems genuinely interested in what I have to say and my opinion on how I feel.  He spends an adequate amount of time with me and doesn't ever rush through  my appointment.
0.760000	My primary care doctor is a psychiatrist, and she does a good job of talking about both medical and non-medical treatments. She's good about explaining side effects and talking about realistic outcomes of treatment, and she knows it's important for me to feel like I'm not being pushed into making decisions.
0.680000	My doctor talks extensively with me about any feelings I may have regarding my health or treatment. I feel I can say anything to him or her (I have two physicians) about what I'm feeling or worried about, therefore, I feel I can trust them in my care & treatment.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He has never led me wrong so far.
0.760000	I have no reason not to believe that my doctor is not telling me the truth or trying to hurt me. I only have the upmost respect for my doctor.
0.520000	there have been too many occasions when the side effects of doctor's remedies have caused more and worse problems than the original purpose for seeking medical advice
0.880000	I have done a lot of research on my current doctors and have taken the necessary steps to be sure that I am being seen by competent and caring individuals. I trust their opinion and knowledge with regards to my healthcare. When I am seen by them I feel welcome and encouraged to speak about my concerns rather than rushed and ignored. 
0.600000	I trust my doctor because they have extensive training in their profession and the government makes sure they know their stuff.
0.800000	My primary care physician has my best interests and health in mind. He has always chosen the best options for the sicknesses that I had and brought me back to good health. I trust in his opinion and his explations of the issues that I deal with.
0.720000	I trust my physician because they are thorough. They seem to have my best interest at heart and will go out of their way to help me when i need additional help
0.760000	I don't distrust my primary care, but I often use others  opinions also, so I can get better ideas about whatever I get to treat
0.840000	My primary care physician has been efficient but thorough the last two years that I've been seeing her. She listens to my concerns, offers treatment options, and describes pros/cons of available options. Her manner is very pleasant and she balances speaking in vernacular terms and medical terms so as to neither come across as confusing or patronizing. 
0.760000	My doctor almost always explains everything she says in great detail, something which I very much appreciate. If she cannot do that, she will show me on the computer or from a book what she is talking about. So, any lack of trust I have is just myself being paranoid.
0.960000	My doctor takes the time to sit with me and make sure I understand what he is saying.  He has day with me doing research on medication and takes my opinion seriously. 
1.000000	My doctor has my best interest at heart. Why wouldn't she? If she did something that would cause me harm, she would get in trouble and potentially sued. She is a doctor because she cares about people and wants to help them.
0.640000	I am more apt to trust a doctor willing to listen and entertain my ideas as well. I don't want a doctor willing to take the first shortcut because that is what suits them.
0.560000	Reasons I trust doctors would be because they have more knowledge and experience in the medical field as well as medical problems. Reasons I distrust doctors, would be because sometimes they want to just prescribe medication instead of getting to the root cause of a medical condition.
0.800000	Well I think you have to trust that your doctor knows more than you do and is trying to do what is best for you. My doctor always explains all of my options and makes recommendations but still asks for my input as well. I trust he wants to do what is best for me.
0.880000	I trust them to stir me in the direction of wellness and find a cure to the issue. Do not have a primary physician.
0.480000	I don't trust medical professionals because sometimes they may be sponsored by a drug manufacturer, and they just perform medical services to promote their sponsors. Really don't trust doctors.
0.760000	I mostly trust my doctors because they know way more about the medical field than me.  However, doctors can definitely be wrong, which is why I didn't rate the statements above as 5.  Also, there can be some doctors that don't always want what is best for their patient, especially if it would cause too much of an inconvenience to themselves.
0.800000	I trust my primary physician because she knows me really well. She has been my doctor since I was 4 years old so she knows the ins and outs of all my health issues better than any other doctor. On a personal level, she has been there for me in times of need and has gone above and beyond her call of duty.
0.800000	the dr i have i had for years and so far hasn't given me a problem, had 3 different operations and no problems, to me even with the recommendation of a specialist, had no problems 
1.000000	I've been seeing my doctor for a number of years and she has never been anything but honest with me. If she doesn't know the answer to one of my questions, she will admit that and then help me find the answer. She always takes her time and goes over everything with me thoroughly, and I never feel rushed when I am in her office. She knows quite a bit about my persol life and always asks me about my family when I come in. I feel like we are friends.
0.600000	Doctors tend to just want to prescribe drugs whether or not you actually need them. It's how they're taught to do their job. 
0.760000	I have been going to him for a long time.He respects and knows what kind of person I am.He always Nswers my questions listens to me and helps in anyway he can
0.600000	I do trust my doctor and they do get second opinions about my healthif not more opinionsand more tests 
0.600000	"I have not seen this primary care physician that long and feel that they aren't as familiar with my background as they could be. I have also been denied certain medications that I feel I need just because they ""are not comfortable"" with prescribing them. I would have to go to a different doctor just for that then. I miss my ""old familiar with me"" doctor as well."
0.840000	My primary care physician is my uncle, so I've known him my entire life and certainly do not think he'd put any concerns above my health. Also because he's a family member I've had lots of people approach me who are patients of his to tell me how much they trust him as well. As a doctor, he's both extremely careful and reassuring, and very experienced.
0.920000	After numerous doctors that could not diagnose my conditions, I began seeing my current internist 5 years ago. After our first meeting she called me numerous times at home, sometimes in the evening to discuss past medical she found in my records. She always made time for me and what she could not do for me, she referred me to specialists where she monitors my care with each. My life and health are better as a result.
0.760000	I trust my doctor, although sometimes I feel patient care is just a revolving door to them. They see thousands and thousands every year, day an day out. Sometimes it is hard to get them to call you back or even schedule an appointment that has to be months away. I have seen a lot more younger doctors over the years that have more energy and stamina to take on new patients than the doctors that have been around for decades. There needs to be a change in primary care.
0.440000	I have a medical condition with my back that no doctor has yet been able to help with. The last doctor I saw about this had me as a patient for two years. I followed his advice, consented to treatments, and did everything as he wished it and got 0 results. At the end he decided that he didnt know what was wrong with me exactly and I stopped seeing him. It only took thousands of dollars in treatments for him to figure out that the cash cow was dry. 
0.920000	My doctor has always been very honest about everything...even if I might not want to hear it.  I feel like we have good, honest conversation and I feel comfortable discussing anything with him.
0.920000	He explains things well. I never feel rushed during a visit. He takes time to answer all my questions.
1.000000	My doctor has always listened to my complaints and assessed the problem and was able to help me.  I trust her completely
0.720000	The reasons why I trust my primary car physician is based on Previous experiences of this current and previous encounters with the medical field. 
0.760000	They seem kind and I have never had any issues with them. They come highly recommended. I have be given accurate diagnostics, advice, and medication for any illness I have had. 
0.800000	My doctor is very good.  He kind of reminds me of the 'old fashioned' type who would actually take on your health care.  I know that I still must stay tuned to my body and it's needs it's just nice having someone like Dr. Kang who takes it seriously.
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for many years.  he has known my conditions and has had them treated as they should be
0.600000	Doctors do not all have the same opinion. Best to always have a second opinion, or third. At least I would do this.
0.840000	I trust that the dr knows best for me they done there work to get where they are today they have more know more then I do 
0.480000	"At the moment my primary care physician is a nurses assistant, not an actual DR. thanks to my insurance.  She is kind of knowledgeable but at my last visit she had to ""Ask Dr. Google""  to answer one of my questions which not only worries me but is something I could do myself for free."
0.720000	I trust them because they have studied for care and have a valuable reputation. They let you know all the options available to you for treatment.
0.800000	I have an integrated health doctor. This one has been the best fitted for me. She listens to my concerns and we try alternative options before going straight to prescription meds. 
0.800000	He is a good doctor and has always given me the best care possible. He is always willing to see me on a last minute basis if I need to come in. 
0.760000	Because we've known each other for a long time now and all of the treatments I've done from him have had no issues up to this point.  I trust my doctor to make the best recommendations for me and keep me healthy.
0.800000	I have had good reviews from other patients who are my friends, and longtime patients of my doctor. He has never made me felt rushed and answered all my questions to my satisfaction.
1.000000	I have been with my PCP for 10 years. I have always felt like I could tell her everything, like being a lesbian and an alcoholic.
0.800000	My doctor has always spent the time with me that I need to help me with any issues I have.   I am comfortable with my doctor and his ability to help me.
0.600000	I had galstones in Sept. Of 2015 and my doctor thought it was an ulcer. This made me sicker for longer, and I couldn't get the care I needed. That's why I distrust doctors sometimes.
0.440000	They are in and out seeing in real quick, prescribe a medicine that costs an arm and a leg and come back in 4-6 weeks. And rumor has it, the doctors get a kick back from drug companies for drugs they prescribe. And they also schedule 8-12 patients at once so all patients wait and wait some more, frustrating yes
0.720000	trustworthy in the fact that i am willing to try new things and the availability of learning opportunities  
0.520000	I feel that sometimes my Dr. cares more about what's convenient for them instead of me. I also feel like they rush me sometimes or think just because they know me, I don't have any new issues. My Dr. is good b/c anytime I need to see him or her, I can always get a same day or next day appt. They also listen to what I have to say, whether or not I'm right or wrong
0.960000	My primary care physician makes decisions where we both have input in and both discuss what is best for me; he doesn't make a decision for me, we both work together. 
0.800000	He listens to what I say and asks questions to clarify. He remembers from visit to visit small details about my health issues. He does additional research when needed.
0.720000	Yes I trust my physician. I generally trust most people unless they give me a reason not to.
0.680000	For the most part I can trust my primary care physician, but I also like to do my own research just to be on the safe side. I trust him because he has helped me when I was sick in the past. 
0.560000	I just do I don't have that many things to say . I'm not a very talkative person. Sometimes I think they are in it for the money and cont really care about the patients.
1.000000	my doctor always explain any and all health concern to me  provides written material also incourage to search the web   
0.840000	I trusted my former primary care physician, but I didn't put all of my trust in him. God is first in my life and my trust is in Him, but to a certain degree I trusted my former primary care physician, because he always seemed to be honest in telling me about all different treatment options available and the results of my blood tests. 
0.600000	Doctors some times are required to focus on the bottom line and cost cutting rather than the well-being of patients. They do not necessarily want to do this, but in order to make a profit, they may have to. For instance, they may prescribe prescription drugs that are not necessary in order to bring in more of a profit. They may also give unnecessary tests in order to bill insurance companies. 
0.800000	i trust my primary care doctor because that's the doctor i've had since i was born. She has all of my medical records. So, its just easier to stay with her and trust her knowledge of me.
0.200000	I do not trust doctors because I have no reason to trust them. They are doctors because they went to school and got a degree. I trust myself much more.
0.360000	My doctor does not make me feel like they have my best interest fully at heart because the last time I went in for an ongoing, painful issue they ran tests and told me that they did not know what was wrong, that was it. No further follow up to figure out what the problem was. 
0.800000	They have not let me down. They have a lot of experience and they know what is best.
0.480000	I trust my doctor because he has known me since I was child. now that I am older its time for me to go to a another doctor it is hard for to trust people.
0.960000	My doctors have saved my life, and I believe that they do an outstanding job.
0.480000	He doesn't always look into what is wrong with me.  He just assumes. I'll tell him what it wrong with me and he will say oh well it sounds like this and that but doesn't do any kid of tests at all. Thats not OK to hold someone's life in their hands
0.600000	They don't really seem interested in what I had to say about my body and the side effects of the drugs i'm often prescribed. They sound like a shill trying to get me on many different medications
0.800000	I have been seeing him for many years he treats my children and spouse as well so we have discuses many things over the years and I am comfortable with him.
0.800000	I actually just met my PCP, but she came in having clearly read my file. She took a lot of time with me, didn't appear rushed at all. She had a good bed side manner. She gave appropriate recommendations and explained things well.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because when I come in asking about a condition or medication, she provides comprehensive guidance about why that might not be the best for me, as well as altertives. I feel that she's not just trying to placate me to get me out of the office or quickly move to her next patient. 
0.920000	I have had the same primary care physician for somewhere between 10-15 years.  Moreover, I have gone to the same practice for more than 25 years, so there is a good file built up of my records.
0.880000	I have went to the same doctor for a number of years and he has always listens to the questions I have. For example, if I need additional blood work or tests, he explains why this is necessary and what he is looking for. I trust his judgment and am appreciative of his care and concern.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because we went to the same school and he seems like an honest and reasonable guy that I feel that i can relate to. He understands that i have a good knowledge of my health
1.000000	My doctor is amazing. We have a great relationship and I fully trust her to tell me the truth and to go over everything with me.
0.880000	In the above I was talking about my OBGYN. I have to see him often for complications and cancer screenings. He is always straight forward with me, and has actually saved my life twice. 
0.800000	I have only know my newest primary care physician for about 6 months. My past primary care physician was used for almost a decade. I believe a relationship with a doctor is important. I'm not saying that will not develop with my newest doctor, but at the time total trust is not present. 
0.680000	My doctor is my friend as well as my doctor. I feel I can trust what advice she gives me most times, or at least I hope so. I am very comfortable with my doctor
0.720000	I would definitely trust my health care physician because they are the people I could ask help whenever I feel sick. My health care physician was the reason why i am still standing in this planet. I have a good relationships with her and also to my family since when I was young.
1.000000	She is very thorough. She's always trying to look for the deeper meaning of things in every visit. That's why I trust her.
1.000000	My doctor is a honest person. She would never lie to me.  I trust her completely. I know her. She is a very good doctor.
0.840000	I trust his expertise when it comes to health and what he has to say to me. Normally doctors have a great degree of training and experience. Now and then they may mess up but it is rare. My particular doctor i trust very much and he would always be honest with me.
0.480000	Honestly I think its more about money than care of the patient. There is never a sense of urgency with doctors. 
0.760000	I trust them because I've been going to them for years and no everything about me that I have been struggling
0.720000	i trust my physician because they Treating me with care and concernâ and âTaking your problems seriously.
0.600000	I think a doctor will do the best that they can do for someone or the best that a person will let the doctor do
0.480000	It is not so much that I distrust doctors. I just do not blindly trust them. I take what they have to say and go from there. I may have a differing opinion on what the best option is going forward. I also may agree with what they have to say and we are both on the same page. I think I ere on the side of caution. 
0.880000	He is the most well known and highly recommended doctor in my area. He is always extremely thorough and compassiote
0.840000	Has always taken time to listen and ask questions about my health and shows compassion. I feel like if he needs to he will refer me to a specialist.
0.440000	I distrust doctors. I have vertigo that is bothering me a lot, so I went to my primary care doctor who did not help me much other than giving me pills to see if they were effective. It was not effective at all. Therefore, He referred me to another specialist doctor in ears, throat and nose. That doctor did not do anything to help me other than trying to deceive me into buying one of the non-prescription medicines which I could get at a lower price at a local Walgreen. I feel so hopeless. All I wanted was to heal my vertigo. I still have it now, but I don't trust any doctors anymore.
0.800000	its hard to trust sometimes. sometimes they are just there for the money, and some really do care about you
0.560000	Sometimes, doctors are pressured into prescribing their patients with medication they really don't need. So, some doctors are honest and are straight-forward with their patients and some aren't. 
0.600000	I do in some ways trust my doctor or sometimes if they have a lot of patients then I am not as trusting
0.560000	a new Doctor that I have is trying too hard to be correct and not taking care of the human portion other job.
0.800000	i would trust most doctors. i only go to the gynecologist and optometrist, but they are both great. the only time i wouldnt listen to them is in regards to nutrition. 
0.680000	I just had my first appointment with my new provider so I don't know him well, but he was very thorough and organized, however when I told him my L4 dermatome below my knee was numb he googled it with me and as he was doing so said he didn't think that was the L4 dermatome. It was. Then he googled a few conditions in front of me and suggested I might have diabetes. I live a pretty healthy active lifestyle and have no other symptoms, and diabetes numbness usually starts in hands and feet and is tingly or painful. I am on a soccer team of physical therapists and they all checked me out and said it was likely a contusion or compression. My sister checked me out and said the same thing. I asked about diabetes and they all thought that was ridiculous. Why was he googling so many things in our appointment? Just say you're not sure, I don't expect you to know everything, but making things up, reaching, or googling diagnoses (which I already did more effectively, not webmd nonsense) doesn't instill confidence. But he seemed like he genuinely wanted me to leave feeling taken care of, and that's more than a lot of doctors.
0.600000	I more or less trust my doctor. I think it has primarily due to how she treats me. She's very nice and that inspires trust.
0.760000	I'm very frank and open with her and she is with me, which is what I would expect and this makes me feel safe.  She asks tough questions and doesn't beat around the bush, gets to the point, and is very directive in what she believes is best for me.  I like this about her and am totally open with her.
0.600000	I trust them as much a I distrust them. I  am not a paranoid person but I would like to understand what medical procedures are being done on me and what the effects will be.
0.560000	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with her for a long time. She remembers my name and is always very polite and seems generally concerned for me when I show up. Any questions that I asked are answered whole-heartedly and it feels she cares about me instead of just trying to get a bunch of my money through unneeded things.
0.800000	Usually he will tell me what i need to do to take precautions on anything and try to help when i am in a bind with medicine if at all possible.
1.000000	I have known my primary care physician for almost 10 years. He is a very honest person who believes in treating others with compassion. He would not knowingly harm or mislead his patients.
0.640000	I trust him because he has given me good direction with my health. He is a little blunt so at times he has hurt my feelings. However, he is a good doctor and has given me good medical care for years. I just thinj he needs to work on his bedside manners. He has been my family doctor for years. I trust his judgement on medicines and whats best for my overall health. 
0.680000	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE THEY GIVE THEM THEIR BEST TO  HELP  IN OUR WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY AND GOOD . THEY ALWAYS SUGGEST GOOD THINGS .
0.840000	i trust them because they are professiols
0.680000	I trust my doctor because they know more about medical things than me and if i knew what was wrong and how to fix it i wouldnt need a doctor.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because she gives me good medical advice that actually works if I stick to it. I was told to exercise to relieve my constant body aching. Exercising does work for me. I can tell the difference, in how my body feels, when I don't workout.
0.760000	I trust the doctors I have seen because they have spent time listening to me and fully answering my questions.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. I have never had a problem. They have always been nice and made me feel comfortable. 
0.880000	The Physician's Assistant that I see (I normally do not see the actual doctor) is very pleasant and seems caring. She does not seem rushed or like she is trying to hurry through the appointment. She also gives me the opportunity to ask questions about any diagnosis or treatment.
0.600000	I HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A DISTRUST IN DOCTORS.  HAVING CARED FOR AGING PARENTS AND A DAUGHTER WITH HEALTH ISSUES I FOUND MANY TIMES DOCTORS WERE NOT THOROUGH ENOUGH AND AT TIMES I FELT WERE GUESSING AT BEST.  DOCTORS ARE NOW TECHNICIANS AND NO LONGER HEALERS.
1.000000	I have been with the same doctor since I was a teenager and I completely trust him. I never   feel uncomfortable around him because, i know that, i can trust him.   I love my doctor and we share a very friendly relationship with each other at all times.
1.000000	If a doctor has great bedside manner it makes it easy to trust them. Most of the doctors I have ever been to have had a great bedside manner which makes it feel like they are there for me and not just to do what is convenient for him/her. A doctor that is rude makes it hard to believe
0.560000	I trust them to an extent. However, they are human, they make mistakes and they can't always devote full attention to every patient.
0.720000	My doctor is great.  He doesn't talk down to me because of my GAD and PTSD, and he listens to me.  He has absolutely no problem admitting that he doesn't know everything, and refers me to a specialist for things he feels are out of his field of knowledge.  He's also got common sense.
0.760000	I trust my doctor. I have been giving second opinions from other doctors that have confirmed what my doctor said. 
1.000000	I have noticed that she's gone above and beyond when she didn't have to so that makes me very comfortable with her. She also actually listens to what I have to say too instead of brushing me off.
0.440000	She acts as if she cares more about her world than mine. Sometimes she seems closed which discourages me in wanting to contact her about my issues 
0.800000	I have never had any issues with any of the doctors I have seen.  They have all seemed to empathize with my issues and appeared to care about my well being.
0.680000	I begin researching and then trusting. I rely on their experience and track record. I consider my visits and then form an opinion.
0.800000	I trust my doctor. I have my reasons for this. I trust my doctor because he will listen to me when I have questions that I need to ask. He is very generous and makes me feel like I'm important. I've been seeing my doctor for years now and never have I felt that I could not talk to him. I've been quite worried about a lot of things in the past and he has assured me that I was going to be alright.
0.840000	My doctor takes her time when I am there as though I am her only patient.  She asks questions and she makes sure she understand my symptoms and concerns.
0.800000	Because they have never given me any reason not to.  Up to this point in my life I have had very good doctors who care about me and my health
0.920000	I trust my doctor because he knows what's best for me, more than I know what's best for myself. As a trained Juliard physician who has a better understanding & working knowledge of the human anatomy, along with eight years of attending the best schools on a person's overall physical, mental or emotional health, I can rest in knowing that I can put my trust, and ultimately my life, in the hands of one who's more highly qualified as what's best for my continuing to live a long and healthy life. 
0.920000	My doctor has never steered  me  wrong or had me  do anything  without listening to my concerns . He  explains things to me in simple language.
0.280000	because my doctor has been inconsistent in his actions and negligent in his recommendations 
0.480000	I find most doctors I have dealt with to be very rushed. If I explain something poorly, they get the wrong idea and prescribe the wrong treatment. They don't have enough time to do good diagnosis. So I think the doctors are good people. I also think they don't have enough time to do their jobs well. Likely, they may not be as up-to-date as they need to be with medical science.
0.360000	Doctors are nothing more than amateur golfers who are also sales reps for pharmaceutical companies. They could care less about patient care and well being. They are only interested in getting you on prescription medications and having you come in to their office as often as possible while doing nothing beyond billing you and your insurance companies.
0.680000	"My doctor has a few quirks -- she is somewhat superstitious, and seems to believe in some ""old mother's tales"" regarding diagnosis methods.  On the whole, however, she seems to trust modern medical techniques more, although there are times when I worry about her judgement (""you must be a very jealous person -- you're quite ticklish"", said by her with little or not evidence that she is saying it as a joke, for example)."
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I have no reason to believe that he is dishonest.   I also have not been misdiagnosed in any way.   The only negative is that he is sometimes very busy and does not spend a lot of time with the patient.  The office is also very quick to push people to specialists.
0.760000	I trust my doctor to am extent. I know he has my best interests at heart. But no doctor can keep up on all the newest medical research. So I try to supplement with my own research
0.920000	I have been going to this same doctor for several years; I feel she knows me well. She considers my emotiol status as well as my physical status to determine the best course of treatment for me.
0.800000	I trust her because she actually takes the time out to listen to me when I speak to her about what is going on with me.
0.920000	I trust my doctor because I've had the same one since I was a child and haven't had any bad things happen through her.
0.640000	sometimes I think they take things out of control because everyone body is different and sometimes the things they said we should be taking it ends up making us worst or bad 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he has proven to be a good doctor. Throughout my visits total transparency, no nonsense. A doctor I trust to do the right thing and have.
0.920000	Sometime they are busy and don't have time to do complete assessment of the patient have a lot to do sometimes they work long hours
0.560000	It seems like they're always in a hurry to just prescribe me anything and get me out of there. They also don't really do thorough checks to figure out what is really wrong with me when I'm really sick. They just send me on my way to fast.
0.800000	She works with me on a care plan whereas most physicians that I've ever seen in the past just assume they know whats best for you and you don't get a say in the matter.
0.560000	I don't really trust anyone I just give them the benefit of the doubt,i have always had an issue with trust from child hood and it hasn't really changed very much since then.i like to figure things out for myself than have to really trust someone that don't really know me.
0.600000	I trust most doctors , but sometimes I want a second opinion   I want the doctor to seem confident in there response
0.600000	I trust my primary. I believe they would never tell me nothing wrong, or give me something that's not good for me. An the same goes for my kids. I have trust in my primary doctor, and believe he/she will not harm me and my family.
0.520000	"My doctor loves to golf and seems like that's his primary concern most times I'm there -- being able to get out of there early so he can hit the course. I call him a ""cough & cold doctor"". Basically he's good at that stuff, but for anything bigger I would prefer to see someone else (i.e. a specialist). I don't necessarily distrust him I just don't think he cares enough to dig deeper into things. He does what he has to to just barely get by."
0.920000	I have been with this doctor for over 10 years and no matter what he always treats me with respect and kindness. I have a lot of faults such as my struggle with my weight and depression and bipolar. He gives me options, but does not shame me. 
1.000000	Speaking to my doctor is like speaking to a family member. He's very open and honest, but has a very warm bedside manner. He makes me feel very relaxed, and I know he always has the best suggestions for my health and well-being.
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I feel that would have more knowledge than me in medical situations that I present to them therefore know how to handle those situations.
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I truly think they are looking out for me. I have friends who are nurses and they have all told me they've never seen anything to have them question a physician's judgement.
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for such a long time now that I trust them. They have never done me wrong and always help me out when I have a problem. 
0.960000	In my case, my primary care physician is also a good personal friend that I've known since before he was my doctor.  We built a relationship of trust before we had a business relationship and that has carried over into seeing him as a doctor.  Any time I have had an issue I have honestly expressed it to him and he has given me straight answers on what my options are and what the possible outcomes were.
0.560000	In general I almost never just trust one opinion from one physician. Specially if they are older as there is a chance that they are not up to date with the information (speaking from personal experience). I prefer always getting a second opinion and do my own research to learn as much as possible.
0.520000	I don't have a doctor, or see one regularly, I only go when I have a problem. So I'm just not going to trust some random doctor I've never met before, especially when my money is on the line.
0.960000	Very likeable doctor. Really wants me to be in good health. I am overweight and he wants me to work on that.
0.760000	My doctor is older and experienced. He is down to earth. He knows the answers to most of my questions. He is encouraging.
0.560000	Don't have a primary care doctor now but when I did I was never sure if he knew what he was doing. He once ruined a trip for me with a bad diagnosis.
0.680000	Doctors are there to help figure out what is wrong with you with the information you give them the more correct information they have the better the results. Most of the time they just give the brugs that is design to help the problem that you have 
0.840000	my doctor has always shown compassion and caring for me. im never rushed 
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician because they are very friendly, understanding, caring and helpful. They always make me feel comfortable asking questions and such. They also always keep my best interest in mind, and making sure I am comfortable with everything before proceeding.
1.000000	I have been with my doctor for 18 yrs and sge always accomodates my needs with fitting me in for appointments when I am not feeling well and explains my medical conditions and prescribes medications and treatments that improve my quality of life
0.800000	I have been with my primary care physician for five years now and she has always steered me in the right direction. I feel I have total trust in her and always listen to and follow what she says. 
0.600000	Sometimes, I think doctors are so rushed to see as many patients as they can, they don't spend enough time getting to know them in order to properly treat them.  This can cause them to miss vital things necessary for proper treatment.
0.840000	The practice of doctors is efficient.  They listen to my concerns, address them immediately, and strive to anticipate normal concerns and cover them.  They take an active interest in my overall health, not just in the complaint presented at appointments.  They are holistic in their care, and every doctor in the practice is comfortable with my chart and my needs.  They are all capable of helping and caring.
0.800000	i trust doctor in how they perform and how they work with patient's in their medical condition. All doctor's follow their protocol on patient.
0.760000	He is a good doctor. He tries to make comfortable.  Good staff, nice offices. I can usually get in and out without crazy long waits.
0.640000	My primary care physician has a large practice which makes it difficult to believe he's spent the appropriate amount of time reviewing my case. There have been times when the diagnosis he has given is completely wrong and the treatment provided only causes more harm.
0.600000	It is not that I don't trust doctors , I'm a little wary. I do also ask many questions and I don't like to be rushed
0.680000	She listens to my needs and trys to get to the root of the problem and orders tes%s if applicable and she if affiliated with the neareat hospital
1.000000	I feel my doctor genuinely cares about my health. States concerns, followsup, suggests programs or solutions.
0.720000	I do not generally trust or distrust people, doctors included.  It depends on the individual doctor, the condition/issue, the degree to which that professional is (or is not) already behind schedule, on overload, in a hurry, worried, etc.  They are human, after all.  My doctor is quite thorough; in part I suspect it is her way of assuring she stays on track and covers everything though it sometimes seems to be at a cost to whatever my particular agenda might be during a given visit.  We have worked it out that she does her routine questions and I bring a list of my issues, so both of us has time.  This seems to be effective, though it would be wasted in a rotating medico situation where one did not see the same physician regularly.
0.640000	the truth I do not distrust any doctor if they are in the position they are because something they did well I do not think they have failed
0.760000	My Dr is a great lady. She is baptized, filled with the Holy Ghost and really cares. on top of that she is beautiful inside and out. For the first time in a long time I am actually starting to fill better even though I have copd, Praise God
0.680000	As a patient, you have probably had the experience of meeting a physician for the first time and very quickly becoming comfortable that he or she has your very best interests utmost in mind. The sense comes quickly; you become comfortable, less anxious. Unfortunately you may have had the opposite experience of encountering 
0.440000	I do not see my primary care doctor very often. I feel like my once a year checkin is not enough for me to build a relationship. 
0.720000	My doctors have informed me when things are not right and what I need to do to get it right. At the same time I do not like medicine and would prefer to find the appropriate food that has that particular medicine I need.
0.760000	If I didn't trust my physician, I would change to another physician.  I have stuck with the doctors I have because I have developed a trust for them and their judgement.
1.000000	My doctor is very good at his job. He's also very honest with me. He works hard to help me stay healthy no matter how much work it is for him. That is why I trust him completely. 
0.800000	I trust doctors because when I do have to see them they are always willing to answer all of my question. I have not had any issues with a doctor not spending enough time with me to makes sure I understand all the options available to me. I haven't had a doctor make a poor decision in my healthcare.
0.720000	I have a reasonable amount of trust in my primary care physician, but I am not afraid to ask for and make sure I get a second or sometimes even a third opinion if I dont agree with what my pcp is saying.
0.200000	I don't have a primary care. In the past all they have done is make my problem worse, not better. American medicine for the most part is just another way to make money.
0.840000	I generally trust the doctors that I see because I respect their knowledge and experience. This is particularly true when I see specialists about a particular condition. I have faith when seeing a specialist that they have seen many patients with my condition and that they will be able to quickly find a cure or method to manage the condition. I also try to use this opportunity to ask general questions about the condition to them, which I believe is more informative than if I searched online on my own.
0.280000	Doctors always try to rush, don't actually make sure you're all the way okay until you come in with a disease, and go to what they tell others when telling you how something happened and dismiss your actual lifestyle.
0.560000	Through my husbands insurance (which I have no choice over) I just feel like this set seems not to care to much about the patients.  They seem not to want to listen to me.  For example: when my back was hurt and I could barely walk.  They did an x-ray but they did not see anything on it.  They acted like it was all in my head and that my pain was not real.  I could barely walk for over a month.  I lost trust in my doctors.
0.520000	I feel like if I tell you there is something wrong then you should believe me. My doctor is pretty good at checking out whatever my issues are. He will have me to try to things at home to help before taking more invasive measures.
0.400000	For the most part, I do trust my primary care physician.  I believe the physician has my best interest overall.  That being said, I still question my doctor on certain decisions to make sure I agree with the decision.  I am not afraid to question my doctor or do more research about certain decisions my doctor wants me to follow.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because i have known them my entire life. I can understand some people not trusting doctors in general because it seems a lot more of them these days are just trying to make every dollar they can off of their patients. 
0.800000	what with all the writing questions enough ok, my doctor is the best and has been for a long time but is retiring and that is a bumer
0.400000	It's just one person, and a single person can be wrong despite having good intentions. I would much rather know the opinion of multiple doctors or people with experience.
0.760000	HE HAS BEEN RIGHT SO FAR, HE KNOWS WHAT IS KINDA THE BEST FOR ME. HE IS TRUST WORTHY. HE HAS BEEN A DR FOR MANY YEARS AND IS UP TO DATE ON THINGS
0.680000	I trust my doctor and their diagnosis because I feel that they take the time to listen to my symptoms.  They also take time to evaluate my problem areas and run the necessary test to get a proper diagnosis.
0.800000	I trust my doctor or physician because they know there jilob that's what they study for and that's what there a profession in so they most likey know what there doing 
0.800000	I trust my doctors because I have been going there for some time. They listen to my concerns and thoughts then add their input. If I disagree with something they say they will listen and try to find a better altertive. I do what a doctor tells me is best to do.
0.800000	I do trust my doctor for the most part.  I know that not a lot of doctors study nutrition or altertive forms of medicine so I also study on that to and make my own decisions.  My doctor is very thorough and seems to care about me.  I feel comfortable talking to her.
0.600000	I trust my doctor because my whole family has been going to her for years. I've known her since I was a little kid and now i'm 35. She knows everything about me and she knows how to talk to me.
0.880000	I have seen her for a long time and she's consistently shown a lot of care. She always listens to my questions, even the seemingly silly sounding ones, and answers honestly.

1.000000	I have found my primary care physician to be a very good listener who asks pointed and relevant follow up questions. He also takes into account my experiences with various medicines and treatments when prescribing tests and/or new medications. 
0.560000	All doctors tend to have their own way of doing thing and thinking about issues. I feel like it is safe to say that they do not know everything and can be wrong just like anyone else.
0.960000	Always takes the time to explain things in detail and answer questions, never rushes me and believes in finding the cause and not just treating the symptom
0.640000	I have some trust in my primary care doctor, but don't have 100% faith in him when dealing with other than really basic care issues. On the other hand, he is more than happy to refer his patients to specialists. It is almost like he is aware of his own limitations.
0.800000	My primary care physician has been giving me care for many years. He is a family friend and has always been competent and attentive to my needs as a patient. 
0.480000	Doctors are paid to tell you what they think you want to have done.  They don't really care about what is best for you, they want you to do what is going to make them the most money.  They are also paid by pharmaceutical companies to push certain drugs on you that you probably don't need.
1.000000	I fully trust my primary physician. He has been treating me since I was a teenager.  He is very much concerned about my overall health and he displays it every time I visit him.  He makes sure that I am up to date on all of my annual and routine tests and evaluations. 
0.800000	I trust him because of the history i have with him, between having a baby and him understanding my health goals, it helps to have someone who knows your body and the required things it needs to feel better or well.
0.960000	I have a basic knowledge of the medical field, they went to school for this, therefore their knowledge trumps mine.
0.400000	At the end of the day it is their job and duty to ensure that i get the help i pay for so i am generally rather trusting of them and their judgement
0.840000	I trust my doctor she has been a friend and Dr I can Tell her anything she is straight forward with me
0.640000	I don't have complete trust in my doctor - but I would say I trust most of what they say. I am not too big on vaccines anymore, although my daughter does get them as a safety precaution. I don't always trust the meds I am given because sometimes if I suggest something the doctor has said no out of spite. And then a few months later we try the medication I originally suggested and it works great (I am mostly talking about psychiatry there - psychiatry/psychology is a hobby of mine, luckily I have a great psych doctor now!)
0.720000	He has been around for many years. And has been appointed the doctor for the pittsburgh Steelers for a long time.
0.800000	I have a good relationship with my primary care physician.  She is thoughtful, caring and provides me with all of the information I need in order to make decisions regarding my care.

I trust her judgment and she knows that if I question or disagree with something she says we can discuss it in more depth and reach a mutual understanding.
1.000000	I trust my doctor because they have my best interests at heart because they know what is best for me.  The doctor tells me what I need to do because they care about me and my needs.  My doctor is very caring and they treat me correctly and very professionally.
0.760000	"In general, I trust doctors. In the area where I live we have a good selection of doctors and health professiols to choose from so it is in their best interest to provide quality health care.  With the abundance of information available on the internet, people often use that information to get a ""second opinion"" of what doctors tell them as well."
0.680000	I believe that many doctors will run unnecessary tests to make a quota set my their practice.  For instance, a dermatologist may do a biopsy when there is not a good reason.   
0.760000	I trust her because I think and hope that she has my best interest at heart... There's always a 24 hour hotline just in case I need help in the middle of the night. She's always supportive
0.600000	In all honesty, I do not currently have a primary care physician as I do not have health insurance. In general, I do trust the health profession however
0.360000	I used to trust my doctor until last summer.  I took my son to see the Dr. and he said he just has an infection take these pills and get some rest.  I trusted my gut and took my son to the ER and found out that he was a type 1 diabetic and he almost died because the doctor did not diagnose him properly, he spent a week in the hospital recovering.

0.560000	I am moderately trusting of my physician, I'm confident there are some motives behind what she recommends that are not 100% in my best interest and I try to be mindful of that.
0.720000	Doctors in general are trustworthy because they have a career to uphold. If they were to mess around with you, they could lose their license, or be subject to a huge lawsuit. It's important that doctors uphold the hippocratic oath, or else they won't be around long. You have to trust that you wouldn't be an unlucky few who are are exposed to a terrible doctor. 
1.000000	My primary doctor has been my doctor for almost 10 years. She is the most caring, loving and thoughtful doctor I have encountered. 
0.600000	I generally trust my doctor although not blindly because they are human and therefore prone to mistakes.
0.400000	Many doctors follow the western methods of treatment: cut, burn, poison. Still others, are constrained by the medical system they are in.
0.760000	Because I do feel that sometimes doctors pushes way to much medicines
1.000000	She has known owe a long time. She knows what is best for me. She is very knowledgable about my health.
0.840000	My doctor has been very helpful by working in conjunction with me to address any health issues that I have had. She listens to my concerns and understands that I am an involved patient. Because she listens to my input, I trust her to work with me toward responsible health goals.
0.760000	I think doctors usually try to give the best care possible, although sometimes there may be other options available.
0.800000	I would rather select slightly agree but that's not an option. I've only been seeng this doctor for over a year. About 4 visits because the doctors sometimes rotate or finish their residency. I have to be my own advocate and never completely trust someone with your life in their hands without doing a little of your own research first.
1.000000	I completely trust m doctor! She is very kind and compassionate. She always takes the time to listen to my concerns carefully. She will in turn offer her professional advice to me. She even stays around to have a few minutes of small talk when we are finished. She's absolutely great! 
0.960000	We have known him for over 20 years and two wonderful children and he has never been wrong with us. We trust him with our lives and children
1.000000	My primary care physician is a really responsible and nice person. Actually, the doctors I saw in general are responsible and nice. Based on how they treated me every time, very professiol and knowledgeable; how they spent time explaining things to me, answering my questions with great patience, even stupid questions sometimes. If I have problems with meds or my symptoms, I can call their offices and get quick responses. I will get a phone call reminding me about my upcoming treatments and appointments. I feel that I can completely trust them to take care of my health.
0.400000	Doctors do not have a clear idea about culinary meds. They also usually gove out what ever the RX companies push and give them a kickback for using. 
0.840000	I do not thoroughly trust my primary physician I trust my cardiologist the most especially since I had a heart attack last month and a double bypass,I don't feel like my primary physician was doing all he should have prior to my having a heart attack  
0.760000	I mostly trust my doctor because I know he is honest and he has not steered me wrong yet and I've gotten better from illnesses and he seems to care 
0.600000	I have faith i God and i trust that God will lead me to best physician for me who knows my condition if and or when i have one. I believe that dr.will be completely effecient in treatment care for me. Im optimistic snd prayerful
0.680000	I don't fully trust one of my primary care doctors  because my bills are always really high. It's like she just orders every test she can possibly find even though it's not necessarily needed. If you tell her you don't do well with certain meds she'll say that she thinks they're better than the kind you do well with.
1.000000	my primary care physician works with me to get me the best treatment possible as far as I'm concerned
0.600000	All my trust is and will remain in God.  I only trust Him an if He assigns a doctor for me I believe that he will use her in a honest way.
0.800000	I trust the doctor and I rely on their education and experience.
0.440000	It's obvious that my primary care physician, and all the other doctors in that office in general, is ridiculous overworked and overwhelmed.  When I do go see her, I can expect to regularly wait 2 hours past my scheduled appointment time to even see the doctor, only to have her rush through our meeting in 5 minutes and rush me out.  The waiting room for my primary care physician's office is always filled to the brim with waiting people, many of which sick and coughing.  My doctor means well but she is clearly overworked and unable to give me her best.
0.800000	having been with my primary care doctor for years, following his directives i have remained healthy.  
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician for 100%. We have a relationship for 3 years now where I have been through some health problems. She has always helped me on a basis of honesty and telling me openly what the options wheree. She also gave me a great deal of input in the decisions that had to be made.. 
0.560000	I trust him because when I see my blood lab results they are in line with what he says so i know hes honest.
0.760000	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been able to help me. I have been going to the same doctor since I was a teeger.
0.440000	He is always pushing me to have surgery. when my back hurt he said surgery, I said physical therapy and the therapy fixed it. he now says I need knee replacement now, but when I went to the orthopedic surgeon, he agreed with me and put me in physical therapy and I am much better. 
0.400000	I had a new PCP the last time I visited the doctor. I was not pleased with her performance. I am now awaiting an appointment with a new PCP.
0.960000	I always trust my healthcare provider , and I choose wisely.I would not go to someone I don't trust.
0.840000	I trust my dr because he or she has been studying Medicine and the human body and if I give them all the information about myself I believe they can make a honest decision on what to do about the problem I have at the time. 
0.680000	They work very hard throughout their lives to become doctors. I have much faith and trust in them to stick to their oath. 
0.280000	I've had many bad persol experiences with physicians in the past. Several have initially denied treatment because they didn't think their patient (my wife) was acting in enough pain for her condition that they eventually correctly diagnosed and medicated. Many have been uble to diagnose fairly common conditions. One LITERALLY told me the video game Street Fighter caused demons to come out of my TV and give me a skin rash that was later properly diagnosed as scabies. That is not a joke, or me having a go at the survey. That actually happened. Many doctors only seem to care about money, many don't care about their patients. I have had a few positive experiences as well, but as I lack a permanent primary care physician I've not had many positive experiences.
0.600000	I don't distrust my physician. However, they are often rushed to get to the next patient so I don't always trust that they are being as thorough as possible.
0.840000	I have went through hip replacement serg and my Drs were very helpful, explaining everything to me. I trusted what they had to say and I followed their advice

0.760000	I trust my doctor because he usually thoroughly explains everything to me, and is able to answer any questions that I may have. He also explains pros and cons for treatments and helps me to choose what is best for me.
0.520000	"i dont have a close relationship with my dr because im relatively healthy. So i only see her once a year. I dont even think she really remembers me. I think she just does a cursory job at my physical. I have had one health problem recently (gall bladder) she just said ""have it out"" she didnt discuss any other options she just referred me to a surgeon."
0.640000	I do not trust physicians in general because I believe that they are mostly out to make money and keep people on drugs. 
0.640000	I hardly ever see a doctor because my health  clinic has mostly nurse practitioners.  I do trust their judgement but they don't have the experience and training that doctor's have.  When I ask to see a specialist it very seldom happens unless I keep asking.  In conclusion I trust my nurse practitioner in general but would like to see a doctor sometimes.
0.640000	Doctors are human. Most of them are careful and want to help their patients. Some are better at keeping up-to-date with the newest best practices than others. So, depending on how many doctors are in your area and how good your insurance is, most people who can afford medical care can find a decent doctor who keeps their best interests in mind.
0.720000	I've had a couple I have trusted and a couple I have not. My last physician in Hawaii I trusted a lot. I went in with severe pain in my intestines. The nurse wanted me to immediately go to the hospital for a colonoscopy. The doctor asked me some questions, looked at my medical history, and came to the conclusion that I had a non serious condition that could be treated with antibiotics. He gave me the choice of accepting his recommendation or going to the hospital. He explained the pros and cons of each. He gave me reasons for his recommendation and I went with it. He was correct in the end.
1.000000	He knows me, been a patient for years and never had a bad experience. He is kind, a Christian and I trust everything he says.
0.960000	I have been going to the same primary care physician for many years, probably at least 20.  I have always trusted what he has said about my conditions because they correspond with the test results I have received.
0.720000	My primary doctor is an associate professor at a large teaching hospital. He takes the time to listen to me.

0.720000	I trust my doctor because I feel he has no reason to deceive me. I give them good money to be told the truth and guided in the right direction regarding my health.
0.360000	My insurance isn't great and I have to go to a very low cost doctor whom I don't have a lot of trust in, to be frank. She has often told me things that I outright knew were wrong (e.g.: continuing to tell me to take St. John's Wort after being prescribed Prozac, rinsing out a dog bite with hydrogen peroxide). It makes me wonder if the things she tells me that I DON'T know are wrong are correct.
0.840000	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest with me. If I had any problem in the past he always told me my options and explained the consequences. 
0.800000	My doctor is very nice but also tells me exactly like it is. She does not go over board on testing, but provides what is necessary and I don't have to second guess what she is telling me. She allows me to ask questions and voice any concerns I may have and also thinks about how costly things would be for me.
0.560000	I have a new doctor, this is my first primary physician outside of my pediatrician. I believe it will take time to fully understand and trust each other.

0.600000	I trust my primary care physician for the most part, I have only meet her once. I am still working on putting my complete trust in her. I completely trusted my previous doctor since I had been with her for many years. Switching made me uneasy. But I trust in her and her education.

0.800000	I have been knowing him for awhile. He has a very great understanding of everything medical, and he has a great bedside manner. 
0.800000	The doctor I have now asks about the family and seems to remember things about them. Seems to care about me taking care of myself. That comes across in his tone and approach to the visits.
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician.  I have been seeing her for 17 years so I completely trust her as a doctor. 
0.280000	My primary health care told me not to read the inserts that come in your medicine telling you about side effects, they were for lawyers only
0.400000	With the current changes medical insurance I feel doctors utilize their Nurse Practitioners more often. Doctors want to rush you out of the office and prescribe medication more often then necessary.   
0.200000	Well I dont feel like he uses enough wholistic techniques only knows medication. He isnt thorough enough. I feel like he looks at physical appearance and then does basic tests.
0.720000	My doctor is a good and caring doctor, and I do feel he has my best interests at heart. However, I can tell he is busy and overscheduled.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician.  I usually do not trust them.  Not really into doctors. Doctors will lie
0.640000	I trust my current physician. I just recently had a problem and my new doctor actually did all they could to find the problem. All of my searching and information I had from myself they ordered all those tests and asked all the right stuff that matched up so I trust them now.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because we have had a successful patient-doctor relationship for about 5 years now. She has been open and honest about my condition and whatever treatment plans we may pursue for specific conditions. She tells me about the benefits, the side-effects, and what she thinks may be best for me. She also welcomes my input and will change our treatment plan based on what I tell her. I feel that I can tell her anything.
0.200000	It seems like doctors only want to pass out pills. That is a bandage and dose not resolve your problem and has side effects
0.640000	I think he does what's best for me, but then he refers me to other who just want to make money off of me

0.880000	 I trust my doctor as he has never steered me wrong.  I have no reason to believe that he would or that he would be not being honest with me.
0.480000	The physician i see most often is my pain clinic nurse practitioner. I see two different guys and they contradict each other at least once every two months. It is hard for me to trust what either of them say because neither seems to be interested in healing my problem, only covering up or masking the problem. We have reached a wall and the only other option that could be recommended would be surgery but one physician feels I am too young and not in enough pain. Nothing either of them have done has worked to help my pain so it is hard for me to feel confident in any of their suggestions.
0.600000	"What I would say is I trust science and how it develops information, which can inform decisions. Through persol experience in seeing how doctors have misdiagnosed my family members and in hearing numerous stories of similar situations from family and friends, I would say doctors often don't care about good outcomes for their patients as much as they should. They can seem uninterested, cold, and have little involvement in the actual ""caring"" part of health care. That being said, I know there are many good doctors who do care, though many may be overworked and somewhat desensitized. "
0.360000	If my doctor would try a little harder and ask the questions this survey has,  he might understand me more.  Instead he will ask two questions prescribe a pill and send me on my way.

0.720000	I trust them to do the very best they can do and get the training that they have watching out for people and do what they can. Plus the fact theres other people ariund to nurses and assistance to watch 
0.640000	I believe that for the most part physicians have their patients' best interests in mind. However, because of the economics of healthcare in this country a patient's interests might not always be met.
0.680000	Sometimes my doctor recommends treatment that she is familiar with. I prefer to take a holistic approach to my health. I prefer to try more natural alternatives and see most prescription medications as a last resort.
0.480000	I honestly don't have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I say that mainly because I haven't had a lot of interaction with him. In addition to that my interactions that I've had with him have not been really positive. I've felt rushed in those interactions and I don't get a sense of him really caring about well being of his patients.
0.800000	I have a relatively good experience with the doctors I've visited. I made sure to ask close family and friends about certain doctors they visited and which ones to avoid. I was able to draw conclusions from there.
1.000000	I trust my primary care doctor because he told me things straight up and had no problem explaining anything to me and told me things other doctors probably wouldn't even mention. My doctor is very trust worthy in my eyes.
0.560000	It makes me very uncomfortable that doctors can receive 'kickback' payments from drug manufacturers to recommend their products.
1.000000	He is always very frank about any health issue he has to address with me. He is kind,considerate and professional.

0.480000	I don't know her well yet, and I've only seen her three times. Also, I prefer natural medicine when possible, which medical doctors tend to stay away from. 
0.520000	I don't know my doctor well enough to give any specifics.  Since I'm pretty healthy we haven't needed to have a relationship other than wellness checkups and a few tests.
0.280000	I will never trust anything in this medical system ever again. It is as simple as that.
0.680000	I trust them because they help me wnrx never gave me a reason not to trust them on anything and yes I just trust them and their kindness and there will to help me in my problems

0.960000	I typically trust my doctor and am not afraid to raise concerns if I do not agree with something she says or does.  She typically puts my concerns first and knows that I like to weigh all of my options when it comes to making any decisions.  I am not afraid to find another doctor if I do not agree with the way any of my medical problems are being handled and any doctor I see I make sure and let them know.
0.760000	Doctors are educated and qualified when it comes to health advice. I think that they would have no reason to not help me in the best way they can.

0.960000	She maybe be running behind but she never acts like she  is rushing through my appointments.Take the time to answer questions and explain the best treatment for me.  
0.960000	Because of the way the Doctor thoroughly explains to me so I can understand what he is saying and he takes his time with me and answers all my questions and concerns

0.960000	My PCP is thorough, honest, and caring. She makes sure is accurately and completely explains everything. 
0.880000	My primary care physician is very through and takes the time to listen to me and explain any options.   
0.720000	Primary physician seems balanced in giving medical care and treatment. Not too emotional. Intelligent. Bilingual or more. Stands her ground.
1.000000	He is a board certified doctor. He has over 40 years experience in the field. 
0.800000	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, and the care I get from her is always excellent. I am able to ask questions and get answers when I need to and she is never rushed or indifferent to my needs.
0.600000	The short reason why I will not blindly trust a doctor is that they aren't infallible, and I've been on the receiving end of a bad doctors misdiagnoses and paid the price for it. So yah, not gonna trust anything blindly. 
0.800000	My doctor has given me pretty good advice at my annual physicals without being overly pushy or forward about it. He's personable and laid back and seems to have my best interests at heart.

0.640000	I just established a primary care physician not to long ago so I am still gaining that trust. So far it seems like she is trustworthy and really wants the best for me. I have heard good things about her which is why I decided to establish her as my pcp 
0.760000	I feel doctors truly care for their patients and want the best for them.
0.680000	I generally trust my doctor but sometimes I think he just does what is easy and convenient rather than what is necessarily best for me. I feel pretty good overall about trusting my doctor.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician. Because he went to school to gain knowledge to help people and I truly believe he trys to do what he thinks is the best to help me and learn what will be the best to help other people as well sometimes doctors have to try different approaches to get the best outcome that will help each individual overall. 
1.000000	My primary care physician is always patient with me and does not seem rushed. He is very clear in his explations of his diagnosis and how to move forward no matter the issue. He is able to provide trustworthy and good recommendations in my experience. 
0.960000	She has always been correct in her medical treatment of me. I have had no complaints where she in concerned.
0.800000	I have developed a strong relationship with my primary care doctor. I have seen him for many years now and he has been successful at helping me through various illnesses with success. 
0.520000	I do not trust one of my physicians because even though I feel pain I always get the feeling that because they know nothing is broken I shouldn't be in pain or as much pain as I say I am. Also they give presriptions that either don't last long or just not work at all. I Do trust them because I am referred to them by my parent and some of my other physician are much more different. 
0.800000	Docs are only human, by definition they are not perfect.
0.720000	My Doctor has a degree and knows what he is doing , When he is doing surgery on me he is in control I am a sleep and give him all my trust. When he orders medication I trust him to do whats right
0.600000	I'm sorry but I didn't mean you didn't know that you didn't know me what I was doing lol lol okay okay I'll just try it to you say bye to the princess of the princess lol I don't want to talk about 
0.640000	I think that the medical profession has a rrow view of the patient and does not look long term.  It is ultimately up to me to decide on the course of action in my healthcare, after taking the advice of the doctor with a grain of salt.  I do not wholly believe that the doctor knows what is best for me after a brief office visit, only I can know and make this decision.
1.000000	I trust doctors to help patients make the decisions. I believe that most doctors care about the well being of their patients. I believe that very few doctors are in the profession for themselves. 
0.600000	Because it seems as if when you want to learn something they don't to tell you anything and I want someone who would be more open and honest about any situation that I may have in my life 
0.800000	Ive known him and have been seeing him for a long time. I have no problems telling him exactly what bothers me. I trust him to be right most of the time.
0.920000	My primary care provider is always careful in prescribing medication, since I take so many of them (20+ prescription meds). She listens to my concerns, is always thorough in her examination of me, and never makes me feel like I'm just another line item on her checklist. While I've been treated by everyone at the practice, I like her the best.
0.720000	I have been with them for awhile so I feel confident that they can get the job done right and will provide me with the proper care and diagnosis.
0.840000	Sometimes I don't think he tells me everything I should know. It seems the doctor knows everything about you but is unwilling to tell you what he knows. The seem to hide your charts from you and sometimes never tell you your blood pressure or really how you are doing.
0.800000	My PCP has always been nice and caring.  I don't have a reason to not trust him or doubt him.  Everything has always worked out well.
0.640000	I trust my physician for the most part but I do believe that they sometimes do things out of convenience for themselves 
0.440000	He has his head in his laptop more than he looks at me, he doesn't talk or explain things anymore, I am changing doctors soon.
0.480000	There have been many times over the past several years that I've gone to doctors with medical complaints, probably all coming from the same source, and left their care with no real effective plan of treatment, and limited insight about what precisely is going wrong with my health, and this applies to primary care physicians, and specialists, and ER doctors. It seems pretty clear that either they can't treat whatever is wrong with me, or just don't care.
1.000000	Because I've been seeing him for years now and he's a very honest doctor who treats you more like a friend he truly cares about rather than just another patient. He sincerely cares about me, my health and my needs and does all he can to help make me feel calm and safe and also optimistic about whatever health issue I'm facing. I've had zero issues with him over the years and despite being terrified of going to the doctor and hopsitals, I still have trust in him because he's never done me wrong. He looks out for my best interests and is one of the best, in my opinion. 
0.920000	I trust her because she seems to really care about me and really listens to what I have to say. She doesn't dismiss what I have to say, big or small.  Nothing I talk to her about feels silly to talk or ask her about 
0.800000	One of the reasons I distrust a lot of Physicians is because in this day, I fear, mostly they are after money. So more test's, more this, more that, try this try that, I fear its all about the money. I wish it wasn't so. But mostly I feel this way. But not about everyone.
0.600000	I  prefer to research on my own but you in general need to trust primary care physician and believe that he is doing good for you
0.960000	He is a kind, compassionate man who always takes time to explain in detail what should be done and how it will be done. He always takes time to explain everything in detail.
0.640000	I don't know that I actually trust my doctor, but I don't actually distrust her either. I guess I trust her to do what's best until she proves otherwise.
0.920000	He has always been very thorough and attentive as well as honest. He takes his time during my appointments and always follows up with me about my test results.
0.760000	My primary is very knowledgeable and listens to what my concerns are, I feel very comfortable trusting him.
0.800000	my doctor takes a lot of time with me we talk he lets me tell him what i think and if i say i don't like something or i am feeling bad about something we talk until we can come together on a fix and he tells just what's up not what i might want to hear
0.760000	I go to a DO rather than an MD. I think she looks at my health more holistically than a regular MD who looks for what they can prescribe to fix the problem. She asks about other things that may be impacting the issue rather than just writing an Rx.
0.600000	I feel that my body usually works itself out in the long run so I am hesitant to most medicines prescribed to me
0.800000	I've been going to the same primary care physician for about 20 years. He knows my medical history and has given me sound advice during that time. It is a relationship built on trust.
0.400000	Doctors in general prescribe generalized medications with no intention of correcting an issue but merely masking the effects
0.440000	I was misdiagnosed with a condition for years and doctors refused to test for it. I have encountered many doctors and some understand more than others.
0.760000	I trust my doctors because they went to medical school and I did not. So I believe them over myself.
0.840000	I don't believe a poor doctor would remain in business for very long.  I regularly check reviews on doctors before I use them.
0.560000	My primary care physicians does her best, but is still just one woman. She does tend to rush, and if what she recommended could drastically alter something going on in my life, I would prefer a second opinion. OR at least a long talk about why she believes this instance/course of action to be the case. People make mistakes, I wouldn't want to be hurt by such an accident.
0.520000	I just feel like they're more worried about how what they can do might impact their career than really paying attention to what's going on
0.720000	I don't put total trust in any man, but for the most part I have a good relationship with my doctor and have been open with her.  We discuss treatments together and i can bring to her new treatments to discuss and together we decide. 
0.760000	He seems to care about me and my needs. They know more Tha. I do and can come up with reasonable solutions.
0.840000	In regards to Doctors in general, based on my families experience, they were very reliable.They benefited (my family) On the judgement of the Physicisn
1.000000	I have been with my physician almost my entire life.  He has on more than one occasion diagnosed me with something that the hospital did not.  Everyone in my town looks up to this man as a talented diagnostician.  If I need a note, he never objects, he always helps me out of things if I need it.  I even have his cell phone if there is an emergency, and he has neglected to charge me a few times when I have been going through financial hardships.  He cares deeply about all his patients and it really shows.
0.560000	I try to ask questions to get the best information, but am not always sure that I have done so. My primary care physician and doctors in general tend to rush appointments and have subordinates reply to me with answers that are sometimes inadequate. My trust is therefore about 50-50.
0.600000	J like to make sure that way my medical care is safe. I want to make sure I get the best health care
0.240000	I don't trust them. They've screwed up before.
0.840000	My doctor is very forth coming with information and explains my options so I can make the best decision.
0.960000	I like my doctor. He is very intelligent and I have been going to him for years. 
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician as she seems dedicated to providing good care and she is well educated. She does however rush through patient visits and many times downplays my concerns or refers me to other people for the answers I need such as nurses or the pharmacy.    
0.840000	I've been going to my primary physician for years, he's always tried to help me to the best of his ability.
1.000000	I completely trust my doctor. He takes the time to actually sit and listen to my concerns and thoroughly answers every question I have.  He is a doctor, and educator, a mentor and friend. 
0.920000	He takes the time to listen to me.  I am comfortable talking to him and he answers any questions in a senseable way. He also suggests more economical a alternative options instead of just drugs. 
0.400000	"It seems like doctors are more interested in seeing as many patients as they can in a day than taking time to really think about what a patient is telling them. It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor who didn't seem rushed and eager to hurry up and go on to the next patient. I think because of this they are quick to farm us out to specialists for things that primary care doctors used to be able to take care of in their own offices, and to make snap judgements about a person's condition rather than take the time to think about what else could be wrong. More and more of them will even tell you whatever is wrong is ""stress"" or that they can't find anything wrong with you, but later if you see another doctor they DO find something legitimately wrong."
0.560000	I have only had my PCP for  a short time so we are still in the trust building stage - more to be determined after further diagnosis and treatments.
0.960000	Have had same dr for 8 years and has always looked out for my best interest and has made sure the I get the medications that I need
0.760000	Because he can attend all the patient it would be very good and nice of it.Great so we can trust physician and it will be very good
0.640000	I generally try to trust doctors, unless I feel like I am being rushed through or not listened to.  I feel most doctors have keeping me healthy as their top priority.
0.760000	Sometimes I feel my clinical doctors are overwhelmed with too many patients and just skim the chart of the patient before him. His skimming the page can hardly relay too much confidence on said patient. 
0.720000	It's a matter of information that is given. If you get multiple opinions and it's the same diagnosis, then it is right, but if there is disagreements then something is amiss
0.760000	I don't have any reason not to trust them. I haven't had any issues come up because I've trusted and taken their advice in the past. I don't think they would tell me false information.
0.840000	I have been with the same doctor through every health issue and this doctor has always listened and understood everything along the way. I could talk to him about anything.
0.920000	I tend to trust my Dr and their opinions because I have disclosed all the symptoms that I have been experiencing therefor I believe they can accurately provide me with a diagnosis.  I also believe that my Dr is also looking out for my best interest.
0.600000	I've had quite a few bad experiences with doctors, so I don't have much confidence in them. Plus lack of health insurance prevents me from having a primary care physician
0.960000	My doctor has always been kind to me. She answers all my questions and listens to my concerns. She gives me different options and helps me decide which is best for me.
1.000000	My doctor talks to me more than he examines me and looks at test results.  He explains absolutely everything; even with pictures when I don't understand.  He insists that any problems I experience are related to my lifestyle.  He keeps  me on a low fat diet, limited alcohol, and a regular sleep schedule.  The only medication he gives me is for my eczema and sleeping pills that I should only take occasionally.  I'm instructed to return to him if I need to take the sleeping pills more than occasionally.  He gave me a nighttime routine that should help me get to sleep.  Long conversations and reviewing my blood pressure history, he discovered that my blood pressure is up only when I don't get enough sleep; so rather than blood pressure medication he wants me to get enough sleep.  
0.720000	I trust my doctors because they are specifically educated in anatomy and should know the human body and be able to diagnose any ailments.
0.600000	in most cases my doctor has my best interest in mind, but there are times I think she group  all of her patient all together instead of going indept
0.520000	Well most of the doctors I've gone to in the last 20 years work at production mills. Get the patients in, give them some drugs, get them out. Treat as many people as possible in the given time.
0.800000	They are trained professionals.  Why would I not trust them?  It's their job to tell me good and bad news.
0.920000	My doctor came back to clinic. Shes the best, you don't feel rushed at all ever.  Se tajes her time and g I es through everything
0.680000	I trust my physician to a fault; she let's me know what I need to do, but sometimes I feel like she doesn't really get me; on the other hand, whenever I need a referral or a document that has to be sent somewhere, she never hesitates to make it happen.
0.640000	I do trust them, but I want to be informed as it is my body, and I want to agree with everything that is done to it, or put a stop if I am not. 
0.960000	My Dr. and I converse quite easily and neither of us is shy nor adverse to talking about my health and habits whether good or bad.
0.800000	i trust him because when i have been to the doctor he has diagnosed my condition and treated it effectively with a few exceptions.  I don't like to go to the doctor though and if i can still function with my illness i will try to ignore it until it goes away.
0.800000	I have been with him for many years. I have done just about everything suggested and I am in pretty good health
0.840000	They are here to help people no matter what is going on with them. They are there to listen. Doctors are there to treat you no matter what
0.760000	I do not have a family care physician. However I will trust him or her based on gut instinct and research
0.720000	I trust my doctor before I do it is good to trust your doctor because they are your doctor and t is good
0.960000	I trust my primary care doctor because he is patient with me, listens to all I have to say and consults with me regarding his decisions.  He has very well trained office staff that provide excellent services.
0.920000	My doctor wants to know about my activities and life so she can better address my medical problems not just the lab work
0.560000	Generally speaking, doctors assume and like to blanket treat everything. If you have really good insurance,  they will order unnecessary labs. Even if those same labs were recently completed and are unlikely to have changed. 
1.000000	Dr give me all the options, and usually the one that would be best for the problem. Also if I need to see a specialist for a problem he make sure tha I seen by the best for my problem. 
0.680000	I have gone to the same doctor since I was eighteen years old. I know his family very well, and he knows mine. He is not the best doctor, but he is my doctor; and I am very satisfied with the care he has given me over the years.
0.760000	I have developed a great deal of trust in him over the many years I have been seeing him. My father recommended my doctor and because my father is a physician , that made me trust him right away. 
0.560000	I feel like my doctor is quick to recommend pharmaceutical drugs for everything I have and go through. I don't like this approach, I like to do things naturally so when he suggests things, I lose a little trust. I also feel like this is generally all doctors. I think they get kickbacks for the medications they prescribe, so it makes me much less trusting of their motives.
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because they tend to know better than I do what is better for me when it comes to my health
1.000000	I trust my doctor because she takes her time in explaining things to me and giving me advice. She is NEVER in a rush, even though there are probably other patients waiting for her. She never hesitates to tell me to call her or her office -- or through the patient portal -- with any questions or concerns that I might have. 
0.680000	I have never had any experience to make me not trust my doctor. Most of the time I think he is trying to do what is best to treat whatever is the wrong in the most effective way.
0.760000	For the most part I trust him but there are times when he seems to give me contradictory information from visit to visit and that makes me nervous. For example, one time my cholesterol will be borderline high and he'll mention it as something I need to work on then next time it will be extremely high and he won't say anything.
0.480000	In regard's to doctor's in general, I have a lack of trust of doctor's for the reason that I have had multiple friend's and loved one's die from cancer. Cancer is a business in this country and patient's with cancer are not told the complete truth when it comes to treating cancer.
0.640000	Sometimes I feel like doctors are so pressed for time they are just trying to get out of the room. Also, I worry about their relationships to insurance and drug companies that might influence their course of treatment. I don't think they wish to do harm, they are just conflicted.
0.480000	Because a doctor can tell you that have one diagnosis and it be the total opposite to what you really have. Fix the symptoms not the diagnosis
1.000000	I trust my Doctor because he take the time to break down all the things I need to do to maintain my health fairly well considering all my illnesses. 
0.560000	Just started going somewhere new and haven't really been that impressed.  They seem to rush through and don't explain things in as much detail as i would prefer. 
0.600000	I JUST SAID NEUTRAL THAT DOESN'T MEAN  NOTHING.I DO TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. I DO HAVE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR
0.320000	I feel as if there is too much for a physician to gain by their own self interests, they have medications that they feel are important to push on people with the side effects and all that considered they often over look the most simplistic things like change of nutrition, or even considering the factors of the patients life.
0.440000	Sometimes doctors assume I don't do or don't know (fill in blank) or they think of me in terms of a stereotypical type of person who is my age and gender. I like to know just about all the details and even the recent research done on whatever is bothering me, so it's lucky I don't have a condition. I trust myself more than a doctor, in general. They can't know more about me than I do.   
0.920000	Same MD I've been seeing for 20 years, I feel she's very open & honest about everything.  She always offers a few different treatment options, and tells me why or why not she would recommend something.
0.840000	My doctor is an exception to the rule; she is interested in what I have to say and the questions I ask and is in no hurry to rush me out.  She leaves when I signal that I am satisfied with my visit.
0.800000	I pick doctors that really care about good outcomes and satisfied patients. Also, if a doctor gives the hint that he/she isn't doing the right thing I will question and leave if necessary.
0.840000	My doctor takes her time, appears to listen, and seems compassionate. She provides her advise and encourages me to consider additional options that could help me be healthier. 
1.000000	When I first went to him, I was leaving a Dr that did not take my problems seriously. This Dr. listened, without interruption, to what was happening, asked many questions. He knew exactly what needed to be done to find and fix the problem. He never rushes his patients and always listens to what you're saying.
0.720000	I trust my doctor. He has been caring for me and my family for years and we have been in good health. he has always provided the correct recommendations and we have trust in him
0.600000	In regards to doctors I feel like they can be trusted for the most part. They have a lot riding on being perfect in their profession. They can lose their jobs and whole practices if they don't perform. I think they can mainly be trusted because of this.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because if I didn't, then who else would I go to. In general, to me, it is very important to trust in the people who take of you, especially doctors who have done their job for a very long time. I trust mine because I know she has the best interest of my health and in helping me out when I need it.
0.720000	She's helpful she's. Very very understanding  Worthy Shea's also very encouraging livening care and kind women 
0.760000	I trust my physician due to the fact of being a paitent of his nurse for a number of years in the past
0.480000	I would like to say I trust doctors but I seldom see one.  I do have medical appointments but I seldom see a full-fledged doctor.  I dislike having my rare times in medical offices be with a nurse practitioner, etc.
0.840000	I have know my primary care physician for 15 years and have never had an issue with how she or her staff have treated me. She is also my wife's primary care dotor.
1.000000	I generally don't have any complex conditions and usually only receive preventative screenings. However, when I was pregnant and seeing a doctor on a regular basis, I do believe she had the depth of experience regarding my condition and trusted that she would provide great care for me. I followed her advice and believe my pregnancy had no issues because of her care.
1.000000	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because he really looks out for my well being he understands that I have a 6 year old and he wants me to be around until she is grown.
0.440000	It's not necessarily that I don't trust my doctor but  I think she's far too rushed for such a serious matter. She is very casual and nonchalant about things that are of great importance to my life. She brushes off side effects/symptoms as if they are normal every day things but then puts me on medication to alter them and brings up having to have heart surgery. I am getting mixed messages and it makes me unsure of the severity or what she is thinking about course of treatment.
0.600000	I'm not entirely happy with my primary care physician because he doesn't always take the time I would like him to take with me.  It is a busy practice. I am currently looking for a new doctor who will be willing to spend time answering my questions.  A doctor who will listen to me and not just assume I don't know what i'm talking about when it comes to my health.
0.960000	I have known my doctor for years and he has always been good to me. I haven't ever had a reason to stop trusting him.
0.720000	They are sometimes in a hurry. They don't always have all the answers. I value  second opinions or even thirds.
0.720000	I trust my care physician to gather the information he needs to make an informed decision. I trust them to be honest in their assessments and recommendations.  That said I don't always trust that they are giving me every reasoble option and sometimes feel I need to prod for altertives (real Western medicine altertives, not to be confused with altertive-medicine).  Sometimes with prescription recommendations I get concerned over whether I can trust my care physician due shady pharma-reps.
0.600000	I have a very good connection with my healthcare provider. I trust him very much. i am not worried at all.
0.760000	A primary care physician (PCP), or primary care provider, is a health care professional who practices general medicine. PCPs are our first stop for medical care. Most PCPs are doctors, but nurse practitioners and even physician assistants can sometimes also be PCPs.
0.960000	i trust my primary care physician because they are very competent and i am pleased with them. very good prescriptions and affordable health care for me and my family. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because he is a persol friend and he was y friend before he became my doctor. He knows me very well.
0.760000	This doctor now I have is new; so I don't know very well but my last primary care doctor; who just recently retired, always sat down with me and explained the pros and cons of each action he wanted me to take or not take.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I see him every day at work, and we have a friendship outside of work. If you can't trust someone at happy hour, then where can you trust him? Especially when it comes to doctors. 
0.600000	For myself, I go to Planned Parenthood for all my medical needs, so the person who sees me for my medical needs always changes; I never know who I will get. Some practitioners seem quite trusting, while other can't wait to end their day. I think most give good advice, but I always like to double check when it's something very, very important.
0.800000	My doctor spends quite a bit of time per appointment assessing my needs through discussion.  Generally, appointments take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour due to conversation and examination.  He is very good about about collecting and assessing information from visit to visit because he keeps great notes.
0.960000	My PCP is a most thorough doctor who cares about me as a patient. He extends his profession so that I get optimum care.
0.600000	It's hard to understand and get the right answer we should try to get all the information as possible 
0.600000	I kind of trust them because they are semi honest with me but really don't tell about my condition or if I might have a certain condition and they can be kind of rude and not motivating at all 
0.480000	My primary care doctor works for the Dept Of Veterans Affairs, I truly believe he has the best interest of the VA not me.
1.000000	"My doctor has spent time during my visits to listen to everything I say. He listens to me like a therapist. He will even call me from his cell phone after business hours to discuss test results as he gets them. He's always been very thorough in explaining medical conditions and terms and treatments. He always ""fixes"" me quickly."
0.720000	i trust my doctor because he always correctly diagnoses me. He expresses to me the benefits and risks when starting new medications.
1.000000	Because I routinely ask probing questions about their opinions, medications, and treatment options. I rarely make up my mind about a Physician until I seen then on multiple occasions. Occasionally, I research their background and consult other physicians about their reputations.
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician because when I told him about my coughing and inability to breathe, he actually took me seriously, unlike the previous three. Now I have two inhalers (maintenance steroid and emergency albuterol) that help me breathe better. That's all I want from a doctor: mutual respect enough to take me seriously when I say something is a problem. (And he doesn't pathologize my sexuality, which also helps.)
0.600000	My doctor seems very stern and I am uncertain whether she truly knows what is best for my body. For instance, she strongly recommended that I take birth control. However, I am not open to the effects that it will have on my body and at this point and time in my relationship, a child would not be such a bad thing. She did not care for my feelings and was only concerned about the medical aspect of the situation. 
0.520000	My doctor is opened minded, listens, cares about my overall well being and want whats best for my health.
0.760000	I feel as though she listens to me and takes the time needed for my care. I do not feel rushed when I am see my Physician.
0.800000	She has always explained things to my satisfaction, both medically and with regard to insurance.  She has helped me and noticed other issues that I didn't really pay attention to, which I really appreciate.  She works hard to help me in any way.
0.560000	I had to switch plans and have no history with this doctor. His entire knowledge of me is post traumatic times. He doesn't know when I was healthy enogh to do normal things but i look perfectly fine. I describe chronic issues that I think he considers whiny or malingering. He is only my doctor because I can access his location the easiest. He seems to be a doctor who prefers wealthy clients. That being said he did I.D. one condition that others had missed or advocated wild treatments for. That is the basis of the level of trust I DO have in him.
0.800000	I don't have any specific reason why I trust or distrust my primary doctor because I'd never had any reasons at all. I'd never had any doubts about my doctor. 
0.840000	I DO NOT KNOW IF MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTEREST AT HEART. I AM NEW TO HIS PRACTICE AND HAVE NOT FULLY MADE UP MY MIND ON HIM. 
0.960000	I have been using the same doctor for over 20 years and have experienced a range of issues in which he has guided me well and with great empathy and no judgment. I have had no reason to question his judgment as he has been very wise and when he has insufficient knowledge, has directed me to people who have uniformly been knowledgable. We know each other well and have a great history.
1.000000	I trust him very much because when I needed help with something he referred me in the right direction. That next experience was a healthy and good experience for me that has made me healthier.
0.760000	I am not smart enough to not trust my doctor completely. I don't go to the doctor that often, but when I do I take them at face value. They have never steered me wrong when I have needed them in the past.
0.800000	She's kind but straight forward and tells me how it is. She listens to my thoughts and concerns. She's never given me a reason to not trust her.
0.960000	She's personable and tells me of different ways to handle any diagnosis that she gives me: sinuses, etc.
0.800000	I trust my psychiatrist because I've been seeing him for years. This is someone who has seen me at my absolute worst, and has watched me pick myself up and turn my life around. I trust him because he never makes me feel judged or like I'm just another patient that needs to get in and out of his office. 
0.480000	"I don't feel as though a personal relationship of any sort has been established over time and his ""bedside manner"" is curt and distant. I sometimes feel as though I am just another task of the day to get over with as quickly as possible. I do think I need special attention, but become discouraged with I feel that our time is rushed or treated as entirely insignificant. "
0.960000	I trust my Doctor because I know he has his patients (myself included) best interest at heart.  If I have questions he always will explain his answers in a way where I will understand.
0.720000	I trust my primary physician to do her best but no one is perfect and everyone has flaws, so I don't completely trust her because she can make a mistake due to human error.
0.440000	I have experienced negative doctor outcomes with members of my family, including my husband, Mother and Father. I therefore question everyhing when it comes to dealing with doctors. 
0.560000	Majority doctors are trustworthy but i feel that some can't be bothered much. Just looking for there persol benefits. 
0.880000	I have a very high level of trust for my primary care physician. I have been seeing him off and on for over a decade now, and he has never been anything but polite, helpful, and understanding. Every time I have an appointment with him he makes sure all of my needs are met and that all of my questions are answered right there. I am very satisfied.
0.800000	My doctor listens to me and thinks about what to do often if he can not figure things out he will send me to a specialist.
0.360000	I don't have a primary care physician at the moment, but if/when I get one, I'll judge him based on his expertise, reputation, my own knowledge and judgment and first impressions.
0.640000	I am not the type of person that ever completely trust someone. Doctors are humans as well. They view things with the common eye and have to give prognosis. There are a lot of conditions that exist so I will always second guess what I'm being told.
0.800000	She spends the time necessary to make sure I understand everything we talk about and about treatment options.  She herself always calls me with test results and asks if I have any questions.  She never makes me feel rushed. 
0.960000	I often go back and research what my doctor has told me. I use the internet to find out...he has always been right and makes the best decisions for my health
0.720000	My Doctor is very thorough and I trust his recommendations for treatments or prescriptions. However, I always do my own research and have refused drugs based on public evidence of problems.
0.800000	I trust physicians including mine. I do not think doctors are out to hurt us. I do not think it is likely to have a doctor make a horrible mistake so it is probably best for my health to trust in them. 
0.480000	I feel that the majority of doctors have taken a general approach to caring for patients. I think they are forced to see so many patients an hour that if you complain about a typical set of things then they prescribe or recommend x based solely off that.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because we communicate effectively with each other. If we don't communicate what is going on or on all the different treatments available than I would not have as much trust as I do today.
0.760000	I think my doctor cares about what is wrong with me but i feel he is to busy to listen one hundred percent. He is at a clinc for low income people
1.000000	I trust my doctor because is a doctor that really cares about is patients. He takes the time to really talk and explain everything to me.
0.800000	For the most part I trust my doctor (who is actually a PA).  I can see in his eyes and actions that he really is reading my material and really does want to help.  It is my responsibility to make sure anything he says applies to me but for the most part I go along with what he says because of the time and care he puts into his words.
0.520000	"I ""trust"" doctors in general, as in, I believe they are highly educated and that this education is important for being able to evaluate complex information and make health-related decisions. I also think most doctors are conscientious about their work with their patients and sincerely care about their well-being, even if they are subject to regular human biases. Personally, though, I hate going to doctors and actively avoid them, because I am an extremely private person and don't want to share personal and sensitive information about myself, or to be physically examined. For this reason, and because I am generally well-educated myself, I strongly prefer to avoid doctors and make personal health decisions on my own whenever possible."
0.880000	Same doctor for 7 years so good rapport. Doctor keeps up on the latest studies and medications for my health concerns
1.000000	I trust the doctor because I have a hunch about whether or or not she's giving me the right referral to to get a great or whatever. I sense she's ashtrays telling me the right things
0.840000	I usually have been healthy so my doctor visits are really short but If there is a problem my doctor is right on top of it and either gets me help or helps me right away by getting me an appointment with the appropriate physician.
1.000000	I trust my physician bevause they have been my physician for at least 3 years. She has never steered me in the wrong direction and I am going to trust every decision that she makes as far as my well being is concerned.
0.880000	"I trust my medical professional because from the moment I met her, she engaged me and made me feel comfortable and relaxed.  Throughout my visits with her, I've seen her competency shine through and appreciate her honesty and her ""house tricks"" to treat more common/household illnesses.  While she may prescribe a medication, she'll also talk through other alternatives and recommendations."
0.800000	I trust them all no matter what the situation, sometimes I do get other opinion on something just to make sure.
0.800000	My doctor treat me like a person. My doctor talks to me not at me. He takes time to answer any questions i have.
0.760000	he/she has an attiitude of condesension when it comes to questioning the doctor patient partnership that exists and the extent to which you as a patient are able to provide valuable input 
0.560000	Although I may respect and trust my doctor's opinion, I also have into account the limited amount of time he has with me, and the fact that I am an individual and not everything will work the same for everyone. While he has the ability to be medically informed, I know my own body and sometimes doctor fail to listen to their patients. I make independent inquiries and do my own research about medications prescribed and won't hesitate to stop taking a medication that is giving me undesirable effects/reactions.
0.800000	My Primary care physician works with a team. I feel confident that he can handle any medical situation I might have, he also consults with the team if necessary.
0.800000	I've known my primary care doctor for years and he is very good. He is better than many of the other doctors that I'm around especially the VA.

0.920000	I think there are so many laws now that the doctors and my doctor are very thorough and honest. It also helps he is very kind and respectable. 
0.960000	I trust that my doctor will provide the best care and be at the best interest of the patient. I also will research and make sure I completely agree with treatment options. 
0.760000	My doctor is a good listener and answers the questions that concern me.  She does not rush my appointments and is willing to go beyond my timeframe to allow the questions to be addressed.
0.800000	he is always friendly, upfront about anything I ask him. He always gives me an honest opinion about medications and leaves it up to me if I should take them or not.
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he is very knowledgeable and caring about my general health. And he is friendly always willing to go the extra mile.
0.640000	I generally trust my primary care physician yet I realize that any final decisions about my health (including treatments, medicines, etc.) are my choice to make.  Doctors are there to help the patients, give them advice, and so forth.  It is up to the patient to also rely on him or herself for health care.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because he is a professional. He always treats me with care and respect. I never feel like I'm getting bogus or insufficient information. He's also pretty good at remembering things I've told him in the past--personally, I mean. 
0.760000	I trust those medical people that I'm close to. They believe that their approach is correct, and I respect this. However, I sometimes have my own views,.. often, in fact. However, as stated, my trust is generally high.
0.760000	I do not have a primary care physician that I see regularly so it is hard to say. I based my answers on the times that I have seen doctors in the past. In general I think that doctors are trustworthy and do have the best interests of their patients at heart.
0.400000	My primary care physician is not interested in my care.  He just wants me in and out so he can get to the next patient or have sometime off in between patients.  He only ever tells me one option even if I ask for another option he will just tell me the first option was better.
0.800000	I have a military doctor, and I always think that being in the military, you can't always mess up things and you always think about the servicemember, and not your own self or convenience.
0.560000	"My primary care doctor's response to my medical problems is usually ""Well, You're getting older"".  Not helpful"
0.960000	"Just saw my PA yesterday. Here's what I wrote in the survey sent by the hospital. ""Kandace has literally saved my life. I had an onset of PMDD and was suicidal. Her triage nurse, ncy, took my concerns seriously and got me in within 2 hours. I had untreated lifelong anxiety disorder and had been on five different benzos. Kandace put me on Zoloft and I had peace of mind for the first time in FIFTY years. I had debilitating sinus migraines and she put on Allegra and I haven't had one since. She diagnosed hypothyroidism when I came in bundled up for Antarctica. She has controlled my HBP. She diagnosed a Vitamin D3 deficiency confirmed by blood test. She is simply the best primary care provider I have ever had in my 66 years."""
0.920000	I love my doctor because he is truthful about my health issues. He provide good feedback when I'm feeling sick or having problems
0.680000	"My primary care doctor is fairly new. She has a new practice and I just signed up for treatment. However, she has not given me any reason to distrust her. For the most part, my trust is rated at ""neutral"" because I just don't have enough experience with her."
0.720000	I trust him to a point - he is so busy seeing a lot of patients at any given time I sometimes wonder if he really understands all my problems/ailments. 
0.600000	i would not say i trust her because sometimes for correct diagnosis of the problem a series of examinations are involved eg.scanning and some may not be correct
0.360000	My doctor told me that Ihave osetheoarthritis but Ihave rheumetoid arthritis.  Two doctors that tested me told me this.  My doctor has a scolding type of personality.  She isn't friendly.  Idon't feel comfortable around her.  Iavoid her and go to a separate clinic or straight to the hospital if I need care- such as when I just broke my shoulder.
0.800000	I've gone to my PCP since I was a child, we have a really good relationship. 
0.600000	I don't have one yet still in the process of finding one and hope to get one very soon because health is important
0.640000	I have been with my current primary care doctor for over a year and he is very trustworthy. He explains diagnoses and treatment options in simple easy to understand language i understand. 
1.000000	She is very smart about what is new .When ever I call emergency, she takes me on . She never knocks me down .Explains every thing an never rushes me out !!! 
0.680000	They seem to care about the patient's well being rather than their financial benefit. Often times, some are willing to discuss concerns outside business hours.
0.520000	i know that doctors are experts, but they are often wrong about things. sometimes they dont listen to what the patient is really telling them.
0.600000	My distrust in my primary care DR is when they told me inserts in my meds was for lawyers and not for me to read, That was not right
0.600000	I do not have a primary physician, however I rely on my sister, who is a physician, for all things medical. I don't always follow her advice, but I do listen and ask the appropriate questions before making my own decisions. However, I know many, many doctors and don't trust a great deal of them to have the patient's best interest at heart. Sometimes they are lazy. Sometimes they are condescending. Sometimes the amount of money they'll receive from the patient's insurance/pockets matters the most.
0.760000	I trust my Dr because she is very honest with me. She tells me what she thinks is the best situation for me regarding my diabetes. We also talk about family. I know she is married to another Dr, and they have 2 boys. I broke my fibula last year, and she was very honest with me regarding the healing process with my leg. I took about 10 months to heal, and I sometimes still have pain. She told me I will probably have pain on and off for the rest of my life. diabetes and my age are factors in the slow healing.
0.640000	The doctor's experience, Your level of education, Your work experience, Their industrial-level status
0.560000	Doctors are human and as such are not above making mistakes and missing things that should have been observed and so we have to remember this and question things along the way.
0.520000	I have went thru a few primary care physicians in the last 2  years. I've had trouble finding one that wants to listen and help me with my problems. They always seems like they are rude, in a hurry or just push me off on to a specialist. Thats not what I want. 
0.760000	The doctor takes the time to explain, advise and council. Dosent run patients through like cattle, or make you feel rushed
0.960000	My doctor is open and willing to have conversation about my concerns. She listens and then refers me for further study or specialist if she is not certain of the status or route to take.
0.600000	I generally do not completely trust doctors.  I had one that was totally honest and they could not fix the problem. Another could have fixed something and did not.  A lot of times it's medication. not doctors I don't trust.  My mother died from the nthe side effects of a med she was on.
0.200000	Because I've had many surgeries that I didnt have to have. Which has caused me a lifetime of pain. There was other options I found was available after surgeries 
0.680000	I really like my PCP. He listens and relys on my instincts as to what is going on. He is geniuinely nice and appreciative of my time and efforts.
0.480000	I don't have a primary care physician as of now but I need one. I rarely trust them because it's some crazy doctors in the world but I'll trust my own doctor.
0.800000	my doctor is great she will take the time to listen to me when i see her she always is caring and tells me what i need to know about my health
0.600000	Most doctors want to tell you stuff that will keep you coming back to see them. They like to write prescription for you to get.
1.000000	I have had the same primary care doc for over 10 years. He is a faculty physician at the University of Colorado and noted for his research and teaching abilities. He is also extremely kind and attentive.
1.000000	I've been to a lot of other Dr's who seem to ignore the issues I'm having and just focus on my weight. My current Dr does not do that, although we are working on getting my weight down it's not her solo focus.
0.840000	Of course I trust my doctor. What am I supposed to do otherwise? He or she has the education and experience to be able to best help me.
0.440000	All doctors want is money. Long ago has patent care went away and all people want in the medical field is just money 
0.600000	I mostly trust but I also know that doctors do not know everything and they make mistakes too. I also have heard many stories of people having doctors who push their own agendas or make decisions based on what is easiest and safest for them and I worry about that happening to me. 
0.720000	It's not that I don't trust them it's they always seem to have altertive agendas then what you feel you need. You go in for one thing and they test you for eight other things, they find out what's wrong and then they experiment with different medicines. 
0.440000	Doctors are influenced by the number they can put on your bill.  If it costs more they'll recommend it.  Also pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to push their drugs over something that may be more appropriate for my condition.
0.880000	My doctor has been working in the field for a long time, so I trust her. I can also tell from her tone of voice that she really cares about the welfare of her patients, so I can trust her 100%. 
0.840000	My primary care physician actually listens to me, takes the time to hear and understand my concerns, and is willing to explore alterte treatment options er provide referrals to other specialists if we agree there may be some benefit.
0.920000	I've never had a reason to doubt a doctor when I've seen one. Every meeting I've had with a doctor has always gone well. The doctor has always given me a sense of confidence in their decisions.
0.560000	I trust the PA more then my primary doctor, she is more willing to find out what is wrong with me. Some primary doctors are only in it for the money and are not willing to diagnose and find out what is wrong with their patients. If a test doesn't show what is wrong then it ends there
0.720000	Most doctors are trustworthy, their time is so valuable that they tend to cut to the chase and give only a few minutes and rarely find out how you really are doing.
0.480000	he is under a lot of pressure to see a lot of patients. he is always in a hurry and the medical record he refers to doesn't always seem complete for me, like what was covered in the last appointment. 
0.600000	Right at the moment I don't have a primary care physician.  I am currently searching for one.  I had one and he changed hospitals.
1.000000	He has my interest and always keeps me aware of my health and what I should be aware of as I grow older. The things we must do to keep me healthy
0.600000	It is not that I distrust my primary care doctor but that I am fully aware they are human and humans make mistakes and or tend to miss things that aren't obvious so I am a strong advocate in believing in my gut and getting a second opinion if I have any doubts 
0.680000	she is more than willing to answer any questions, and seems like she knows her stuff, thought I feel like she could care more for me, spending more time when I visit.
0.880000	I had the same doctor for the last 12 years. He has always taken good care of me. I think of him more like a family friend than just my primary care doctor. When I had lower back pain problem and couldn't sleep, he referred me to a really good chiropractor and physical therapist. I put a lot of trust in his diagnostic and advice because he is almost always correct with his assessment.   
0.920000	I have always felt my doctor has been totally open and honest with me.  I have never felt rushed.  I feel like I can tell her anything and will get an truthful answer back.
0.560000	I have a friend who highly distrusts most doctors due to her extensive experience with them, and I trust her judgements about things. However, I have seen nothing strange from my own doctor. 
0.600000	I feel like all they want to do is make the most money they can so they refer things for no reasons like procedures and medicine
0.840000	I trust my physician because he is honest and upfront with information regarding my health. I can count on my doctor to be honest no matter what
0.800000	I have had the same primary care physician for over twenty years. He has shown that he intends nothing but the best over the years. I've been able to see his professiolism and he even keeps extra tabs on me to see if I am doing well.
0.920000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very trustworthy and honest with the information that deals with my  health. She always lets me know what's  harmful to me and whats not.
0.520000	I appreciate everything that physicians do for their patients, although I sometimes feel as though certain doctors are motivated to perform a particular action because of personal financial gain. That, or sometimes certain doctors do not show a great sense of genuine interest towards their patients.
0.880000	Listen to my questions by verbal or notes and they give me eye contact not ignore me and also give me advice of things to try out before the next step and have me at times look up information on line if I don't understand what they are talking about
0.760000	I trust the dctrs they trust and respect my decisions. Reputation is key not there money i have dctrs that think that way
0.960000	My primary care physician has been for the most part right on the money in making diagnoses. I trust my doctor with injections and diagnostic tests which have never caused me any harm.
0.800000	our doctor is well known in my community and he is our family doctor. my mom trust him, so i trust him too. but talking to other doctors, i test them first by asking a lot of questions before i can trust them
0.600000	I rely on my doctor to select what s/he thinks are the three best treatment options for me based on what s/he knows about me.  However, I expect her/him to review the pros and cons of each option, entertain my question/s and then let me pick the treatment that I think is best for me.  If my medical professional can not help me navigate that process then I do not trust him/her and would look for a new PCP.
0.600000	I generally trust my doctor, but I feel like I see them only occasionally and not for that long, so although I trust their diagnoses and treatment recommendations, I also think I would seek out further information about it so that I could consider how much I think it is good.
0.640000	most of the time i agree that they are trustworthy, but i can think of times they just want to prescribe something and not care too much about other possibilities 
0.720000	My doctor takes time to listen and try to explain things to me.  She seems very thorough in here assessment of my situations and has not steered me wrong yet in health decisions.
0.720000	I would trust my primary car physician because it is a doctor that you regularly see and they know you and your health. they will know if something is wrong.
0.520000	"Medicine is now practiced by rote. The ""average"" person will accept the off-the-cuff surface diagnosis.  I'm not one of those people. As my mother pointed out years ago, presidents, kings, and doctors, all put their pants on one leg at a time. I only accept the ""Gospel truth"" from the Gospel."
1.000000	I do trust my doctor.  He is very kind and thoughtful.  If I do not want to have an x-ray done, he does not force me to have it done.  He always asks me how I am feeling and if I have any questions and concerns that he can help me with.
0.720000	My PCP is thorough and detail-oriented, but I also feel like he dismisses what he sees as minor issues too easily. He's also quick to send me elsewhere to a specialist if anything even remotely complex comes up.
0.560000	I trust doctors for the most part because they have dedicated their lives to helping others. Because of this, I assume that they have my best interests in mind, especially when it comes to my personal health. 
0.920000	I have been going to the same pediatric physician since I was 3 years old and have continued since the past 17 years. Since I have been with this doctor all of my personal health risk and issues have been taken care of accordingly.
0.880000	My doctor always tells me their opinion and their level of confidence. They give me options if they are available.
0.920000	I trust them with my care. They know more medical stuff than I do. It would be crazy not to trust them.
0.400000	I donât really trust my doctors completely. They tend to never give me options and just go with what they want me to do. I went in for back pain and I asked to be sent to chiropractor, but she was a firm believer in physical therapy, so denied my request and sent me to physical therapy which didnât help and she still refuses to do what I think is right for my health. 
0.760000	My primary physician is a holistic doctor.  He has pulled me through some really tough situations that conventional medicine could not address.  Yes, I have complete trust in him and in his associates
1.000000	Because they are trained to know what is best for my well being. I trust them completely in evaluating and treating anything that may or not be wrong with me.
0.800000	the doctors  are the best in all areas. the help much peoples in differents topics. the take their time and they change in thing beest
0.760000	I mainly go to the dermatologist so I'll speak on that. She's amazing my skin has progressed tremendously. I trust her because I see the effects of her work. She's told me to do specific thing to help my skin and they have worked, this has helped build the trust between us. 
0.800000	My PCP always ask about my health physically and mentally and is always engaged in my questions and concerns and provides any info that can enhance my health and life in general.  She makes me feel like a person and not another 30 minute slot to fill
0.280000	As of late, my doctor has been pretty dismissive of my health concerns. He is very busy and spends almost no time evaluating me. Because of this, I am currently searching for a new doctor. I feel that he does not take what I have to say seriously. 
0.520000	My trust in my doctor depends on if I feel that he is doing the best for me and not trying to push medical treatments on me for the sake of convenience or experimentation. I want him to take the time to know me and what is best for me.
0.760000	I researched my condition and I was given a treatment plan that included medication and one that included a natural change in my diet. This was the same research that I did prior to consulting with my doctor. Thus, no medication or plan is being forced upon me. Also, I was able to express my discomfort with the medication that I was using and I was switched to a different medication. 
0.720000	I prefer to trust my PCP because they can come up with the diagnosis of what's wrong with me and can prescribe me the right medication or other additional help that I need. They have more experience in their field and should be good at what they do. 
0.840000	I feel like my doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and address them. He doesn't blow off what I say even if it takes us a little while to figure out what is going on.
0.800000	I trust most doctors simply on the fact that I know nothing about it and they are train and educated to know about it. Also, some doctors just seem more genuine in the bedside manner than others.
0.760000	I have had a long relationship with  of my doctors. I can depend on them to answer all my questions and give me their honest opinion 
0.560000	I trust my doctor but then I don't because I don't feel like they are giving me all the help I need at times but then again they do help at least keep me going in life with all my medical problems that I have right now but I feel like there is more they could do to help me so that's why I don't kinda trust them it's like they are just rushing through  patients at time to get over work and not actually looking to really help
0.760000	 I generally have trust in my doctor's motives. I have bad reactions to some prescribed medications but, the doctor was not careless or incorrect in prescribing them for me.  The two bad experiences I had were; a doctor who wanted to do a surgical procedure in office with local anesthesia that, as I found out when I had it done in hospital, would have likely killed me if I had allowed him to proceed, and a doctor who took a phone call while suturing me and allowed a poorly trained nurse to finish the job. Big scar! I have had many more doctors who went the extra mile and saved my life or health through being extra thorough with my diagnosis.
0.640000	In general, I trust what she tells me.  However, she is a general practitioner and I've learned that when I consult with specialists I often get more options and more information.  Therefore, I don't always think what my GP tells me is all I need to know.
0.800000	I trust my doctor.  She never seems to be too busy or distracted to answer my questions.  She is not arrogant some some doctors I have know.  She asks a number of questions about how I am feeling.  She responds very persollybout any medical tests or lab work that I have done.
1.000000	I have never had a doctor recommend anything that was harmful for me. My doctor's have always been sure that i understand everything going on with me. 
0.600000	Some of my specialists are excellent doctors, but others take an approach f get the meeting over with as fast as possible
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he seems very knowledgeable whenever I need to consult him.  He has been the doctor of my mother and grandparents for a number of years and has always done right by them.  I find that when I communicate clearly with him he is easy to understand and is easily able to diagnose my issue.
0.840000	 My primary care physician at this time is very patient and open to explaining things to me in ways I can understand.   She takes the time I need to make sure I am comprehending what she's explaining.   I feel safe asking her anything. 
0.760000	Doctors can  treat on tests and what the patient says. I still trust their opinion to a certain extent.
1.000000	I have built up a great relationship with my doctor.  He allows me to contact him anytime and that makes a very persol relationship. 
0.960000	Very caring doctor. She is non-judgemental.
1.000000	I feel my doctors look out for my best interest.  They listen to me, answer my questions and make me feel confident I am doing the right thing.  I have been fortunate in my selection of physicians
0.600000	I trust my doctor, I just think though she has to see too many patients and does not spend enough time to really understand my problem and provide a diagnoses that is exactly right for my situation; more so just what the average person has and the average response for cure
0.560000	Honestly, I trust doctors to a certain extent as far as diagnosing a problem, but I think their treatment options are generally given according to what makes them the most money. 
0.920000	I have a PCP but I answered these questions regarding my OBGYN because that is the doctor I see most frequently as I have had 2 rough pregnancies over the past few years. I do trust her to take the best care of me. Last spring / summer, she made the decision that I should take progesterone shots beginning at 16 weeks and that I needed to be hospitalized during the second trimester of my pregnancy because of complications. I spent about 2 months there and because of the choices she made regarding my care, I was able to have a healthy baby boy at 35 weeks. She erred on the side of caution because she knew my previous baby had been born suddenly 7 weeks early. Moving forward, if I have any more children I will definitely want to continue under her care because I trust her.
0.520000	I feel that they generally are trying to rush you out of the office and don't really care that much.
0.560000	most doctors like to load their patients up on lots of medications. for example, when i was 17 i went to my doctor with stomach pain. it turns out i have acid reflux, my doctor gave me medication for it instead of giving me a list of foods to avoid.
0.440000	In general, doctors do not spend enough time with patients to get the WHOLE story, and sometimes a little tidbit of information that the patient might not seem to think is pertinent can make a diagnosis or a more appropriate treatment.
0.600000	Well it depends. Some doctors only group their patients in a certain category. They do not praise when the patient does well and cannot recognize the patients who are compliant 
0.840000	My doctor was referred to me by another doctor who spoke extremely highly of him and had nothing but excellent things to say about him.
0.520000	I often feel rushed and that my treatment is according to protocol, not individual needs.  I often have to remind my doctor about other medication, side effects, etc.
0.800000	My primary care physician is very good at listening.  She listens to any input tht I have and we make a plan of action.
0.720000	i trust it but sometimes i feel like they are like a mechanic , they tell you extra things that are wrong than what actually is. medicines are expensive and the doctor scares me
0.840000	I will always trust her because she helps me manage my diabetes so well and she keeps me from ending up in the emergency room by helping me keep my blood sugars under control
0.560000	Being on Medicaid, I don't see Dr's but students who are still learning and sometimes don't know or make mistakes.
0.880000	My physician does a great job of explaining things carefully and thoughtfully. He also believes in getting a second opinion when needed.
0.800000	I trust my doctor for the most part because he has never given me any reason not to. Everytime i do go to my doctor, he usually is very helpful in figuring out whats wrong and solving it. He also never tries to get me to take any medications  that will have bad side effects, and is really compromising in all aspects. 
0.760000	At times, their mane concern is to make money through my insurance or even through me. I would rather look up my illness and take care of it in my only unless it is really savvier, then I would go in and have the doctor take a look. 
0.800000	It took me a while to get to a point where I felt okay with this doctor; my previous doctor died and I switched to the current doctor, who was in the same practice, and we clashed at first. But now we understand each other better. Also, I got treated for my trypanophobia (fear of medical needles) and since then I am better able to trust doctors in general.
1.000000	My doctor is completely honest with me whenever I had an appointment. He tells me exactly what is wrong and the possibles outcomes of it, as well as the aproaches I can take.
0.480000	I feel that most doctors are there to meet their bottom line.  They care more about the money they can make than the people that they see.  
0.840000	I have never had any reason not to trust her. All care I have received has been prompt and efficient and addressed any concerns/issues I had.
0.800000	I don't have much experience interacting with my physician because I'm pretty healthy.
0.760000	I trust my doctor because I've been seeing them for almost 10 years and they're familiar with my health and what works best for my body.  Up to this point, they've always given me accurate information and helped me improve my health in a safe way.
0.360000	Most doctors, including my PCP, make judgments about me based on how I look, not about my self or health in general. I frequently feel like my concerns are dismissed by doctors, or they treat me as if I am uneducated.
0.200000	I do not trust mu primary physician because im afraid he may treat me like an experiment i wish he would better understand me as well 
0.640000	I'm currently looking for a doctor I just moved to my new address and I don't have reliable transportation so it's hard to get around with a lot a car
0.840000	I trust my doctor to know what is right for me because she generally chooses the option that she knows will be covered with insurance and tries to get me the best treatment while also considering my financial situation.
0.800000	She seems to have my best care in mind. Also she has taken care of all my questions with care.  Andshe consults with the other professionals in her network. So she has earned my trust and I hope to continue in her care.
0.880000	She takes time to concentrate on my problems and my needs. She always offers me the best advices and guidelines
0.440000	The medical system now exists to benefit companies and not the people, they look at us like we are machines but we have feelings and concerns that often go unnoticed 
0.680000	"I had an experience where I thought all possible testing was done on an annual basis, and that I had requested and approved.  I later found that that was not the case and I was positive for something that they don't test for ""unless you have symptoms"", even though it was consistently marked as something I wanted to be tested for annually.  Since then I have had no issues, but that was a serious misstep in communication."
1.000000	Doctors knows best. They are to be trusted at all times. Doctors knows the human body and knows what to provide 
0.800000	After a few problems with doctors ignoring my concerns (I spent years with a vitamin deficiency b/c the doc would order bloodwork and insisted it was all in my head) I found an extremely thorough doctor that listens to me. 
0.920000	I have been going to the same primary doctor for decades, have gotten good advice, and good treatment, that whole time, and have built up trust in her opinions.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician, therefore I marked all of the above items as neutral. I've personally been friends with several doctors in my life, and the reality is they are people like everyone else, and as a result my trust in them depends on their ethics and character. Some doctors are very caring and insightful, some are full of ego that blinds them truly looking and understanding a case before them. And all degrees in between. Should I ever need to see a doctor, I will to a great deal of research on them before consenting to be their patient.
0.320000	"My PCP is worthless. i have been going there for 5 years, sick as a dog, and he keeps telling me I am ""healthy as a horse"" on paper. Just great.  I am in the process of finding another doctor before i croak."
1.000000	I have a lot of trust in my doctors. Case and point was last year when I wanted to change my birth control. I was on the pill and wanted to have the implant in my arm. My doctor came in before and went over all the other types of birth control and all the benefits and side effects to all of them. Once we got through that and I still wanted the implant she proceeded. While she was putting the implant in I asked her why she asked all those questions even though I scheduled the implant. She said she felt people didn't look at all the information that is out there and sometimes people don't know all the different options they have. She wanted me to know and understand all my options before going forward so I made the best decision for myself. 
0.520000	Im in the middle.  I trust him because he is a physician and he tries to make my health better.  In a way i dont trust him because he doesnt give me more alternatives to make my health better
0.840000	my doctor is very good  she is very thorough  and asks me a lot of questions  i like her very much  she always takes a good amount of time with me 
0.400000	Like I stated in the earlier essay question, in my experience with health care professionals (doctor's moreso than nurses), they tend to either ignore or downplay my questions and concerns. This angers me because I'm intelligent and I am great at researching, so I believe that my questions and concerns are well-founded and based on facts.
0.880000	I trust my physician because they never rush me. I trust my physician because they always take time to explain complicated diagnoses or procedures to me. I trust my physician because they always smile whenever we interact. I trust my physician because they are great with going the extra mile to make sure I confident in my healthcare decisions by making sure I fully understand and risks associated.
0.720000	Im not soley untrustworthy of doctors however mesicine in my opinion has stiffled the body from self healing medicinal alternatives also doctors are worry about money more than patient and thats a concern of mines
0.520000	In general i trust my physician. It's not because I don't trust her that I don't tell her everything, it's because I worry about her thinking I'm being silly and a waste of time.
0.600000	I have the utmost trust in the group of  nurse midwives that I see for my primary gynecological care and for the birth of my son.  I believe their values perfectly align with my own and I trust them implicitly with medical decisions.  I trust most doctors less.
0.960000	I really do trust my physician because of his bedside manner, his eye contact, his willingness to answer questions, the way he makes the encounter feel professional but personal. He always greets me when he enters the room, asks me how I've been, reviews the previous visits with me, asks if there have been any new updates or changes, if I've been sick lately. The tone he sets for the entire encounter is always very positive. He makes me feel like it's not just about a paycheck or a routine of his daily life. He asks me if I have any questions. If I do have questions, he's always willing and able to answer me honestly and completely. Sometimes he offers up information on natural remedies that usually have no drawbacks. His attitude is always bright and positive and I never have to dread going in for a checkup or appointment for a new issue. I also know he won't speak of it outside of the appointment. He has my confidence.
0.840000	I've had my primary care physician for a very long time and they always give me good recommendations based off of the life that they know I want to live. For example, I'm not really into taking medications if I can help it so if something can be aided naturally by eating healthier or exercising more, they nudge me in that path. Obviously if I have a severe cold or infection, I take their prescription that they recommend but they are aware that if I have to work a little harder to set a goal to get back on track, I'll take that path. And I really appreciate that from them!
0.440000	I do not trust doctors in general. I believe that it all about the money so to speak. Medicine has caused more issues than the ailments it is said to assist with. If one medicine helps with one ailment for example, then it more than likely has at least ten side effects. Not to mention the costs of medicine. If someone is healthy, they make no money. 
0.520000	i usually don't trust doctors in the hospitals close to me, since i don't have a personal physician. for some reason most doctors that i have interacted with in nyc always seem so distant and not caring of whats going on in your life, especially when it comes to your physical health
0.400000	"She is young and doesn't really seem to have confidence in things.  I'll tell her my ailments and symptoms, but nothing really comes of it.  She'll prescribe some drug for depression or mood and have me come back in a month.  After a month, I always feel worse and she's just like ""huh""  Seems to me like it's more about getting you a prescription and out the door.  Get us in, prescribed, and out the door as soon as possible.  Who cares about your symptoms, the side effects of this new drug will make you forget about your old symptoms, because the side effects are worse. "
0.920000	I trust my doctor because she is always looking for and telling me about things I can do to improve my health. 
1.000000	He's always been honest and have had precise diagnosis on my health conditions.. He's also very careful knowing how to handle injurys.
1.000000	i feel my doctor always has my best instrest in mind because he always fixes my problems. i trust him 100%.
0.560000	All in all, I feel doctors have good intentions and generally want to help you. I don't have a primary care physician, so I can't tell you anything about that sort of relationship.
0.800000	My Doctor speaks to me as an intelligent person and makes sure I understand what he is telling me.  I have complete confidence in him.
0.520000	Ive been with my doctors for years so when i have a health issue they usually know the problem and if not they know who to send me to
1.000000	Been with my doctor for many years. When he thought something on my leg looked like could be skin cancer, he didn't wait, he called a dermatologist right away and sent me right over to have it checked.  Sure enough it was skin cancer.
0.680000	My doctor has never done anything to not have my trust. He goes out of his way to make me feel comfortable and is willing to go out of his way for me and my family. To the point of calling me after hours when my oldest was sick and not getting better.
0.760000	I trust my care physician because they go above and beyond what I expect or what I am even interested in.  My physician is completely thorough during my physical and I feel like they want to give the best care possible.
1.000000	My doctor is looking out for me and my health, they look at what is best for me and do what is the right thing. 
0.880000	I trust that a doctor will work in the best interest of all his patients... That would be a main concern for me because everybody wants to maintain good health treatment for themselves...  
0.960000	She's never steered me wrong.  She takes as much times with me as she feels is needed, she's extremely thorough and understands my condition well.
0.440000	The way the laws are setup in this country I feel doctors have to tiptoe around certain issues. For example, If I am in severe pain I feel they would try as many remedies as possible before offering me pain medication due to the stigma the FDA puts on doctors who prescribe them. I feel like a criminal just asking for help with severe pain. If this is how they treat me with that one issue, what other issues are they making worse to protect their own license?
0.960000	I am really comfortable talking to my doctor about treatments and medicines.  I have no problem  discussing anything I don't understand or feel that it's  not the right medicine or treatment for me.  My doctor and I have an open dialog
0.760000	I trust my Primary Care Dr because I have been his patient for 25+ years and he knows me well. While I have never had to disagree with procedures or meds that he prescribes, I believe that if I were to be diagnosed with cancer, he and I may not agree on a treatment. Overall I do not trust most Drs. because of the government involvement and influence on things like prescrition drugs, chemo and their motives for prescribing many things.
0.720000	I have trust in my primary care physician, he be good on alot of care. He be totally honest about all different treatment options in my condition.
0.520000	I think my doctor can be in a hurry and not always listen to what I am saying. She likes to push me off to specialist when I don't always feel I need to see one.
0.360000	They're out for themselves. Whatever brings in the money to pay off their student loans is what matters, especially the kickbacks from pharmaceuticals . The American people are just cattle strolling into their butcher shop.
0.600000	I THINK HE IS A GOOD DR. HE TRIES VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO ME AND HELP ME OUT. WE ALSO TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO HIM. HE IS VERY THOUROGH
0.960000	I have been seeing this doctor for several years.  He is very professiol, approachable and friendly.  He also has very good reviews from other patients. 
0.800000	I trust my Doctor's knowledge and his suggestions for my future health and what is best for me and my family.
1.000000	my doctor is very knowledgeable about medical conditions and has the resources to find the treatment and solution for multiple medical conditions.  I do not have this knowledge.
0.640000	I trust the doctors because they have been in the field and schooling for a long period of time.  I do struggle with them telling me what is convenient for them and what is best for me. 
0.680000	i trust my doctor to a point but them it is up to me to make sure them i get a second opinion then take it from there
0.600000	I have a rare disease called Achalasia. I was so sick I lost over 170 lbs in less than a year, doctors kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me for a year. Doctors kept insisting I had bulimia and it was all in my head, this was not the case at all. If that was the case I would have been binge eating then forcing myself to vomit, instead I would take a few bites of something and regurgitate it afterwards. After seeing over 4 specialists I finally found a doctor who listened to me and understood what was going on and it wasn't in my head. The majority of doctors I saw didn't care about my symptoms and just wanted me out of their offices. This experience made it difficult for me to trust doctors in general. 
0.840000	Whenever I have had a question about my care, my doctor has always been forthcoming and honest about potential treatment plans and side-effects to prescribed medication.  
0.680000	Inboxd I am not a problem, I have been a long way. the only one that won't happen to know that you have a lot of people who are you a lot of people. the first to know about it, and the 
0.960000	"I don't have a primary care physician, I pretty much just go to whoever I'm sent to.  To put it simply, I haven't run into any doctors who did NOT give me any reason to trust them.  All of them have been professional.  True, one of them didn't have a good ""bedside manner"", but that was it.  He still got the job done.  "
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to me and asks questions. He looks at my chart and asks me follow up questions regarding ongoing medical issues. My previous physicians were already writing prescriptions before I finished talking to them and did not bother to look at my file before meeting with me.
0.720000	My doctor listens and allows me to complete my sentences (doesn't interrupt). My doctor asks me pertinent questions.
0.840000	I have along history with my doctor and I know now i can trust him on what he says and I am always the one to ask questions and at time confirm what he says by reading more on the subject
0.600000	I feel that today's doctors are trained to see people as numbers rather than people so it is hard to trust whether or not they really care
0.680000	I have been with her for years she allows me to feel comfortable discussing my problems and tries to give solutions by referring me to specialists 
0.760000	I trust my doctor, all in all i have gotten what i needed from him. He's always been right about my health and given me the right medication. The only thing is that he's always in a rush wished he would spend a little more time answering my questions.
0.960000	My primary care physician always listens to me.  He always answers any questions I have about any of my health issues.
0.720000	For the most part I trust him.  I don't think by any means he would want ill for me but occasionally when nothing seems urgent it feels like his patient overload becomes more important then my concerns.  Also sometimes I wish he would give more thought into different treatment when I may not be comfortable with what he was suggesting. Seems like first idea and his idea is the only idea.
0.680000	My primary care doctor gives me options to different medical situations; if she feels I need to see a particular type of specialist for my condition, then she refers me to one.
0.720000	My last Primary care physician was a confident man that could answer my questions and was very receptive to any suggestions or bringing up other forms of care. 
0.440000	My physician is extremely busy and usually seems preoccupied by something. I live in a rural area and patients are often seen by assistants and students rather than the physician. I am concerned that local practitioners are not up-to-date with current findings. Medicine here seems to consist of ibuprofen, Gatorade and Jesus.
0.920000	My husband and I are currently going through fertility treatment so my primary care physician is a reproductive endocrinologist. She has an amazing track record of helping people get pregnant. She genuinely cares about us and celebrates victories and mourns losses with us. This makes me trust her and her opinions so much more.
0.280000	"I feel like everyone is in a hurry and the perception / feelings is no one really cares. Myself and everyone else is just a number out of billions. I feel like I am just a process and not a person. Dr's tend to see all of their patience day to day, hour to hour, week to week for the purpose of the paycheck and the fincial gains. It has nothing to do with health care or the needs and wants of a persons healthcare, it is all about money and big money at that. Healthcare and everyone involved in the healthcare industry is all about the ""Market"" of making money. "
0.960000	I trust my primary care physician, because I have make seen remarkable results in their work. I have have been a patient with this physician for more than 5 years'.
0.600000	I do not have a primary care physician so it is impossible for me to answer the above questions. For that reason I had to answer neutral.
0.400000	I do not trust my doctor, because it feels like my doctor doesn't trust me when I'm explaining what is wrong with me. It feels like he rushes our appointment instead of taking the time to hear me out.
0.480000	I don't see my pcp that often to have complete trust in her, I also feel as if second opinions are valuable when it comes to health care
0.760000	"Other than those who wish others did not think I do not know what trust is.  I have severe problems with medical professionals as with all fields and would never trust anyone in any ""position"".  The idea itself upsets me."
0.920000	Whenever I went to see the doctor he was always completely honest with me. He would tell me what was wrong or if he wasn't completely sure he would work to figure it out and recommend me to another doctor if he couldn't. When i would go in for check ups he would also give me advise on better ways to improve my health. 
0.800000	I trust my primary care physician in that I believe that he will have my best interests in mind while not trying to rush me out of the door to see the next patient.
0.440000	I feel like doctors get commission for prescriptions that vendors tell them to sell, like hey sell 10 of these and we'll give you 1k, so all these doctors all they do is prescribe shit 
0.960000	I trust me Doctor because she's good listener and try to do the best to help. i dont know much to say about my doctor. But a Doctor who is supportive and very careful about the medication for me to take by providing me with important details such as side affects and how many times daily and Other important ways to be treated. Also asking me about my understanding and any questions so that I can better understand and Explain my concerns regarding my health. Giving me Important places to go for test results. The doctor also follow ups and calls to check up on how I'm comipatients this type of the Doxtor is caring.Doctors are suppose to be very caring about their patients by doing everything as possible to find Answers to theur patients concerns. The Doctor gives pspers and Highlight important Information. The doctor doesnt take long to receive the patient but is always on time to receive the patient. The Doctor is also a serious and hardworking Doctor but also fun and humorous to give the patient like me a Excellent experience with the doctor visit. I am very well pleased with my doctor and am always in good expectation. The Doctor have a clear understanding of every patient and do the best to give excellent satisfaction. 
0.640000	I just think that the hey are trying to get money and they want you to keep coming back and paying co pays and having office visits so they can get hour money 
0.840000	My doctor has been my PCP for years and I trust him. I don't get sick often, but when I do he hits the nail on the head with the diagnosis. He listens and I feel he truly cares about my well being
0.600000	"Trust is a two way street.  The doctors do not trust you when you are in pain.  Because they do not trust you when you are in pain, the doctors decide that it is a good thing to poke and prod you until you actually scream.  After they hear you scream, they then decide that ""oh, maybe you are in pain"". That is when you will be given a hand full of papers otherwise known as referrals, to go to a place where they do x-rays.  After signing in with them, you have to fill out all of the paperwork once again.  It is a tedious job to continue to fill out the same forms over and over again.  The referral doctor takes the x-rays, and tells you to make an appointment with your original (primary) doctor.  The doctor that tells you to make the appointment with the primary doctor will then read your x-rays and send the results to your primary doctor. It seems to me that the primary (original) doctor is just sending you back and forth to different doctors to get additional payments from the insurance company.  I just do not trust any doctor.......they are all out for themselves."
0.600000	I trust them but plan to do further research regarding conditions I visit the doctor for before completely trusting treatment options
0.800000	I trust my doctor because we have a great understanding. We are able to openly communicate and I can also ask any questions that I have. I am comfortable with my doctors. I usually only have doctors I use if I feel comfortable with them.
0.440000	I do not trust my doctor. It's not that he is a bad guy, but he was taught in school to throw pills at most situations. I would rather take a holistic approach to my healing.
0.880000	I trust this doctor due to the good reviews he has also had lots of experience when it comes to it. He also is my sister's doctor.
0.720000	I haven't had that much medically wrong with me through my life. I had my tonsils and adnoids taken out, we thought I had a hernia when I was in junior high and one bout of skin cancer a few years ago but other than that, it's pretty much been colds, flus and bee stings. I've never had a problem with a doctor. I've never had a doctor lie to me, or at least, I've never found out about it. I generally trust people and that holds true for doctors as well. 
0.920000	She has always treated with respect. Explained her answers to questions I had about my health in terms I could understand
0.480000	I distrust some physicians because they are being paid by drug companies. On top of this they often receive a specific training that I may not agree with. Due to this I am more likely to want to see a holistic or alternative physician that I would trust would be open minded like me.
0.640000	She is personable and competent, but like most doctors, she prefers treatment over prevention. She is not always interested in the root cause of something.
0.560000	I think doctors sometimes have people's best interest but not always. Sometimes they are too busy or in it for the money they can milk depends
0.680000	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I trust her to know mainstream illnesses such as flu, colds, strep, UTIs, etc.  I would not have full confidence in her medical knowledge in more rare or extreme illnesses due to her age and lack of experience - she is barely 30 years old.  Also, I fully research any recommendations to verify her information.
0.800000	I have been going to my doctor for years and feel I have a good relationship with him and trust him with providing me with information to take care of myself
1.000000	I have had a bad experience with another doctor.  She is very through and concerned.  She listens and takes her time. 
0.600000	I feel he can do more capable due to his degree but maybe overworked deals with his own health problems some what drained 
0.440000	I am not one to question life I take what it gives me and when life gives me lemons a I take em and make some damn lemonade out of em
1.000000	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and open.  She tells me why she makes a diagnosis.  She gives me time to ask questions.
0.840000	I trust my primary care doctor because they seem fairly personable.  They care about me as a person, and I have known them for almost 20 years. 
0.600000	Times have changed, time being the operative word. These days ,the administrative factors influencing medical care are abounding. Time is money and the less time spent with a patient, the more patients a doctor can see , thus, the care suffers.
0.600000	I trust my doctor completely and she helps me understand and goes out of her way to help and explain my medical situation with her.
0.920000	My primary caregiver has been honest and straight forward since my first visit years ago. I visited for a large splinter that had become infected in my leg. Instead of recommending a costly incision to remove it, he first recommended antibiotics to help the swelling go down with hopes to remove it naturally. I appreciate someone who goes down every possible path to ensure you get the care you need, not the most expensive.
0.800000	Because he never really can tell me what is wrong with me. And I can't understand him clearly which bothers me. And he always blows me off
0.520000	I always feel so rushed during consultations that I feel distrustful of his advice.  Can he really be that careful with my care in fifteen minutes?
0.760000	My primary care physician studied for years at medical schools and colleges in order to learn their practice and become a medical professional. They took an oath to help people and never cause harm and so this causes me to trust them and believe they have my best intentions at heart. 
0.720000	I don't have a whole of interaction with my primary doc (barely a checkup a year), and not many problems (yet), so there's nothing really controversial I wouldn't trust about her diagnoses and prescriptions. Sometimes she does miss items in my history and wanted to prescribe something that wouldn't be a good idea, but I point this out.
0.680000	I feel that yes my doctor may be giving me the best knowledge about my health to the best of her ability, but she is not God who is the ultimate physician. So therefore I can't trust her word.
0.800000	I relay on the physician to make care of the situation that the doctor can determine to right medical knowledge best suited for me.
0.800000	We have a great dialogue with  each other. He seems to actually listen to me, unlike other doctors in my past.
0.800000	i trust my doctor to make the best decisions about my health. we have developed a good partnership over the years.
0.720000	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind but at times they have to many patients and to many things going on and they make quick decisions that may not always be the right one even if they think it was at the time  
0.880000	He have not never steered my wrong or anything else. So I would trust him with my life..and I've nothing else to tell you people 
0.760000	I am somewhat distrustful because of a misdiagnose of one of my children in childhood. It delayed his recovery and caused hospitalization that was not necessary.  I believe you have to be your own advocate.
0.520000	"I think that doctors do care about their patients, but I think that the degree of sympathy strongly correlates to what time you show up in their day. I have found that many doctors don't like to seem wrong, so they will always go to the quickest solution first, and don't tend to really even consider other conditions unless you pry them with questions about relevant symptoms. My problem is mostly with treatment options. Doctors offices are often sponsored by various name brand drugs and that often sways the decision on which drugs to give as treatment. I also don't agree with the trend to do different screening procedures for different insurance plans. It seems that the better your insurance is, the more expensive and more prevalent the testing that is ""required"" becomes. "
0.960000	HE LISTENS TO WHAT I TELL HIM ABOUT MY HEALTH AND IF SOMETHING IS NEEDED, HE WILL EXPLAIN IT TO ME. I ALWAYS WILL GET WHAT EVER TESTING  I NEED DOWN WITHOUT A SQUABBLE.
1.000000	My doctor is very open and honest with me. He never rushed me, answers all of my questions. He goes above and beyond by calling and checking on me. He is very genuine in his treatment.
0.400000	I use a Patient First and although they are my primary care, I do not have one physician that I see.  I often see a Physician's Assistant or a different doctor every time.  It is hard to trust this situation.
0.800000	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. She hasn't let me down and I don't feel like I'm not getting the care I go in for.
0.440000	They have given me wrong diagnosis before- leading to wrong medication and side effects and addition to the HUGE bills!!!
0.720000	Have many years of experience. Have been in the community for decades. Will take the time to listen to my questions and concerns
0.920000	I trust my physicians because they don't rush me when I'm explaining my concerns.  They truly listen and offer advice even it turns out not to be medical
0.920000	I have been knowing my primary care physician for years. Whenever I am having an issue or sick, it is handled immediately. My physician is always honest and up front with me. 
0.920000	The doctor always takes their time when dealing with me and he doesn't feel likes he is in a hurry. He explains every thing that I need to know and ask me if I have any questions. He makes always has me come back for a check up when I get medicine that I need to see if it is working like it supposed to. I do trust my doctor to act on my interests.
0.320000	Poor bedside manner caused me to switch doctors, now I see a nurse practitioner who takes time to explain the condition and is much more pleasant to be around
0.960000	I trust my doctor because he tells me what is happening without sugar coating it and I really appreciate that.
1.000000	My PCP doctor has been treating me for more than 20 years now.  He also is part of a very small practice that is in the country side.  Even though I live farther away from his practice now, I still commute to see him because I trust him based on our long history and the experiences I have had with him in the past.  He tends to be very honest with me with regards to everything that we talk about. 
0.640000	MY primary care is quite good, great bedside manner, willing to try whatever works. I've found she is better than other doctors I have seen, and is open to looking at studies, research, alternative treatments, and works WITH me.
0.800000	My primary doctor shows empathy and actually listens to what i have to say to him. He's honest with me about everything. He tries his best to help me whether its getting a referral to someone else or getting information for me.
0.840000	My doctor is very persoble and understanding when I am having problems struggling with depression and anxiety. When I have needed extra help, she has recommended other helpful resources for me to take advantage of, and when I've needed medication changes, she has helped me set up appointments with a psychiatrist.
1.000000	I have had my doctor for a long time. He seems my entire family and children. He is kind and patient. Makes sure you understand everything and does not rush with you.
0.480000	my old doctor was wonderful he explained everything in a way someone could understand and he was nice and cared.  He got a new job with the government and now I go to his partner he had at the practice.  The new doctor (old doctors partner) doesn't care...he just wants to get you in and out of there fast.
0.920000	I have known him for a long time now. He has often been honest to me about my weight and that I should try harder to manage it.
0.720000	I trust it because I'm treated well there so I trust what they're doing all the tine and know I don't need to switch over to a different physician 
0.880000	I trust our primary care physician but prefer to deal with her exclusively and not her Physician Assistants. The PA's that work at her medical office aren't quite as knowledgeable and don't provide the same level of thorough analysis required for our day to day health needs.
0.720000	They have experience but very alert of some doctors but mostly they are trustful and put their patients first 
1.000000	I trust my doctor because he always listens when I express concerns. He takes what I say into consideration and does not dismiss me rudely. He treats me as if he cares about me as a person not just a patient.
0.840000	My doctor tells me like it is. She's honest and thorough with me. She tries to relate to me. And speaks to me in a way I would understand.
0.720000	I have no reason to not trust him. I don't believe that he would knowingly do anything to harm me and he has no reason to lie to me. Also I've grown to trust him after seeing him for some time. 
0.680000	Because my doctor doesn't rush through my examinations and takes the time to speak with me about my health and well being I feel I can trust him/her almost all of the time.
0.520000	I kinda don't trust my eye care professional doctor that much. He never told me the side effects of my medicine or even my condition to what was wrong with my eye. He seems to only care if he gets paid. He sometimes seems rude also. Having me wait when he is doing absolutely nothing and conversing with nurses about nonsense when everyone besides him has a schedule.
0.560000	I trust my doctor because I have no one else I can trust. I live a lonely life. I know that he is one of the only people that I interact with daily who does not wish to inflict some sort of harm (bodily or otherwise) on me. Doctor client privilege also makes me feel very safe with the medical staff that assist me at the hospital, so I know that anything i say can be documented in complete confidence. 
0.880000	I have never had bad experiences with my doctors in the past, so I have no reason to doubt them. most doctors care about their professiol reputation and will not be willing to jeopardize that.
0.800000	She actually cares, she listens to resolve instead of listening to respond. She allows me to speak and fully explain myself without cutting me off like most doctors. 
0.520000	I have never had a doctor that I trust 100% because they are human beings and they see a lot of clients in one day and have made plenty of mistakes. It is up to me to stay vigilant and decide on how to proceed based on my doctors suggestions.
0.800000	There is no reason to not be honest about any conditions. I see a physician once a year and take no medications, so there's nothing much to tell.
0.720000	I trust them for the most part. I haven't had any issues where they were wrong. Most of my experiences with doctors have resulted in proper solutions for why I was there.
0.600000	"I know multiple cases of healthcare providers that pressure doctors to perform ""low risk"" treatments that have ultimately harmed their patient in the long run until     their insurance ran out. This is an issue with insurance companies, however the medical profession seems to be tied with them on some level."
0.440000	she is curt, rolls her eyes when i tell her what is going on with my body, she is dismissive. she doesn't tell me stuff like do not  take your thyroid pill before your blood work, so my blood work is screwed up, i know she does not believe things i have had tested or experienced in the past are true facts. they are quite oddities and hard to believe, but yet all of them tested at least 3x before the dr's back then believed what was going on. it is my fault i am still with her, but my file could probably go around the earth once. i am lazy and honestly do not want to fill out new patient info sheets. when i do see a new dr, i have them send me the forms and it usually takes me about 3-5 days to fill them out.  i am content to know what i am dealing with my mean dr.
0.920000	Doctors are generally better educated and up to what's current in health care.  I have trusted my doctor for many years now.  He was the first one to recognize that I needed surgery.
0.880000	I trust my doctor because she seems up to date on everything new and lets me know the best options fo rme without breaking our budget
0.920000	I trust my oncologist to treat me in a way that if best for me. She makes sure I understand everything and takes the time to listen and respond in a way that is clear to me.  I feel that she cares and does not rush me through my appointments.
0.400000	In general I have a distrust for my primary care physician and doctors in general. I feel this way because whenever I have had a medical issue it is rare that I get any kind of resolution or any real help. I feel that doctors are so quick to medicate and not find out what the underlying issue is creating the problem. Because any doctors are of any real help I try to avoid going to them even when I need it. It seems like no matter how many blood tests or other kinds of medical tests one gets there is never any resolution to the problem only a cover up of the problem. I feel like doctors just cover the surface and never really dig deep to understand the problem. I do believe there are rare doctors that will dig deep and get the medical problem and try to solve it, but these doctors are extremely rare. In addition I feel like doctors do not take time with their patients anymore. There is no caring. It feels like they try to see as many patients as possible and never really take the time to get to know someone and their needs. In all I can't trust doctors anymore. At one time I trusted them more but I have seen the medical profession really decline in quality of care. 
0.440000	Primary care physician might not have enough knowledge to make an informed decision. The doctor might not be up to date with the latest treatments.
0.800000	My doctor has been my doctor for over ten years. He is never rushed and always takes time to answer my questions and concerns.  I like that he values my input and will look up things that I tell him about.  He seems genuinely concerned about my care.  He is easy to talk to.
0.840000	He seems to know what he is doing and knows the technical terminology when we discuss my problems. He seems to have empathy as well.
0.640000	Happily I've not had serious medical problems requiring decision making or second opinions.   My PCP is a kind but busy man and I do feel strongly that if I do develop a serious issue he might not be the best care giver. 
0.720000	I generally have a trust but I am suspicious in nature so I research what is told or I ask a second opinion if I feel the wrong information is given. I have only had this doctor for a month so trust is not absolutely at this time.
0.640000	My doctor tends to be really straightforward without sugarcoating anything. If I have something wrong with me, then he just says it and tells me how to treat it. 
0.720000	I trust my doctor because I believe it is morally good for them to provide me with honest and thorough information. They should be able to make us trust them as our lives are dependent on them because sickness is a very serious thing. I also trust them because they should be knowledgeable about every pain we experience and they should be a guide to advice on what to eat and do and all other necessary precautions we should take to alleviate whatever abnormality we're feeling
1.000000	My doctor has never wronged me. He is very friendly and always answers my questions. He genuinely cares about my health and his solutions have always worked.
0.800000	He has taken the time out to really make sure I understood concepts by drawing pictures, which I haven't experienced with other doctors. He is against the use of certain medications that are addictive, but the most helpful in situations. I needed an anti anxiety medicine that would help and he preferred to prescribe medicine that did not really help rather than giving me medicine that absolutely would. 
0.600000	"I trust most doctors in general as long as they can explain why they recommend the things they do. I need more than a ""you need to do this"" explanation."
0.440000	"I think he is too focused on certain health issues (my weight) and not focused enough on the things that are causing me to have poor quality of life (chronic migraine, chronic pain from arthritis) even though my poor quality of life is a major factor in why I am overweight - because I'm uble to exercise without pain, I have no energy to cook healthy food, etc. etc. But people don't like ""fat chicks"" and doctors always seem to focus on that as a #1 problem no matter what. "
0.280000	Because I think doctors only care about the bottom line, Money.  Rarely have I ever met a doctor I thought he knew what he was doing ! 
0.600000	I trust my primary care physician because she takes care of me and my baby so i chose her and trust her.
0.440000	I don't always trust everything the doctor says and seem to spend more time talking to the nurse asking questions. The doctors seem to think they know everything and don't ask many questions. I't understandable they seem pressed for time as I can understand why that would be true. I do think that is the main reson for a lack of trust though it may not always be true.
0.720000	I do trust the doctors I see for the most part. In a few cases it seems that they are not engaging with me emotiolly. If I feel emotiol connected to a doctor I am more likely to trust them
0.440000	I believe his heart is in the right place, but he makes sp judgements regarding care. Sometimes he says one thing then does something else, or doesn't do what he said he would do. Medical science is often wrong regarding treatments and doctors in general are too busy to keep up with the latest changes.
0.760000	She is a good doc but doesnt always like to do what i feel is right treatment for me. Example. I would like the shot for shingles but she says i am not old enough. I also want the pheunemenacocal shot she wont give it. I am almost 51 and want prtected before i get sick
0.760000	I trust her as she knows i am the kind of person who will bring an issue to her, take my meds appropriately and calls me back
0.800000	i trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them for many years and they have always been very caring and helpful no matter the situation. i also trust them because i think they want to have a good reputation so they do their best with me as a patient.
0.640000	Physicians are trustworthy. But you know that it's understandablec on why some people aren't trusting of physicians. 
0.880000	I trust my doctor completely, he has the knowledge to tell me all the options that I have for what is wrong with me.  We will talk it over and come up together with what we are going to do.
0.800000	I've been seeing them for most of my life since I was a young child.  I believe they've always treated me with their best interest and care.
0.720000	I think my doctor has my best interests at heart, even if she is very busy.  She always has a lot of patients but she has shown genuine care for me.  She takes the time to give me all the options for treatment and explains them.
0.600000	I feel they are too busy inputing data in the computer to be able to hear my issues.  My meds were inputted wrong and I am having a devil of a time to solve that issue. I tell that what I need and then it does not get done.  And I have to call and hound them for weeks to get my issues resolved. It is horrible that you can not trust the office staff to do what needs to be done.  I am able to voice my opinion but some people do not understand that they need to disagree and have a voice in their treatment plans.
0.600000	It depends on the individual personality of the physician, which can vary widely just like individuals in other professions.
0.800000	I trust my doctor and the medication that she give me because she know what going to help me and would wont help me
0.840000	I trust my physician because all the advice I get is positive and it changes my future. I also follow through everything.
1.000000	FIRST, HE IS WELL EDUCATED AND HAS TAKEN AN OATH.   SECOND, I DID RESEARCH ABOUT HIM AND HIS BACKGROUND.  ALSO, I CAN TELL BY HIS PERSOLITY AND TALKING WITH JIM.
0.880000	I have been going to the same doctor for 14 years and have only had good experiences.  She listens and does not always push medications.
0.240000	It seems that doctors rarely truly listen. They think they know everything and they should never be second guessed even though the field of medicine is still growing and learning and the physician didn't seem like they listened in the first place (but they know). Usually whenever I have a question they never answer it satisfactorily and without taking any tests and/or additional tests (for questions about my health that would require additional tests that no physician would know otherwise).
0.720000	I don't have a primary care physician. I haven't even been to the doctor since I was a kid. But I don't see any reason not to trust your doctor. What advantage could he gain by lying?
0.520000	My PCP is not somebody that I see very often. I have not gone to my PCP regularly for about 5 years now. I only go if there is something seriously wrong, which has only been like 2 times in the past 5 years.
0.760000	It's not that I don't trust him I just think he has limited information.  No one can be on top of all of the new treatments but I think he does the best he can.  He is happy to refer me to specialists or others that might have a better grasp of a health issue.  For that reason alone, I have learned to trust his guidance.
0.840000	I trust my primary care physician because he has never failed to solve my problems, he has always done his best to find the best solutions for me.
0.760000	Doctors in general do a great job. I have run into some that haven't and it makes me realize that I need to be careful with the doctor I visit. Most doctors are very considerate and will provide info, but some are more interested in seeing as many patients as possible.
0.680000	"i believed all doctors Truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard.[1] Truth may also often be used in modern contexts to refer to an idea of ""truth to self,"" or authenticity. Truth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, and religion"
0.840000	I completely without a shadow of a doubt have complete and total trust in my PHYSICIAN. He and She ate awesome in what they do
0.680000	I trust my physician a whole lot. I trust that he/she will give me the perfect advice all or most of time at least and wouldn't stir me the wrong way.
0.800000	My primary care physician is a caring individual that is very qualified to be my doctor. And they help make me understand my health needs with regularity.
0.800000	My primary physician and I are a team. He knows me well enough to suggest various options for health care with me first before just ordering test or medications. I normally tell him what is wrong and how I think I should be treated and he will either agree or recommend a different course. I trust his opinions and feel very confident in discussing issue with him if I have concerns about what he says to me.
0.800000	I've known my primary care physician most of my life, and he has never given me a reason not to trust him. 
0.840000	Because he always do the right thing for me and is always making sure I do what I need to also if I have any project I can talk to him
0.760000	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician. I believe that they are the most capable person to diagnose and treat my medical conditions and that they have my best interests in mind.
0.880000	My primary care physician tales more time with me than any primary care physician I've ever had. He never rushes my appointment and, in fact, he al,oat always runs late due to his extraordinary care and attentiveness 
0.560000	"i have a difficult time in general trusting only one person with something serious, so i don't have ""complete"" trust in the doctors i see. i value their opinions and typically do what they think is best unless there's a good reason not to, but i wouldn't call it complete trust"
0.680000	She has shown me that she wants the best for me and my well being
0.600000	well fost off I just want to say that in no way shape or form I have a primary care physician and I also have little experience with doctors
0.400000	I feel that medicine is a business and not a one on one profession.   The doctor tries to make money off you.
0.960000	My doctor treats me like a friend, breaks everything down so I can understand her. She is extremely friendly.
0.840000	My Primary care doctor has always been there for me when I have questions. I can communicate with her via email and she will see me if I really need to come in with almost no advance notice.  She explains things well and cares if I  am OK.
0.800000	I have never had any problems with my primary care physician. He is very experienced, wise , efficient and considerate. 
0.640000	I feel that they are in a hurry sometimes, and i get the feeling it is about the money, and  they are too quick to perscribe pills instead of trying other treatments first
0.720000	I have to trust that my doctor is going to say and do what is in my best interests. I want to know exactly what can be and needs to be done in order to get or stay healthy. I want to be confident that my doctor is going to do the things that they have sworn to do as a medical professional, and thinking that they may not be doing so is too upsetting to even consider. 
0.800000	Because I have been with him awhile and I would say health wise he knows everything about my health to make a good decisions about  my over all health
0.600000	i have been misdiagonsied in the past and have changed dr because of this i also have had bad experiences when i knew i was sick and they refuse to treat me untill i have almost be hospitalized. I really feel that they don't know there pt and really just treat u like a number and a bill
0.480000	The doctor I've been seeing is mean and ignort. Can't ask him questions and get scared to say anything at all around him. Even his nurses look like they Dont want to ask anything
0.480000	feel that she is rushed and doesn't have the time to address my concerns. i'd like to try a different type of a medication and also manage my chronic conditions better
0.760000	I trust my doctor for the most part because gives complete exam and extra test if needed to make I am not experiencing any other health problems
0.720000	My doctor is a little impersonal so I dont distrust him but I dont trust him fully either, sometimes he very attentive and other times he is apathetic and doesnt give a care about me so its hard to decipher which day he is which.
0.800000	I trust my doctor because he takes the time to explain things to me such as test results or what needs to be done to make me feel better and why. Also he is very observient and notices changes I make in my appearance.
0.920000	I trust my primary physician because he will let you know if he is unfamiliar with a condition and wii arrange for you to see someone else 
0.680000	I trust her for the most part except when I had my first kid she didn't figure out ahead of time that my baby was breech so I ended up having an unexpected C-section. 
0.840000	I feel that my primary care physician always listens to me so this has helped build up my trust over the years.  I have always felt she has taken the best path for my medical needs.
1.000000	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for almost 4 years now, give or take, and he has always been a very very truthful, and integrity based person. He tells it how it is, and he is a doctor who doesn't like to just prescribe medication and be over with it. He takes the time to sit and talk to figure out exactly what the problem is, and if some type of medication is needed or absolutely necessary he will prescribe it. Otherwise we find different ways of dealing with it or try a lower tier of medication than something that could be addictive or hazardous to health. He is a genuine doctor and I have never had any issues with him.
0.680000	My doctor has achieved a medical doctrine, that took years to get. I have to trust him to a certain point. Honesty if I have doubts then that's when I patronize a different medical establishment. 
0.400000	My physician does what is best for her. she very rarely reads my medical record before I get there so I have to explain why I am there even if it is a routine checkup that she made 
0.600000	I belong to a family care practice. I only go once a year for monitoring of my condition. Each time I go there is a new doctor right out of medical school assigned to me. The old doctor has moved on. It is hard to generate trust if the old face has gone somewhere else. 
0.480000	I have actually gone to my doctor self diagnosed, only to have him tell my I was wrong, but later realize I was correct. I've also caught him being dishonest by neglecting to tell about specific treatment options, and even explaining options incorrectly.
0.800000	I have had good experiences so far, he is thorough and very good at explaining all aspect of the treatments he dispenses and is an excellent listener 
0.560000	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I always like to question my doctor though. Itâs part of my nature.
0.720000	The most obvious things that have changed the perception of medicine over these last forty years include high profile cases of physician fraud, drug abuse, drug pushing, malfeasance, gross malpractice, even murder.   What in the past was often hushed up, or discounted as highly unusual, have now become grist for the media mill.  To say that physiciansâ images have been tarnished by these instances would be an understatement.
0.920000	I have known my doctor all of her life in fact her hold family Also I feel she will do what is best for me
0.640000	I want to trust my doctor, or any doctor. I sometimes have a hard time doing so though because all-in-all, it is just a profession and if these doctors fixed all sick people and issues happened less and less, doctors jobs would become more and more scarce so some things are not treated properly or correctly so that it can keep people in the healthcare system to make money and keep doctor's jobs.
0.560000	I've had persistent neck pain for the last decade and was prescribed all sorts of treatment ranging from medication to injections. After basically giving up I found a simple over-the-counter medication that worked and had never been recommended.
0.440000	My primary care physician does not care to fully diagnose me or most of his patients for that matter. He will do a series of tests or ask questions to get a general idea of what may be wrong, and will then prescribe antibiotics, painkillers, etc. without even confirming I actually need the medicine.
0.520000	My last primary care physician wasn't necessarily a bad doctor, but she was pretty busy and quick to get my appointments over with. She even ended up missing key signs of a very serious problem I was having by diagnosing the symptoms as common ailments that had nothing to do with each other though she's not to blame for that (it was a very bizarre chain of events that led to the discovery of my problems). I know she did what she could with what she knew but I think if she spent more time with me in my appointments, maybe she would have seen something different.
0.800000	I trust my doctor to an extent. I am aware that no one doctor has all of the answers so i try to take her advice with a grain of salt
0.720000	I don't think my doctor takes enough time with me, or patients in general, to really know what is best. I think that my doctor relies on drugs too quickly and too often as the solution to the problem.
0.600000	I have a lack of trust with physicians when they seem to be completely distant from me when I am giving them information or explaining my situation. It boils down to them having a lack of social skills - I often feel like when I am being shooed out of an office to get me out as soon as possible, it feels as though I am not worth their time. Again, this often happens when I am at an urgent care clinic or with doctors that I am seeing for the very first time. Also, a lack of professionalism shows me that they could potentially be wrong about a prescription. 
0.520000	I feel that my primary care physician has a very heavy work load and sometimes may be in such a rush that she misses something. She missed by back pain that was actually a kidney stone, for example.
0.760000	i think most of them do what is right for the patients but some dont. i have a good amount of trust in doctors
0.960000	My doctor is very persoble and doesn't talk down to you when he explains things. I have been lucky enough to not have any serious health issues in a long time, so I don't really have any reason to distrust him. He's never given me anything that I'd call bad advice, and he did give me some useful info about the tension headaches that I get now and then.
0.560000	I really try and put faith into what they are telling me.  I have been known to challenge them somewhat if the diagnoses does not make any sense to me.
0.600000	It is not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician. Instead, it is simply wanting to question things in order to protect myself regardless. This method works for my best interest.
0.800000	My primary care doctor is great - she is very direct and straightforward while also being friendly and pleasant. She does not sugar-coat and is open to my getting second opinions, and she is happy to answer all of my questions (I bring lists). She never seems rushed.
1.000000	My doctor always seem to have time for me in general and she is very open to what I have to say. And she always listen.
0.840000	My Doctor has not given me a reason not to trust them. When I go into the office I feel like I am always well cared for and that my doctor genuinely cares about my health. 
0.680000	I often feel like the doctors are overworked and they have to rush between patients, so they only spend a few minutes with you. This isn't really enough time to be thorough and careful despite how good their intentions might be. I don't have a problem with communicating to the nurses, but I sometimes wonder if all of the information is actually being conveyed to the doctor or not.
0.600000	I only get 10-15 minutes with my physician. She's overworked, I don't think doctors have the time to fully explain everything to each patient.
1.000000	I hVe had medical issues in the past and he was completely open and honest about all he options available to me whether good or bad
0.400000	"I have gone to see my doctor about trouble i am having that had nothing to do with my weight, however he will always tell me something about ""loosing weight will make you feel better"" or connect everything to my weight. I already know loosing weight will make me feel better, i have lost 81 pounds and feel alot better, but can you please just help me with the problem i actually came in for! Speaking of loosing weight, he has tried several times to convince me that i should change my diet from eating moderate protein and high fat, to something that includes more vegetables. Meanwhile when i was a vegetarian i was still pre diabetic and overweight, but now that i only eat meat i am no longer a risk for getting diabetes, as a doctor i would think he would be convinced by that proof, but he still tries to convince me i am wrig and tries to get me to take meds i don't think i need."
0.720000	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  But I know that we are all human and humans make mistakes.
0.600000	been dealing with my doctor for along time trust what she says                                                        
0.400000	"I just feel that the doctors are just following what is on the screen or what the head of their department wants. For example in pregncy they do a ""diabetes blood screen"" at 6 months and they make you drink an aweful glucose gmo drink. Now it has come out there are lots and lots of different options of what to drink or even just doing diabetes testing for a few days/week but still the places go ahead and do it because ""protocol"" or like if you have a csection, they force you to a 2nd one or pay extra money to get one with only a few doctors with waiting lists. It's very stressful to have people just blindly following protocol instead of listening to what you need and want and working for you. "
0.360000	Sometimes doctors prescribe you medication that you don't really need. They're also more likely to recommend a procedure that costs more. Doctors work to make money, I think there are few doctors who are ethical but most of the ones I've been to are not.
0.600000	I trust them because obviously they must be doing something right to be in business
0.800000	I have not seen a doctor in 8 years.I feel stress often but after seeing what kind of stress they go through,I will take on my own issues.
0.760000	Well I trust my Doctors sometimes. I think they have my best interest in mind, but I can overcome the nagging feeling that them just a paycheck to them
0.920000	I have had the same doctor for awhile now so i just know her really well and feel comfortable enough with her to trust her
0.720000	i have to trust them becuace they are looking out for my welfare. when dont follow instructions they why would i go see them.sometimes i think they dont understand the problem i have and i might second guess thier reasoning behind what they say
0.400000	At the moment, I am in between a primary care physician.  I have been with an internal medicine doctor as my primary care doctor for almost 30 years and for the last two years (I go in once a year for a physical checkup), I feel I wasted my time.  He read my blood work and didn't even ask if I had any questions or problems to address.  I now have an appoint next month to see a new internal medicine doctor.
0.800000	seems to have adequate knowledge and does necessary tests yo diagnose problems. Seems interested in my problems.
0.720000	My doctor seems to take a genuine interest in me and my concerns.  She spends time with me and answers all of my questions in a way that I can understand.  
0.920000	I trust them cause the are trust worthy I guess it comes with there scope of practice I have not had reasons To not trust them most atimes I want to see a doctor knowing I will feel better and it happens so
0.920000	I trust my physician because when i have any doubt he is always there to help me and understand any difficulty that i am going through. H e tells me things more in a friendly way than in a doctor type of serious situation. I completely put all my trust in him and he has given me alot of reasons to trust him.
0.760000	I recently changed primary care doctors. I had my first appointment with her and so far I feel she is doing a good and thorough job.
0.760000	my reasoning to why i trust my primary care physician is because she makes feel like i can be open with my doctor. 
0.880000	I fully trust my PCP because I feel that she is open and allows me to play a large role in my own healthcare. When I discuss my health with her, it is very natural and not uncomfortable. She allows me to make decisions together with her and she always listens to my concerns and opinions.
0.600000	I have had surgery in the past where the doctor told me there were two different options on the way he could perform the procedure.  I told him that I highly preferred the one method and didn't want the other at all.  He chose to do it the way I didn't want because it was easier for him.  Sometimes they don't tell you everything either, if they don't think you can handle it. 
0.200000	Because they think they know everything and they dont. We are not at the brink of medical technology. They still dont have a cure for the common cold.
0.880000	I have had the same doctor all of my life and rely on them to make sure I feel good in all situations.  I believe that normally all people are in this world to do good, especially doctors as I know they are there to look out for people.
0.640000	They just leave me alone for hours then they get mad when you ask questions . They get angry and rush you out.
0.200000	I distrust my PCP and the conventional medical doctors because they are only trained in drugs and surgery.  It is a big business and no one is allowed to deviate from it even if the results are in the best interest of the patient. You look around and see so many people sick, how can I trust the doctors?  Doctors still think soda is ok to drink!
0.680000	I'm neutral on the trust issue.  I've had nothing happen with my physician which would make me feel strongly either way.
0.920000	My doctor is from India and she seems to be well educated. She goes over everything and send you to specialist. If she thinks the is a need too
0.800000	I trust him hes a good man. Very funny. Spends a good amount of time with me. And my health benefits.
1.000000	For any health conditions I had, my doctor has been very knowledgeable concerning every question I ask. Very knowledgeable about the pills I take and what can be done physically to resolve issues.
0.600000	Ifeel my doctor is competent,so there for I trust in his ability to care for me he has not given me a reason to be distrustful of him. I feel comfortable when I have office visits with him,and he appears to care about my well being.
0.520000	Sometimes doctors aren't always honest with you. Even when something as simple as a cold they can give you medicine that's not necessary. Some doctors do actually have the time to make sure you are fine with what they are giving you to help you heal
0.720000	This one is hard to answer because my old doctor retired and I now have a new doctor that I've only seen once.  She seems ok, but very different than my previous doctor who was really personable.  She is more professional and not really into have a relationship with her patients.
0.720000	Doctors in general. Are great for the world.  89 percent of dr.s are good at wat they. Afew dr.s make mistakes as any other human.  Dr.s should continue to evalate their patients and keep saving lives. And also 
0.560000	"As recently as TODAY, May 4, 2017, the US Congress is voting on repealing ""Obama-care"". This whole concept of the free market guiding healthcare is absurd. The US is long overdue to adopting tiolized health. I hate to use this worn out saying but, if the US can put men on the Moon, and now spacecraft to Mars and Pluto, then the US can easily have basic healthcare to cover its' citizens. Doctors are hindered by insurance companies and people have ridiculous expectations as to what healthcare should be."
0.560000	I am in the middle about trusting or distrusting my primary care physician because some doctors only care about money than about your well being.
0.800000	All doctors to me should be trusted until they've done something wrong. They wouldn't be in their position if they weren't given trust to start. I'm not saying ALL should be trusted, but all should be given a fair chance!
0.640000	I generally trust my doctor. I have been with him for years and would not continue the relationship if I had doubts about his care. When it comes to my health I am somewhat cautious so I do not completely trust my doctor.
0.720000	Usually my appointments are so quick I feel like they just want to get me in and out of the office as quickly as possible and are annoyed if I ask too many questions
0.520000	i mostly trust my doctors but I need to double check through independent research to have full confidence
0.680000	I don't like being pushed to have flu shots and also having to take certain medications for 'maintenance' reasons.
0.480000	Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I never put full trust in doctor's because they are human. They don't know everything and I always question.
0.520000	I distrust in in part because I feel that he is looking out for the facility rather than for the patient. It takes longer to get the real test that you need, because they want the doctors to try other things first.
0.520000	The few doctors I had some don't seem to interested. They just ask for symptoms then just prescribe medicine. They feel like their disinterest. Just write a prescription and your done.
0.800000	I don't see my PCP often, but when I do he is very straightforward with me. He expresses his concerns if he has any. He then gives a list of options for treatment(s) and allows me to decide which course to follow. If there are any issues I have a variety of ways in which I can reach out to him and he is prompt at responding.
0.600000	i trust my primary care because she always is there for me and helps me and has given me no reason not to trust her 
0.400000	I trust him because he is qualified. HIs advices in the past have been good for me. I have benefitted from listening to his advices.
0.880000	My doctor took the time to answer all my questions. My doctor followed up with me and sat down with me one on one for as long as it took for every concern. She is very kind and did not make me feel like I was burdening her. She called me and made sure I was okay after a procedure and made sure I did not have any other questions she could help answer. all in all she made me feel very comfortable. Even the nurses were very prompt in returning calls and making me feel like I was the only patient they had. I hope everyone has the same experiences I did during that difficult time. 
0.680000	I trust medical professiols except in the rare instances where I know more than they do. That's scarily common in mental health fields, especially.
0.520000	I want to say that I completely agree with my doctor but some of the things that he says I find it to be true
0.720000	I don't distrust my primary physician, he just doesn't completely understand how to handle my current condition. He tends to defer to my other doctors, who I don't trust much at all. 
0.840000	He's very sympathetic and a good listener.  I have been going to him over 20 years.  He's never steered me wrong
0.880000	I trust my physician Because she asks the right questions and helps me out. She just doesn't rush through the appointments
0.600000	i trust my primary care physician. my doctor is totally honest in telling you about all of the treatment options.
0.600000	Overall I have slight trust in the medical world. I think my doctor is persuaded by large pharma companies and I think a lot of the times they do things that are easier or make more money.
0.600000	I like my primary care physician, but I don't really trust the technology that is used.  I don't trust that information entered into computers is always correct and not entered into someone else's account.  I would not trust everything that is done or said if it didn't seem to make sense.
0.440000	I think my doctor cares more about making a profit than my well-being. He will talk about my condition and answer questions, but anything that doesn't involve pharmaceutical drugs, he shuts down as bogus. I don't believe that. I don't feel he is very thorough and I really only go to the doctor if absolutely necessary. 
0.760000	I've been going to the same doctor for several years. He's become a close family friend and keeps my best interest in mind always .
0.800000	"I've always had a good experience with my primary care physician. I can understand why some people might have had a bad experience with their persol doctors, but that doesn't mean their experience is the only experience anyone has ever had with doctors - my experience with doctors has certainly been positive. I'm certainly not desperate enough to rely on those ""THINGS DOCTORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW"" ads, anyways."
0.560000	He is constricted by the corporation that employs him. He's clearly under a great deal of pressure, probably dealing with more patients than he can comfortably deal with. 
0.720000	i respect them because they help me alot concerning my health.they  do tell me reality whenever i visit them and they give me advices about coping with life experiences. through them,i have a sense of belonging even when i tend to feel that my life is meaningless
0.520000	I think Dr offices have become more of an assembly line, long waits and I just think sometimes they are so rushed patients do not get enough time to get all their questions answered and time to gather information about medications and treatment options in depth.
0.720000	One of the main reasons I trust my doctor is that he actually listens to me unlike some doctors.  He takes what I say in to consideration and knows that I am familiar with my body and that I usually am on par with what he is thinking.
0.280000	I grew up around a lot of christain science folks and saw how healthy they are. most long term medication has consequence and I avoid it. Doctors are trained to treat symptoms, not the problems cause
0.920000	I totally trust my physician because he is dependable, intelligent, caring, and just a great man. He is versed in his profession and moreover very easy on the eyes.
0.840000	I trust my physician because I have a long history over many years. I have experience with situations where there were options and feel my physician always had my best interest at heart and offered me the truth.
0.640000	I trust my primary doctor in all the basics.  But, I have not had to question about something serious, at this point.  Sometimes my doctor seems too busy, but she has never ignored a question or concern
0.800000	My doctor does not have any hesitation in telling me how it is with my health.  If I balk at doing something he is suggesting he will be very blunt on why it has to be done.  He has never steered me wrong, I trust what he says.
0.760000	My doctor has been a doc for over 25 years and has always given the best options available for what my ailment has been. I trust her whole heartedly 
0.960000	I trust all doctors to a point, and that point is there is a LOT of new information out there, new discoveries, theories and medicines. The average primary care physician cannot possibly learn it all.    When I had diverticulosus, the surgeon was going to remove part of my colon, and told me I may or not need a colonoscopy bag. I daughter and another friend looked up liposcopic surgery, and suggested that to drain the shit that was filling my abdomen. The surgeon agreed to try. It was successful. When he finished, the surgeon declared that if he ever had diverticulosus, he would want this procedure. I think we can trust our doctors, but we need to educate ourselves to make life better for all of us.
0.480000	My dr only cares about getting out of your room and on to the next person. I am looking for a new dr. At the moment.
0.280000	i DONT THINK SHE HAS TIME TO LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS. SHE ONLY WANTS TO TREAT ONE LITTLE THING WHEN i THINK THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. SHE GIVES MEDS TO QUICKLY
0.800000	i have known him for a long time and he is honest and dependable to a fault.  he is always clear and concise in his diagnoses and instructions for treatment.
1.000000	My doctor has always been proactive in my care and scheduled any tests that I may need. I would recommend my doctor to all my friends and family 
0.520000	I distrust my primary care physician because alot of times he acts as though I am an idiot. I know all of the lingo that is used in the hospitial and he never even took a minute to get to know me.
0.720000	I know I can trust my PCP because of the time she spends with me during a visit and the questions she asks. She always listens to me and has a good answer. She and her staff follow through with what I need.
0.800000	He seems to know what he is talking about so I trust him.
0.800000	Had my doc for ten years now.  In a small town with limited healthcare I was nervous, but first time I met the guy, I knew he was ok. Has all the latest do dads to measure the blood pressure and all.  Always knows whats best.
