1	Same answer as the first answers, my mother's cancer. I keep meticulous notes, read medical jourls, question our health team very closely, and follow message boards a bit obsessively. I quit my job to deal with this. I live it.
1	I once was on the scene of a car crash in the middle of the night. It was on a small road and there was no one there except the people in the crashed car and my husband and I. The woman in the crashed car was bleeding profusely from what seemed to be a deep wound and I tried to slow the flow of blood by applying pressure on the wound and calming her while we were waiting for emergency responders.

-1	When I had allergies and I had to look up online what can help treat it and went to the store and got an over the counter product that can help.

1	I was living with my grandmother who needed assistance taking her medicine. I had to read the instructions for each prescription in order to give her the medicine at the correct times and the correct amounts.
-1	I was having back pain and knew that I would need to go to the doctors and that there was probably something wrong with my back that would not be curable passed off of research that I did online and that I would probably need to do ohysical therapy and exercise reguarly and when I went to the doctors it turned out I was right and ended up having to do physical therapy and was given a set of exercises to do everyday.
-1	When I had a baby I read books on  the delivery procedure. I learned all of the steps to the delivery.
1	I do not know. I've had a few medical issues in life but have overcome or live with the consequences of them today, so I rarely think about 'what I know'. I don't know what that means, 'demonstrate'....to who? I don't need to demonstrate to anyone, I just need to take care of myself.
1	I went through secondary infertility. I had to learn lots of statistics regarding my chances of conceiving again, as well as the different methods and treatments I should try and their corresponding levels of success.
-1	I had a mammogram years ago. It showed a possible cyst or lump in the breast. The cost of the 2nd scan was $650, which was out of pocket. Turned out that I did not have cancerous cysts, but it cost me quite a bit for proof.
1	I was very flushed and was having a reaction to something I ate. I realized that there were nitrates in my meat that were causing the reaction. I wasn't panicked because I knew the cause and to avoid them in the future.
1	Having my spouse diagnosed with diabetes and understanding that that was an increase in sugar in the blood.  Knowing that the pancreas is either not producing enough insulin, not recognizing the insulin produced or not producing any insulin.  Further understanding the need to monitor the diet for total carbs that are ingested during a meal/day to keep blood sugars stable and within the range the doctor set for him.  Also knowing that he is at increased risk for eye problems (needing yearly eye exam), wound healing problems (need to have frequent foot inspections for non healing sores), rel and cardiac issues.
1	I have Fibromyalgia. I diagnosed myself by putting together all of my symptoms, speaking to a relative that has it, researching it on the internet, and speaking with my doctor.
1	I helped my parents deal with their doctors and medical issues
1	I had to make the decision to not resuscitate my mother after her illness. She had kidney failure and it had affected her mental state. She came out of it, but I knew there would be a continuous decline because of the damage done and the chances of a conscious life were little to none.
-1	Had 3 surgeries and I am a nurse.
1	One example is when I learned I had thyroid problems.  My mother has Hashimoto's disease which I learned is genetic.  I was starting to experience a lot of odd symptoms like dry brittle hair, constipation, dry skin and being cold all the time.  I did some research on the internet and learned that I may have thyroid problems and recalled that my mother had the same problems.  So I went to the doctor and had it checked out and sure enough I had the same disease.  
-1	During my previous physical checkup, I came prepared with many questions, after looking up the info online. When I asked my doctor about these questions, he said I was correct.
1	I went to the doctor with an issue that I had been having.  Because of research I had done on my own time I was able to tell the doctor what I thought was going on.  This lined up with further tests the doctor did and he was able to give me a diagnosis and treatment because of the information provided.
1	My grandfather passed away from cancer years ago. I discussed cancer and the effects of it on the human body with my parents. To this day I try to talk to them about the causes and origins of cancer with them.
1	I have dealt with depression for a lot of my life and it wasn't taken seriously by my family doctor in my teege years.  As a result, I did a lot of research on my own and did what I could to cope.
-1	when I fell off my bike. I knew to apply alcohol and hydrogen peroxide.
1	I was having severe lung pain, saw 3 different doctors who just brushed it off as nothing. I knew it was a real problem so I saw a 4th dr who I demanded to do further testing. That dr filly found the problem after I had to practically beg for further testing.
-1	I had severe migraines years ago.  I noticed that certain foods would trigger them  more so than others. I found that by not eating certain foods, I could reduce them and not have to take daily medication.
1	I have studied different foods and vitamins that are beneficial for my body. At one time I had high cholesterol. I began taking a prescription for my condition but I decided I did not like the long term side effects. So I decided to take my cholesterol down the tural way. I learned a lot along the way.
-1	When I was a teeger my Mother cut her hand while cooking. I immediately found something to make a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and we got her to the emergency right away. The doctor asked who did that and I said it was me. She commended me for taking the right steps to stop the bleeding and cover the wound. This demonstrated that I had knowledge that I had learned in first aid.
1	I honestly cannot think of an experience where I've had the opportunity to demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues, outside of explaining tests or procedures that I have had.
1	I would say every time I get a cold or the flu(rare) that I demonstrate my knowledge of health issues. I actually try to avoid taking any medicines unless its necessary. I think the foods we eat play an important role in our health. So when I do get sick I know that my body needs lots of rest and fluids. I'll take some time off when this happens and I'll get lots of bed rest. I have a juicer and a Vitamix and I'll make lots of fruit and veggie juices to beat the cold.
1	I had a pretty high fever and I knew to go to the doctor so I was able to get treated for strep throat instead of letting it turn into to something else. 
1	I was talking with my parents about issues of diet and nutrition. We were talking about how the medical community has recommended low-fat, high carbohydrate diets for patients with heart problems or at risk for heart attacks for the past 45 years or so, but the evidence that this diet has been effective for reducing heart problems (or for losing weight, for that matter) is poor. They agreed with me, and we further discussed how cutting out sugar and reducing your carbohydrate intake while increasing dietary fat is likely to be the most healthy diet.
1	I am triage/first aid certified, and on one occasion I was able to help someone who was had been in a car accident.  They were in shock and bleeding and had broken their leg.  I was able to help the person out by helping them get out of shock and then by helping them out of their vehicle to safety and making sure there was nothing at else seriously wrong with them until proper medical attention arrived.
1	I was having severe headaches,  not migraine but pretty intense. I looked up probable causes so I could go to the doctor armed with proper questions and description. It was sinusitis and was cleared up pretty quick. 
1	My husband had to have major surgery a few years ago.  He was in the hospital twice for a week each time.  I studied up on all the factors around his illness, and how to help him recover when he got home.  The doctors were very helpful and caring.  
1	This is a tough one.  I have a son and there are times when I have to figure out what is bothering him and how to provide him with relief.  This is one area where my previous experiences and knowledge help me.
1	i had gestatiol diabetes, I had to monitor my blood sugars and eat to keep those levels down, to ensure that my child and I stayed healthy. Both were born without any side effects from the diabetes because I kept myself under control.
1	I had a burning sensation in my esophagus that lasted for days.  I called my (then) doctor.  He prescribed me something over the phone without seeing me and said it would be ready at the drug store. When I went to the drug store, there was nothing there.  I trusted my instincts, did the research on the medicine he was about to prescribe (which I would have had to take consistently for GERD).  I looked up tural altertives to this problem.  I had arugula salads, and 100% pure aloe vera juice, and the problem was gone in a day, forever. Things like this is why I don't trust doctors entirely.
1	Nothing in particular, just life experience.
1	Understanding that high TG was due to my intake of sugar, decreasing my intake of sugar by avoiding soft drinks and switching to black coffee, resulting in a 60% drop in my TG and a lowering of my blood pressure.

1	I've suffered several sports injuries and have been able to recover from them quickly by knowing when to rest, and how to best treat the injury.
1	I suppose having had the flu throughout my childhood has shown me when I should panic, or when it is just general symptoms of the flu.  So this (very) basic knowledge lets me know that I just have the flu.  Altertely if the symptoms were different or more severe that I'm used to, it would be indicative that maybe I should look further into it, and perhaps seek medical professiol assistance.
1	A friend had been given antibiotic eye drops for her son's pink eye. She told me that in the past they had worked well, but this time they were not working as quickly. I asked if her son had recently had a cold, and she said yes. I told her that some pink eye is viral, in which case the eye drops will not help.
1	In cross country I felt tired and my legs were heavy. I knew something was wrong. I went to the doctor and I had iron anemia.
1	I had 2 heart attacks so I learned a lot about cholesterol. I did the diet thing and exercise and it made no difference at all in my numbers. So I take meds. They work. So I learned about hereditary stuff. No much you can do but take your meds.
1	I was hearing a lot of complaints from my brother about how his stomach was bothering him. I convinced him that he should go to a doctor and have it checked out even though he couldn't afford the cost of treatment. He found out that he has a stomach ulcer and now he is doing much better from eating carefully.
-1	looking up things on webmd
1	"I always take care of my fiancee when she gets sick, giving her the right medicines to improve soon. I have no particular experiences to talk about but I have basic knowledge of what to do if you get hurt, if you feel sick, if you feel ""weird"", if you choke or stop breathing."

-1	My mom was a two time cancer patient and I was her caretaker
-1	I was having issues with chronic headaches and had been taking magnesium to try to help. It was not working and I remembered successful magnesium absorption is largely based on amount of Vit D in body. I went to doctor and got prescription vit D and solved the problem.
-1	I worked in a spa sometime in my life and had the ability to take blood pressure.  The mager asked me if I would take his as he wasn't feeling well.  I took it for him and it was high.  We immediately sent him to his doctor.
1	As a child I had sinus and ear infections almost monthly which led me to doctor visits very often. I believe I kept getting them because they over prescribed me antibiotics and lowered their effectiveness. Since I have been on my own I have never been to a doctor once. When I feel like I'm getting sick I rest and take vitamins and minerals. If I do get sick I just rest and get through it.
1	I have an Associates Degree in Occupatiol Therapy and I worked as a therapist for 16 years.  Although I no longer work in the medical field, my years of experience have given me greater knowledge of medical issues than the general public.
-1	I have been diagnosed with a lot of health issues that taught me about them. I used to have a lot of different issues going on, and I was on a lot of medications that I learned a lot about as well. This taught me most of what I know about health and issues.
1	I've taken a few health classes over the years - mainly in high school. Taking tests in those classes helped me to remember and establish the things I've learned through those classes, especially when I had to do research papers for those classes. It was my freshman year of high school, and I didn't save the work I was doing for much longer after the school year was over (my laptop at the time broke down by the time I went into college anyways), so I can't recall it exactly now, but I remember acing the course.
-1	When I was having chest pains, I knew it was because of the birth control pill. Because birth control can cause you to be prone to blood clots, which is a early symptom.
1	I went to the beach with my best friend.  He flatly refused to use sunscreen, despite my advice that he do so.  He ended up with a bad sunburn, while I, who used sunscreen, did not.  
-1	Once I was having problems with murder blood pressure. It would go up more after I checked it. After reading online and seeing my Dr, turns out to be anxiety. So I stopped checking my blood pressure because it was making it worse.
1	I demonstrated knowledge of health issues when I identified symptoms I was feeling as needing medical attention. I don't generally think about or discuss problems, so listening to my body I think shows an intuitive knowledge, even if I don't have the capacity to completely break down the problem's cause or even the solution.
1	I don't have a specific moment showing my knowledge of a health or medical issue.

1	I realized the medication for acne i was on wasnt working so i kept looking for a better solution and foind it eventually with help of a doctor.
1	I used to work for a company that made glucometers doing customer service. So I have no medical training or expertise, but I often talked to people with diabetes and they would tell me a lot about their lives. I had a family member with no insurance who was telling me that she was having some symptoms that she thought might be diabetes. I immediately went and bought her a glucometer, and her blood sugar was way above normal. I recommended that she go to the hospital emergency room because I knew that level would be a huge deal, even for someone diagnosed with diabetes. 
-1	Persolly my many health issues. As well as being a ER Unit Secretary in my younger days. Plus I like medical stuff to an extent.
-1	I had a friend who suffered from depression. I told him to fix his diet and remove meat. Few months later, he started feeling normal.

1	Researching a diet that would eble me to lose weight, lower my blood sugar ( I was pre-diabetic) and lower my triglycerides significantly.  Being able to decide on a ketogenic diet after careful research demonstrated my knowledge of health issues.

1	A few years ago I sustained an energy after doing a workout that involved weightlifting. Based on the pain that I was experiencing and the sorts of movements that aggravated the pain, I was able to correctly deduce that the pain was caused by tendonitis. I went to a physical therapist and he concluded that my hypothesis was correct.
1	My niece was walking barefoot in our yard and stepped on a rusty il. I told her she would need a tetanus show, so I drove her to the local clinic.

1	I am currently pregnt, so I have been doing a lot of research online about possible things that could affect my pregncy and make it more complicated. One thing is high blood pressure and how it is linked to pre-eclampsia. I read about how if you have high blood pressure then they will likely do a urine test to see if there is protein in it, which is a sign of pre-eclampsia. I can have high blood pressure sometimes, so it was no surprise to me when the midwife ordered a urine test to see if there was protein present. 
1	I was told to take a certain prescription for a condition, I was able to tell what I was supposed to take and how it would affect my persol health. 
1	I have had a benign heart condition since 2009, I have dealt with many doctors and specialists since. It was eventually decided my condition was not life threatening and benign and nothing to worry about.  I have become very knowledgeable in medical terminology.

-1	My dad had many heart attacks before he died.  I learned to recognize the signs that he was having a heart attack, early in life.  I then went and took First Aid to make sure I'd be able to help if we were every out together and he needed help.  Well, he ended up having a heart attack (his last major one) in the car with me, my mom, my husband and daughter.  I watched his behavior change and when I saw what was happening, I reached forward in the car and pushed the stick shift to neutral.  I then ran out of the car to the closest store and screamed for them to call 911 for an ambulance because my dad was having a massive heart attack.  I then got back to the car, tried to get his arms raised and undid his tie.  He couldn't respond and was having major difficulty breathing and I made sure he hadn't swallowed his tongue and gave him mouth to mouth until the ambulance came.  He did die later on that night despite everything that was attempted to save him. 
-1	I started to get a constant tickle in my throat and I made an appointment because I knew that something was coming...I thought it was bronchitis, but it was strep throat.
1	I'm a recovering alcoholic, and I've been sober for a significant period of time. At one point, a doctor wanted to give me a prescription for a benzodiazepine. Because I'm aware of how similar benzodiazepines are to alcohol, I refused the prescription, for I felt it was too risky.
1	I was diagnosed with kidney stones 25 years ago. I can now recognize when a kidney stone attack is coming on by paying attention to the symptoms my body gives such as blood in the urine and change of stools.
-1	I don't really have any persol experiences other when my children were sick. I gut used gut gut feelings about when to call the doctor.
1	When my father was going through the process of being diagnosed with alzheimer's disease, I had to attend every doctor's appointment with him and my mother because they couldn't understand a lot the information they were getting.

My parents also relied on me to help them make the decisions regarding my father's care.
-1	I was shown ultrasound images of my lower back due to chronic lower back pain, was given options regarding addressing the back pain and/or it's symptoms and I ultimately chose micro back surgery.
1	I haven't had many experiences that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. The closest I've probably come to having an experience like that is that when someone I know talks about a medical condition, I usually know what it is already and they don't need to explain. I also have some basic first aid knowledge if that counts, and I've used it a couple of times during my life.
-1	I have a best friend whose son has epilepsy. I have been through the ins and outs with her of this disease. From his earliest fits I have educated myself on the topic to help my friend. It has taught me considerably about medicine in general.
1	Twice in my life, my doctors have put me on medications that were bad for me.  One, I was trying to get pregnt and she told me Accupril would be safe for that.  I had asked her at least a dozen times.  I found out that was not true and stopped the meds and a month later got pregnt. The other time I was given lisinopril and told it would protect my kidneys.  My kidney function basically tanked over the next 9 months going from 99% to 43%. I did some research and found out other people were experiencing the same thing.  I stopped the drug on my own again and in 6 months my rel function was back up to 80%.
1	I guess this survey. And my knowledge is awful because I had to guess on the last two questions.
1	The other day my kid passed out and we took her to the ER. They were telling us it could possibly be a seizure which I clearly knew that she had just fainted. Thank goodness it was not a seizure.
1	When I had appendicitis, I was able to recognize possible symptoms and get myself to the hospital before it burst.
1	When I was at college, I began having severe symptoms of a UTI. However, I was not able to see a doctor regularly. I started drinking lots of fluids and cranberry juice and treating myself for a UTI before I was able to go into the doctor. When I went in she confirmed my assumptions and said that my proactivity in the situation prevented the infection from worsening and spreading up into my kidneys.
1	One time I was prescribed medicine for an infection. The medicine didn't work, so the doctor prescribed a different medicine. When I picked up the second medicine, I asked the pharmacist if it had any of the restrictions as the first medicine, such as what foods I should avoid and when would be the best time to consume it. 
-1	work experience
1	I was never stupid enough to try to evaluate myself. I always let the doctor diagnose me even if I thought I knew what was wrong with me.

1	Every time I receive a new medication I need to understand medical issues. When I listen to the doctor describe a condition or how a medicine works, I need to understand medical issues. 
1	When properly advising a family member to use a particular medicine. They soon began to feel better. 
1	I had a previous knee injury and learned a lot about how to help it heal and what was actually wrong with it. A few months ago, my boss had the same injury. I was able to help give him tips on how to help it heal and explain to him what was actually wrong in easier terms than his doctor had.
1	Growing up I spent a lot of time visiting my grandfather in hospitals and my grandmother was a pharmacist. I feel that by being around them I picked up a lot of medical knowledge by osmosis.
1	I had a hard time getting pregnt so I researched a lot about fertility issues and medical treatments, also learning ways to live healthier to help promote fertility. 
-1	Self-diagnoses of sicknesses. Knowing when to go to the doctor. Not being dead.
1	I know for a fact any time I pee and it is painful I have a UTI. Its something I have gotten many times before and it still happens once in a while no matter how much a try to follow all the rules for not getting one.
-1	If a family member or myself have a simple medical issue they usually ask me what to do, and I almost always can help out or at least stop them from worrying. For example, my father in law had a high blood sugar reading and I helped him get it down and advised him to get tested for diabetes
1	When playing hockey there have been times when I knew if an injury was serious or not.   It comes with age and experience and not just levels of pain.   When you learn your body you can tell when something is really not right or is just a soreness that will go away.
1	I think one experience was when I decided to stop eating meat. I always felt a bit sty before, so I decided to try cutting out different things to see if anything helped. I ended up cutting out meat and started eating healthier, and felt much better overall.
1	"I've been dealing with clinical depression for over 12 years. During that time I've done significant ""reading up"" on anti-depressants (been on 6) and into CBT. In fact, I just started CBT on-line [ MooyGym ]because I live 60 miles from my doctor. And I've learned a *lot* about how the brain works (or doesn't)."
1	One day in the shower, I felt a lump in my breast.  I knew that my mother and grandmother had cystic breasts and that a cyst feels round and soft compared to cancer which can feel more irregular and hard.  Although I made an appointment to go see my doctor and they ended up giving me an ultrasound and mammogram, I wasn't very concerned because I knew the likelihood that this was cancer wasn't a lot because of the things I knew.
1	I had for years digestive issues and a sour taste in my mouth in the mornings. I also seemed to have a slight cough. I pretty much knew it was GERD, but held off for years going to the doctor for it. When it got unmageable and filly went through the tests, I was correct in my thinking.
1	After experiencing the symptoms of both cold and flu over the years, I know what to look for and how to treat it/if I should see a doctor.  Also, after having numerous pap smears and mammograms I know what the results mean after hearing it some many times. 
1	"I have been a chronic opiate user for about 16 years. I have Hepatitis C, most likely as a result from using my same needle repeatedly when new ones were not available. I was blessed to be able to get to go to a doctor that prescribed me Suboxone (new medication treatment for heroin addiction) and because I did a lot of research on treatments for my particular issue, I knew to alert the doctor that I did have Hep C because the ""blocking agent"" in the Suboxone (keeps you from being able to experience euphoria from opiates besides the buprenorphine in the Suboxone), the loxone, has reportedly effected liver function in some people. Now the doctor is going to watch my blood labs to see whether or not I can stay on the current medicine or if I need to switch to a similar version of the drug that does not have the loxone in it."
1	i can usually self diagnose through the internet so when i go in (i need to be damn near dead or something is broken to go in) i tell the doctor so here's what i have (typically strep) he agrees prescribes the z-pac and away i go
1	I used my medical knowledge when it I had to decide a treatment plan for my child when he was diagnosed with bronchitis. I made sure the medication prescribed did not have side effects and they were absolutely necessary. 
1	I just research stuff on medical websites, and talk to my doctors. I've had a couple minor issues in my life where I've been pretty back to back with doctors, so besides all of that, nothing really.
1	I have taken numerous health related college courses and am well versed in how to find and obatian medical information and how to research medical jourls. I had a close relative that was in the hospital after a very bad accident and I was able to research their condition and gain the knowledge to help them make informed medical decisions as part of their recovery.  
1	Signs of infection in a wound. I had an ingrown hair that got infected. The area got red and swollen and pus started to build up under the skin. It took a while for the wound to heal after it was excised due to build up. So I learnt about how to know when something is infected and signs and symptoms associated with it.
-1	Reading through document about bell's palsy and knowing what to expect because a relative had experienced it.
1	A couple of months ago, I started a keto diet. This diet is similar to the Atkins diet. The major difference is you add more fats and healthy oils. After a week or two of no sugar and lows carbs, you're body will go into Ketoisis. This uses stored fat instead of carbs for energy.
1	I was speaking with someone at my church, who mentioned that their son had scoliosis. I asked her how severe it was; what the degree of the curvature was. She was surprised that I was that knowledgeable about it, and I told her that my son had it as well so I knew about it.
-1	I remember a friend telling me he suffered from very strong headaches that made him sensitive to light and sometimes sounds. He complained that the pain was a pulsing one. You could always describe it as throbbing. I mentioned to him that it sounded like a migraine headache, something I suffer from. I told him to see his doctor to make sure, but it sounded like a migraine to me. Turns out that was what it exactly was.  
-1	When my husband was sick, he would not go to the doctor or hospital-I knew he was close to dying and called an ambulance, he had septic shock and they had to warm his blood with a plastic topping he was that close to death.
1	About 10 years ago I self-diagnosed my Autism Spectrum Disorder. I was filly professiolly diagnosed about 8 years later. During that time I learned more than the doctors who refused to listen to my concerns.
1	I've worked as a life and health insurance agent in the past. Often I would help older people with medicare supplement plans. Going through the various plans, overages, deductibles, etc., took a fair amount of knowledge. Drug pricing, altertives and availability. Hospital costs, referral procedures. I would often help them to understand medical terminology.
1	I had a two day stay at the hospital. I was treated for low sodium,because of a drug interaction. I had to answer a lot of questions and i learned a lot.
1	My mother was diagnosed as pre-diabetic and had blood pressure around 200. She was put on meds that turned her into a zombie, but necessarily to save her life. I read up on her medication and found that over long periods of it could have negative effects on the kidneys and had her go back in to see about a different medication, they did tests and found high amounts of protein in her urine because of the medication and was at high risk of kidney damage.
1	I tore my ACL, and had to decide if I would have surgery to replace it or not, and if so, what I would use to replace it. After reviewing the information, I decided to have the surgery, and to use a cadaver part to fix it.
1	My grandmother had heart surgery and she developed a staff infection. They also found pre-cancer cells in her throat at the same time. My family heard cancer and freaked out. I was more concerned with the infection because she was old and pre-cancer cells could take decades to actually turn into cancer. The doctor said i was right and calmed my family the immediate concern was the infection and the heart.   
-1	The research I did on my own issues and the books I read. I looked at WebMD, Wikipedia (even though it's not secure), and other sites. I even took an atomy course where we picked a disease relevant to the chapter and wrote a short discussion board post about it.
1	I was the caregiver and advocate for my father who was dying of lung cancer. I dealt with his doctors and the hospice nurses daily for many months.
1	On one of my doctor's visit, the appointment had to end early because of an emergency. The doctor didn't have enough time to explain to me in person all the questions I had, so he gave me a small booklet instead. I had no problem understanding the material without any help from healthcare professiols.
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I was younger I got a rare disease that made me really sick. During this time I was forced to start learning and understanding different medicine and side effects. 
1	I have learned that the food you eat and the exercise you do are very important to your health. It keeps your body strong and your stress level low. 
1	I had a liver disease issue. I looked up information on the matter. I became knowledgeable. I discussed the matter with my doctor in an informed manner.
1	I recently took a medication that had an effect on my dental health. I had to have a tooth extraction, but learned that the drug could have negative consequences. So I informed the dentist about it, and I was more closely monitored during and after the procedure.
1	I have self treated illnesses that most people believe you need to go to the doctor for. 
-1	i just had to listen to doctors and do research on my own
1	"I'm not really sure. I had cancer twice so I guess as I was doing chemo I understood how all this stuff was supposed to work. I knew Everytime I went to the hospital what the routine was, and knew everywhere I needed to go. I'm not sure I really ""demonstrated"" my knowledge but this is the only thing I can think of."
1	I was having issues sleeping. And after some research i found out I was snoring in my sleep and had sleep apnea.
1	My mom went to the ER thinking that she was having a heart attack or at the very least heart problems.  I accompanied her to the hospital although I told her her symptoms were not necessarily heart related and that she really just needed to relax and work on stress reduction.  The doctors agreed with me but went ahead and performed heart stress test.  There was nothing found.
1	I've taken a few atomy classes in college. Besides that, I don't have too much experience.  
1	I honestly cannot think of such an experience.
1	I have asthma. When I was about 15 someone explained that my difficulty breathing was due to too much air in my lungs, not as it seemed, too little. I used this information to train myself to breathe in more shallowly and breathe out more completely. It seems to help when it gets bad.
1	I developed a keloid scar and was going to a dermatologist to get rid of it.  On the first visit she was attempting to describe how it developed in layman terms and I responded by using the medical terminology.  She laughed and said oh you are smarter than you look.
-1	I fell down a flight of stairs.  My son insited I broke my ankle but I assured him I probably had a hair line fracture.  The bone had not come through and I was somewhat able to walk on it.
-1	Like I wrote before... my wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer and we both fought that diseases....  I was on a phone call with all kind of specialists, doctors and technicians...  we got some more experience than we wanted. 
1	"A few weeks ago, my brother hit his head at work. He'd had several mild concussions as a child and pretty much self-diagnosed himself as having another one this time. (Yes, that's wildly irresponsible. Yes, he should have gone to the doctor. You know what, tell it to fucking Nikki Haley because it's her fault he's not insured.) He did some research about concussion and painkillers and said he needed to take something other than Excedrin, preferably Tylenol. He was pretty upset because we didn't have any Tylenol and his head hurt. So I realized that often, different me brands of the same medicine will have similar mes, and another painkiller that ended in ""ol"" might have the same active ingredient as Tylenol. I looked up the active ingredients online and checked the bottle to make sure, and then gave him a Midol from my supply. So most of the medical knowledge in that scerio came from him, but I was the one who realized that Midol would probably help and did the research to verify it."
-1	I had to go get a mammogram so I researched online about it and learned stuff.
1	Someone had fallen at my place of work and was a pale yellow color and also was clutching his chest. I called 911 and had the people that were already on the floor with him trying to see if he's okay, to prop his head up and leave him still until emergency services arrived.
1	When I had an abnormal papsmear, I knew it was possible that it was a false positive. I went through the extra testing and listened to everything the doctor told me and understood thoroughly the process.
-1	When my mother in law got sick with cancer she needed alot of support.  Since having going through it with my mom, I was able to tell her some of the things that she would possibly experience with chemo.  We were able to go to the store to get some things to make her comfortable throughout the process.
1	In high school I had severe headaches for weeks and missed school for two weeks straight, after seeing multiple doctors I filly understood what was going on in my body and I learned that I had Mitral Valve Prolapse. 
1	I guess any atomy exam I've taken would fit this since those literally involved demonstrating medical knowledge, but outside of school I guess the most fitting thing I can think of was when a friend of mine wasn't feeling well and wasn't sure his symptoms meant. I sussed out based on what he was experiencing that it was probably a UTI that was progressing towards the bladder and kidneys, and recommended he see a doctor immediately. It was indeed a bladder infection, and he was able to get effective treatment. I'm glad that my knowledge of that particular health condition helped, as he might not have sought treatment right away otherwise.
-1	I was having inflammation in my sweat glands and I researched what my symptoms were and I found out I actually had a skin disease and my doctor ended up diagnosing me with what i had found
1	My boyfriend has MS and during the time of his diagnosis I spent a lot of time doing research in order to to keep up with doctors when discussing his medical options, as well as on medications that were mentioned.
1	I've lead a very healthy life however I've had 2 brothers who both passed from cancer. My oldest brother died first and I was the only relative to be there for him. Because of that, when my middle brother passed I had a working knowledge of questions to ask the attending physicians and what to expect when the time actually came.
1	I was a C a few years ago.  I also took pharmacology in order to get in to nursing school. I never entered nursing school, although I was admitted.
1	For a good portion of 2015, I was sick. I had a fever, cold, body aches, etc. at least twice a month. Last year, I started eating about five cloves of raw garlic every day. It's a killer on my breath, but I haven't been sick since.
1	I have some experience dealing with IBS which hasn't responded that well to conventiol treatment. I have been able to learn about ways to mitigate it without having to take drugs.
1	I was sick with flu and stuck on work/travel.  I filly insisted home-time so I could rest, eat fruit, granola, yogurt, and take vitamin C.  I was better in less than a day after being sick for a week.
-1	I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol so I am familiar with medical terms and how they affect my life. I was a corrections officer in the infirmary and had several cases that I was able to help because of recognizing certain symptoms.  
1	I have asthma so that has made me more aware of my health choices and medical issues. 
1	I have  had issues with my teeth. due to that i have some knowlage or antibiots and pain killers. 
1	One time I was talking with a co-worker and she was talking about her nephew that had been born with heart defects.  I know a lot about congenital heart defects because my daughter has that also.
1	At one point in my life i was constantly sore and fatigued. No matter how much sleep i had i would always be tired and had poor recovery from excercise. After researching and cutting out all forms of sugar, processed foods, and dairy and started to eat a plant based diet, My health became amazing. I looked and felt amazing. I never even imagined it was possible to feel so good and have so much energy
-1	I recently went through surgery to remove some abnormal cells off of my cervix and this opened my eyes to better women's health.
1	I do not really know what this means. I have looked up symptoms of my SO and convinced her to filly go to the doctor.
-1	I had to take an MRI on my knees to look for problems. The nurse was trying to explain to me how it worked but I already knew how because I had read about them. 
-1	When I went to the doctor and I understood what he was saying without Leigh man's terms 
1	I once was able to explain to my friend some of the details of childbirth. This only sticks out in my mind because they had no idea about the process at all. I also had a decent amount of details about the process. 
1	
1	My mother is 93 years old and has dementia and my husband and myself are her caregivers. We monitor and take care of her health including her type II diabetes and blood pressure. She has had various health issues including hospitalization due to falls and from all this experience we have learned much on how to cope with and mage her health and safety as well as being aware of complications and things to monitor
1	When I needed emergency surgery after a twisted intestine due to gastric bypass I was able to follow along with what tests and procedure information my doctor was going to do and perform.
1	My youngest daughter fell and she thought she broke her wrist. It was swollen but not deformed and she was able to move her hand and fingers. I iced it and waited a day and saw no bruising, so I assumed it was sprained and not broken. I guess I could have been wrong, but in this situation I was right. The swelling went down with ice and the pain was gone in a couple days.
-1	When I tried to eat salads
1	My wife burnt her arm on the stove.  I put it under cool water and then applied aloe vera to it and bandages it.
1	Strokes and high blood pressure run in the family. When my mother called and said her right eye vision was blocked like a curtain had been pulled down half way I knew we had to get her to the hospital quickly. She was having a TIA. She had many of them during her last 2 years alive. They usually lasted only minutes.
1	A time that I demonstrated knowledge of health or medical issues in my life was when I was with my friend David. David suffers from diabetes and fainted when we were out walking the streets of shville. I was very aware of his condition and ran into the nearest restaurant and got orange juice. We rushed back to David and gave him the orange juice and some food and he was able to get oriented pretty quickly after that before checking his sugar and insulin levels. 
1	
1	I have given birth 4 times. Each experience was different and I had to know about what I needed to do in each situation. The options open to me for pain relief and how they could affect me and the baby. 
1	A friend of mine was displaying all the symptoms of anxiety but didn't think anything was wrong, that it was just a rough patch she was going through. I helped her and showed her medical stuff that made her go to the doctor and get treatment. She's feeling much better now.
-1	
1	When I birthed my son, I took no preparation courses and I handled the birth well. I understood the progression of labor to delivery and knew what to expect without educating myself otherwise. 
1	having gone to the doctors myself and then going with my family members
-1	"An experience that demonstrated my knowledge was at my friends place. My friend's father complained about swelling on a bruise located on this kneecap. He apparently still believes in old methods of injuries and says that there is bad ""chi"" blocking. He would take a slipper to smack the bruise and this gives him relief. I was really shocked at this thinking and I had to stop him and explained that the swelling is because the vessels are damaged so the blood is clogged in the area which gives the swelling look. His solution should be massaging the area so the blood flows away."
1	I just go to the doctor and have seen people be diagnosed. I know basic stuff
1	I enjoy reading articles on health from many sources. My mother is also a doctor and tends to explain things to me about medical issues. Even if I ask her a general question, she wants to give me much more information than I asked for.
1	I got salmonella poisoning one time, I was very sick for 5 days. I filly took my temperature and it was at 105 degrees. I knew that anything above 104 could be deadly, so I arranged a ride to take me to the emergency room.
1	I had a condition in which my ear produced wax without stop. A friend of mine started having the same problem as me some years later and I was able to help him in solving the problem.
1	I remember a spring where I was constantly congested and had itchy eyes. With the knowledge I had about my symptoms and exterl factors, I guessed I had allergies or hay fever. I felt confident in knowing why my body was like that.
-1	I've had to sanitize and bandage a few of my own wounds that weren't serious enough for stitches.
1	what i typically do to help my hypertension is read a lot of nutritiol labels. i try to keep my sodium intake fairly low (a lot of salt makes me really bloated anyway) and i always look at fat and carb content. this is something i do every time i buy a packaged food that has a label on it. if it doesn't have a label, i look it up on my phone if i am shopping. this helps me be much more knowledgeable and aware of what i am eating.
1	I have taken advanced biology classes in college.  I also read a lot about health issues, so I feel I'm fairly knowledgeable.   
1	One experience that demonstrates my medical knowledge was that I lost about 30 pounds over two years and gained a good amount of healthy lean muscle. Getting fit involved learning about and counting calories, choosing healthy proteins and carbohydrate sources with enough fat, and learning about exercise. Through this learning process, I was able to lose this weight in a healthy way, and improve in my efforts at the gym greatly. 
1	In general, I have little knowledge of health and medical issues. The only thing I can think of to describe is a time in my early twenties when I went on a no-grain diet. I had read about the diet and what it entailed, and while looking back, I think it was a poor choice, I was clearly acting on knowledge (however misguided) of a health topic. 
1	My teachers spent considerable time with me making sure that I understood word problems. While I cannot proclaim to be the best, I can say that I am competent.
1	calling 911 when I had a heart attack
1	My husband is a T1 diabetic, my daughter was born with spi bifida and my grandmother is blind. I have a lot of experience with hospitals, doctors, and their forms.
1	I 'm not sure that I really have one. I am on medications for anxiety and depression. Before they figured out what worked for me, I went through a long list of medications that did not work, so in that sense, I was able to determine what worked for me. 
1	I had bronchitis and was told to take a medication. I took it as instructed and the symptoms went away in about a week. But, I continued to take the rest of the medicine as instructed, despite feeling good.
1	I cut my finger while working in the dirt. I had to keep working, but i knew mi finger would get infected if I did without taking care of it. So I washed it, cleaned it with peroxide, bandaged it then put a glove over my hand. It healed fine and never got infected
1	When I was diagnosed with asthma, I had no idea what it was and it really tested my knowledge.
1	I was able to help my mom choose the correct insulin when she was faced with a choice of switching medicine. I was able to help her read and understand the benefits and side effects of each drug.
1	My friend broke his arm a few years back. I was the only one around so I made a splint out of sweater and some wood. When we got to the ER, the nurse complimented me on my splint.
1	After a mammogram showed an area of question, I knew not to panic right away as there could be different reasons for this. Sure enough, after a follow up, it was shown to just be folded skin.
1	I was sent home from the hospital and told to monitor my intake and outake to check for kidney function.  I measured everything I drank and all urine to determine whether or not to call the doctor.  At one point, my intake was almost twice my outtake.  I called the doctor and was hospitalized because my kidneys were shutting down.
-1	I just have a general knowledge about health and medicine. I do not have any significant expertise, and i have not gone to med school. But when my son scrapes his knee, I clean the wound and put on a band aid. 
-1	Well one occassion where i was having severe headaches everyday for about a week without stopping i knew something was wrong. I went to the doctor and i already was hoping for them to do a head scan to see what was wrong. They showed me i had severe chronic migrane and i needed to start taking a few medications . I totally understood everything when it comes to my health and how much i know my body
1	It's less a specific experience and more a general one; about ten years ago I generally felt awful: constant aches and pains, low energy, difficulty breathing, bad mood, poor concentration, frequently sick with colds and sinus infections. It didn't take a lot of knowledge to know what was wrong - I was out of shape, had a poor diet, smoked cigarettes and drank alcohol. I set out and learned a lot about nutrition and exercise, I quit smoking and drinking, and I put a plan in place to gradually change my lifestyle in a way that was sustaible. Today I'm in perfect health, happy, energetic, focused, and haven't so much as had a sniffle in over two years.
1	A couple of years ago, I began to feel extremely anxious. This is a problem because it told me my anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication was no longer doing its job. My doctor chose to make no adjustments. I knew, from being told by several different therapists, that eventually mental health medications can either stop working or bring your brain chemistry up to a level where it's no longer needed. That I might need off the medication or to be switched to a different one. My doc seemed uware of this. When I couldn't get the help I needed, I changed docs.
1	I was a witnes of a car accident,two weeks ago. I stopped to look after the drivers and there were no bad injuries at first look.One of them was limping and complained about some pain in his leg.I told him to sit down ot lie down,while we were waiting for the ambulance.
1	I have two elderly parents who live part time in Florida, where I live, and I am usually called upon to help them if there are any serious health issues that come up as the rest of my family lives up north. I have more than once had to spend time in the hospital as the only receiver of their health info for the family.
1	My wife had a tooth pulled and it would not stop bleeding. I told her to put a tea bag pver it and that would help stop the bleeding.
1	When I was diagnosed with Trigemil Neuralgia, my neurologist was surprised to find that I actually knew what that was, and what the treatments for it were.  I had done some research prior to going in to see what could have been causing such terrible pain.  My research came up with the TN diagnosis.  However, I wanted a professiol's opinion before deciding with any certainty that TN was indeed what I had, or requesting treatment for it.
1	When dealing with my children I have to fill out all there medical forms and deal with there illnesses or injuries.   I would say just having children you learn a lot by raising them about what is severe and not.  You know when the doctor needs to be called or visited.
-1	When I was twelve years old, a drunk driver hit the car my mother was driving while I was in the backseat. I have very few memories of the accident, but I do faintly recall a serious but calming face as I was gently lifted out of the car. The paramedic held my hand as we traveled to the hospital. I was in the hospital for several weeks and that same paramedic came to visit me almost every day. During my stay, I also got to know the various doctors and nurses in the hospital on a persol level. I remember feeling anxiety about my condition, but not sadness or even fear. It seemed to me that those around me, particularly my family, were more fearful of what might happen to me than I was. I donât believe it was innocence or ignorance, but rather a trust in the abilities of my doctors
1	I can't say there has been an experience in my life that would demonstrate medical knowledge. 
1	A few months ago my son had a sinus infection. After trying traditiol over the counter options we had little result and made a doctors appointment so that we could get an antibiotic. The doctor confirmed that it was a good idea to try to clear it up without antibiotics first, but that he would most likely need them at this point.
1	I guess I would return to my earlier statement in that I am a mother who spent a lot of time dealing with everyone's health issues in my family. I have also taken care of helping my parents because they are aging and get confused. I wouldn't say that I feel completely comfortable with everything related to health decisions, but if I have questions, I ask and I also do a lot of research before I make decisions. I have had to do additiol testing in the past for health issues, and I felt comfortable with my choices after I dug deeply into the issues myself. Ultimately I am the one who wants to decide what happens to me, either good or bad.
-1	i was diagnosed with high colestoral, I was given Lipitor and took the drug as proscribed.  On the next vist to the doctor my colestoral was within acceptable limits
-1	I do not have much medical knowledge.
1	Having gone to my first doctor who approved me for operation on my septum, felt the need to explain things to me about the process as well in simplistic terms and when I explained to him that I already knew it made him angry and then later refused to perform the operation on me by constantly pushing me back until I had to change medical carriers and could no longer get him to perform the surgery.
-1	I was able to detemine if some one has a cold has opposed to an allergy, by the type of symptoms and the pollen count at the time.
1	I was discovered to have high blood pressure a few years ago.  I started taking medication and my BP was lower but I felt terrible.  No energy at all.  So I went back to the doctor and described my symptoms so he put me on a different pill and now I'm doing fine.  I guess that demonstrates my understanding of making sure I get the right medication for me.
1	My father is a doctor and my mother is a nurse. I'm not the best with math however. 
1	A friend of mine actually recently had a mammogram that came out positive. I told her there was a good chance that it was a false positive and might just be a cyst or something. It did in fact turn out to be a false positive.
1	I got bit by a tick and contracted Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever so I went and looked it up and learned as much as I could about it and even offered information to my own doctor.
1	When reading the paperwork on a new medication, I discovered that it was Not advised in someone with my other conditions. Called and told the doctor.
1	A FEW MONTHS AGO MY DAUGHTER HAD A SORE THROAT, FEVER, AND HAD TROUBLE SWALLOWING. BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN A FEW INSTANCES OF STREP THROAT IN HER SCHOOL, I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SHE DID TOO. I KEPT HER OUT OF SCHOOL, MADE HER REST AND DRINK A LOT, AND I TOOK HER TO THE DOCTOR. MY GUESS WAS CONFIRMED, AND AN ANTIBIOTIC WAS PRESCRIBED.. 
1	I was diagnosed with a chronic disease a few years ago. I searched a lot of medical information and knowledge online, and consulted with many peoples about this disease. Now, i am taking some medicines to control this disease. I could adjust my medicines based on the self-testing results now. 
1	Every time I go to my doctor I have long conversations about health and medical issues. Sometimes I even remind him of new ways of doing certain procedures. For example, a few years ago I went in to get tested for STD's. I did not have any symptoms but anytime I am sexually active I get tested. Before the test was given I reminded my doctor that bacterial STD's can now be tested through urine and the old invasive procedure was no longer necessary.
1	I honestly only think of times my children were sick, just knowing from experience what was a serious symptom and what most likely was not.
1	I have high cholesterol that I mage with diet, exercise and homeopathic remedy Polycosil. I understand that my LDL is very good, so that helps my HDL even though it is over 200. I get annual blood tests and track my HDL and LDL and compare it to weight. My doctor and I also discuss these results. As long as my LDL stays high, I do not need to start taking a statin to reduce my cholesterol.
-1	Mostly contra indications of my husband's many meds, how to maintain a dyalysis patient, deal with doctors and ask questions that got my husband the right treatment. Also stopped an amputation of Grandmother's leg by indicating the need for a Doppler as she had phlebitis. Only her toe was then amputated.
1	"At one point, I was reading on the appearance of ""floaters"" in one's field of vision out of curiosity since I experienced them very irregularly.  Within a few months, my mom complained to me that she was seeing them very frequently, and I tried to explain to her the potential causes for them, including retil tearing.  Because of this, she went to the doctor and was told she had almost experienced a severe reti tear in one of her eyes."

Im SO glad he listened to me :( spent $300 at the ER instead of waiting for the morning to see his regualr physician and co pay of $30.

My regular doctor and my midwife both agreed with me."
1	I do not know how to answer this as I feel all my experiences lead me to this knowledge of health or medical issues as I try to study and learn as much as possible. This question is either unclear or I just am not understanding it. I can only reiterate: no one experience demonstrated my knowledge. I try to make myself knowledgeable whenever I have a medical issues by studying and inquiring.

I was thought I knew the causes so I asked them if they were running everyday and if they continued running after pulling the muscle. When they answered yes on both counts I explained that they needed to add rest days to their routine and that the hip pain was the result of the body making unconscious corrections in running style due to the pulled muscle. I recommended they take a week off to heal up and some NSAIDs to keep swelling down. The recommendations were effective.

1	I woorked in a hospital as a night shift computer operator. Part of my function was to print the bills. What an eye opener as to the horrible cost of medical care in the US. As recently as today I am reminded of the cost of healthcare in the US with ads about bankruptcy due to medical bills and how people have to hock eveyrthing to pay off their medical bills. What a mess!

1	During the Ebola crisis I had a lot of coworkers freaking out over getting Ebola. I had to tell them constantly that there was hardly any chance that they or anybody they knew would get it. Very hard to contract and even if it was in america the people would be quarantined. At the end of the whole thing nobody died.
1	I was given a course of antibiotics to take for 20 days.  Even though I felt better after 3 days I continued taking the medication because I knew the bacteria may still be present even though I was no longer feeling the symptoms and stopping early could increase the chances of creating a drug resistant form of the bacteria.
-1	My wife has MS and I go with her to every appointment.  The doctor was impressed that I knew so much about the disease and that we were already doing some of the exercises.  She gave us some more things to try to help with mobility.  This disease has a lot of twists and turns.  Everyday is something new to learn about.
1	There haven't really been any experiences like that. I don't want to make anything up. I've been to a doctor like 3 times ever and I never had to do anything to demonstrate my knowledge.
1	When my dog was sick I figure out that we was either allergic or was having a reaction to certain kinds of food. He had symptoms similar to allergies. 
-1	I went to a doctor because i had a lump at my side. it was the size of a marble and it was black in color compare to my lighter carmel complexion. it was painful to touch and i could not lay down on that side of my body.  The doctor told me it was just fat tissue when she felt it and said she could do minor surgery and remove it by cutting it out. I told her i'll decide if to do surgery to remove it. I did my own research online based on signs and symptoms and the swelling turned out to be a acne cyst. I look up treatment for cyst and treat the problem myself. the pain disappeared and the swelling went down flat.

1	I began experiencing severe coldness in my fingers of my left hand, to the point where the digits turned blue and dark purple (even when I was indoors at 65 degrees). This progressed to affect my nose, left foot toes, and sometimes my nipples, with severe episodes causing my fingerils to develop waves and my fingers to develop painful lesions that scarred. I researched and figured out that I have Rayud's syndrome and that constriction in my blood vessels was likely due to stress, cold temperatures, etc. Through diet and exercise, I have reduced the number of episodes that I have. 
-1	I kept having very severe reactions after eating certain types of food or consuming certain drinks. It was very painful, like being punched in the stomach from the inside. I suspected it had to do with my being sensitive to the acid content of what I had and it could be acid reflux. I went to my doctor and sure enough, my suspicions were correct. 
1	I am overweight and I am always told that I probably have diabetes before they ever test me. They always just assume and I tell them every time that I don't. I do not have any of the common symptoms of diabetes besides the fact that I am overweight. In the end they are always shocked that I turn out to be right and that diabetes is not the problem.
1	Years ago I had problems with my stomach. Based on the symptoms, I was pretty sure that I knew what the problem was. After double checking online, I was even more sure, so I went to the doctor. It turns out that I was right and the doctor let me know that it was good that I came in when I did, so he was able to help me.
1	When I spilled ravioli on my arm, I was able to identify the burn as a second-degree burn and I knew that I shouldn't put a cotton bandage directly on the burn because that could result in harm to my skin. I ran my arm under cool water, took ibuprofen, applied an antibiotic cream, and bandaged the burn loosely to prevent infection.
-1	When I was 18 I was told I might have cervical cancer. When I when to see my obgyn to get tested I did my research so as he was going through the orocudur I was able to ask more in depth questions
1	I was doing some cleaning and lifting heavy objects when I felt something in my stomach and groin area, I thought maybe I pulled a muscle, but then a bit later I noticed a bulge in my groin. I did some research online and found out that it was most likely an inguil hernia. I went to my doctor and he confirmed my suspicions. 
1	I was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago. I took a diabetes education class at the local hospital and did lots of research on my own about diabetes. With this knowledge, I was able to learn steps I can take and things I can change about my lifestyle to help me mage the diabetes. Through carrying out these changes I lowered my A1C considerably and brought it back into the normal change. It has stayed there and my blood sugar levels have been consistently in the normal range. This is partially a result of the medication I now take but also a result of eating a much better diet and exercising more, which I learned how to do through my research. 
-1	I haven't
-1	I am the only one in my household who have knowledge of health issue i have to take care my 11 years daughter, father and mother in law who have parkinson's, blood pressure, diabeties and prostate. alwyas i ahve to go doctors for them to consult. their medication etc.
1	My then-12-year-old daughter ate a brownie and broke out in hives & started wheezing. I gave her some Benedryl, and took her to the emergancy room immediately.  Turns out, my daughter had developed an allergy to tree-nuts. My husband is deathly allergic to eggs, so I had an idea of what a food-allergy reaction looked like & how serious it COULD be. I'm also aware that allergies can develop or fade away at any age, or stay the same for life.
1	i honestly dont know what to put here, i dont feel ive ever shown something like this in a significant way
1	My child had been ill with a fever, random usea and fatigue. After the fever and usea had passed, he was still extremely fatigued and had swollen glands.

1	I have been able to diagnose and override a doctor when my brother was on the clinic, and It turned out that I was right. 
1	I haven't had many situations in which I needed to be able to demonstrate knowledge if medical issues. Both of my parents passed away from cancer and I did gain some knowledge of that process at that time. 
1	I'm not sure I can think of one. My cat was diabetic  so I had to give him insulin and when he went into kidney failure I gave him fluids so I understand the technical process but I don't feel I have a proper understanding of the actual disease.
1	I sometimes discuss my friend's medical condition with them. I will pass along information I have confirmed with my doctor.
1	
1	I felt that I was going to faint after I had spent a long time standing up in a particularly hot office. I had had similar experiences  before, and had researched the subject of the vasovagal response and the best action to take in that situation. I quickly got to the ground, elevated my legs, and tensed my leg muscles as I had researched.  As a result, I didn't faint and was able to stand up again and resume work shortly afterwards.
-1	The most important experience was when I took my state board exams for my PTA license. I had to be well versed in medical terminology as well as diseases and the causes and treatment for each one. Most important was knowing what muscle controls what part of the body. 
-1	I worked as a medical transcriptionist in the radiology department at my local hospital. I had to type doctor's dictations regarding patient x-rays, MRI's, CT scans, and ultrasounds. I learned about a lot of health and medical issues from typing these reports, such as broken bones, spine or joint conditions, and many types of cancer.
-1	When I had my first heart attack I was in really bad shape. When I got out I was given all of these different types of exercises to follow every day in order to keep me in tact with my health.  It was difficult to keep up with. I had to get family to help me out with my schedule.  I learned so much during this trial about things I didnt even know about my own body and health. 
1	The second time that I got pregnt I felt as though I had a great knowledge of the process. This is the only medical issue that I am very familiar with. Now that I have friends who are pregnt I get to show my knowledge.

1	It really breaks down to being able to do math cause so much of it is based on a percentages. 
1	I have not had many experiences in my life to help my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am studying to become a nurse, so I have taking a couple of Atomy and Physiology courses that have helped a bit. My grandmother is also a nurse, and I am sure just talking to her has had a little bit of an effect on my understanding.
-1	My children had fevers reading over 100. I knew this was no cause for concern because infant temperatures often read higher and to watch their behavior and stools instead for any inconsistencies.
1	A couple of years ago, I had some kind of a bump on my upper leg. It kind of freaked me out, not knowing what it was and how it developed. But instead of worrying too much about it and running to the doctor I just watched it to see if it began to hurt or get bigger. I didn't want to scare myself or my family too much about it so I just waited. I also didn't look anything up online, knowing that that would only make me much more anxious and scared. Eventually, it went away, as I believe it was just from stress or something.
-1	Once I had a tiny growth on my thyroid. One doctor (who was slash for cash happy) wanted to rip it out. In light of the fact that I'm a singer, I instead elected to monitor it once a year. There has been no change in the 6 years I have been monitoring it. 
1	Family members with cancer, and a mother with a very odd medical history, mostly unexplained.
1	When I eat and want to figure out how many calories I ate I can calculate that easily .

-1	I was diagnosed late in life with beta thalassemia minor; up until that time I had always been considered anemic but no one ever considered the cause.  With my current doctor he asks for blood tests every 6 months.  Every time he discusses the results with me he gets concerned about the anemia.  Every single time I have to remind him that it is the thalassemia minor which is NOT treatable, especially not with iron supplements.
-1	I guess when I was talking to my husband about diabetes. My father has it, so I was able to tell him about my dad's condition with an above basic level of understanding.

-1	In my studies of my own ailments such as blood pressure
1	I came down with flu-like symptoms but experienced headaches and stiffness in my neck that are symptoms of a more serious ailment: meningitis. I quickly sought the assistance of a health practitioner that commended me for recognizing the dangers and not trying to remedy the situation myself.
1	Having children made me a pseudo expert in diagnosing health issues and adding to my health knowledge. Many times, my children would exhibit symptoms and if they appear benign enough I would go online to check symtoms to self diagnose. While doing that, I've read up and gained a lto of knowledge on many different illnesses and its treatments. 
1	My fiance had 3 strokes in 3 weeks in March of 2017. Fortutely, I was aware of the warning signs, and got her help before things got too out of hand. I've also helped her with her other medical issues, so I know what meds to go for when she has a problem.
1	This is kind of a hard question to answer. I have never had any serious medical issues persolly. I have extensive knowledge of many issues my father had prior to his death. He was a diabetic, along with the majority of his siblings and mother. I know that there could be a high probability that I could acquire diabetes myself if I don't take care of my body by watching what I eat and exercising  regularly.
-1	I would get tested with how these things are done and how people were doing and making sure that these things can work
1	I like helping people figure out the dosage recommended of a specific medicine and also look up symptoms to try and diagnose an ailment.

1	When my daughter was born she has SVT, which essentially was a hole in her heart that led to an elevated blood pressure.  She had to spend the first three days in the NICU, take medicine once a day for a year, and see the cardiologist once a week.  
-1	I had come out of surgery, was drugged up on morphine, and woke up to see that I had another person's me on my wrist band.  Local TV had a news story that said to always check the me asap.  It might have saved my life.
-1	I tore a muscle in my back off the bone working out. I was able to figure all this out by doing my own research and saved myself a lot of money by doing so. 
-1	I was diagnosed with breast cancer and I did a lot of research about it by finding every medical book on the subject and reading it and then going to see the surgeon to discuss my options. 
1	I don't think there are any great stories in my life that would tell about that kind of thing, so I don't know if this is any good...  I just try to follow the low-carb diet my doctor said I should follow every day and take my medications as directed.
-1	I've had CPR training through the red cross. I had to help a child I was watching when she choked on a mint.
1	I noticed my friend was smiling weird.  Her smile was crooked.  I knew this was a sign of a stroke and got my friend to the hospital.  They were able to give her medication to prevent a major stroke.
1	When I was a young child my little brother had chicken pox. My parent didn't speak English that well so I filled the medical form for them.
-1	I suppose helping a friend who's wife was pregnt as I had gone through the same thing a year prior.
-1	I persolly have been very lucky as far as my health goes. I have pretty good health for my age. My sister had cancer, I learned a lot while being with her at the hospital. My son was in a coma for thirteen days, I gained some knowledge while he was in the hospital. I do not think I have a great deal of medical knowledge. I did sell health and life insurance for a few years so I know some of the terminologies but not that much on what each condition details.
-1	When the doctors told me I have a leaky heart valve they explained to me that my heart was pumping some of the blood backwards, or regurgitating. 
1	I had a friend who was acting quite unusual.  Her behavior was odd, yet quite familiar.  As a person who is treated for depression, I have read up a great deal about the condition, where I even volunteer to counsel other who also experience depression. I knew the signs right away, and talked to her.  Luckily, I referred her to a licensed mental health specialist to get the care and propoer diagnosis that she needs.
-1	The first time I went to a doctor's visit alone. I had been enough times that I did not need any help asking questions or filling forms. 
-1	I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease so I researched it which led me to know that there is no cure for it.  Doctors still don't know what caused it.  People get it in their 20s.  There is a class of drugs called 5-ASAs which are prescribed for maintence of my condition.  I'm taking Lialda, which is a 5-ASA, to reduce flareups of Crohn's Disease.
-1	I went through many years of doctor's trying to figure out a mysterious illness that I had. After some time, I decided to start doing some research on my own. I was able to come up with something that I thought fit my symptoms very well and was able to find a few doctors who agreed with me and gave me an official diagnosis. 
1	I went to the doctor who was having a hard time explaining the pain I was feeling in my breast but I was able to help him articulate what he was trying to say. We laughed about it afterwards. He was a newer doctor.
1	For several years, I helped my parents with chronic health conditions including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. I learned a lot about those conditions and was constantly applying what I learned to daily situations including maging high and low blood sugar, confusion, and activating community resources for their situation.
-1	I started having bad headaches then I started having seizures. I had never had seizures before. about six months past and I had a stroke.   
1	I didn't have insurance and I had an abscess in my mouth where a tooth had decayed.  I ended up treating it with fish antibiotics.  This did the trick as I felt better in 2 days (but continued to take the antibiotics for a week).  A few weeks later I got the rest of the tooth removed at a dental school on the cheap.  But yeah I knew what to do in that instant without going to the emergency room and getting a huge bill and prescription I couldn't afford.
-1	I knew my symptoms were aligned with a certain diagnosis. I explained it to my doctor and he realized that I was correct based on my symptoms. 
1	I hurt my wrist and had to decide whether or not to make an appointment with my doctor or go to the emergency room at a hospital. I called my doctor and described my symptoms. They asked me about the location, appearance, and other details, and I chose to make an appointment rather than go to a hospital.
-1	When I had a bunch of fertility tests done. I had to go over everything from my cholesterol to vitamin deficiencies. 
-1	I have had a lot of UTI and kidney issues over the years. i was diagnosed with a UTI a few years back and took medication for it but i didn't feel that was right and kept researching my symptoms. Everything was pointing to stones and a few days later i passed a kidney stone. I learned all about the causes, effects, and preventatives to kidney stones
1	"I guess I would have to say one of the million or so times I had to deal with medical situations with raising three sons.  Looking back, it seems like one or the other of them was always hurt or sick!  They did keep me on my ties.  if we had ran to the doctor every time they ""stubbed a toe"", I would still be paying off doctor bills."
1	I have worked in a parasitology lab.  This has given me the knowledge to know the symptoms of various parasitic diseases as well as the ability to positively identify various blood stage parasites in blood smear. 
1	My mother had an inner ear infection that led to an absess in her brain. She was hospitalized with quite a few surgeries, and spend a couple of months in rehabilitation. There were several doctors explaining several things over the course of her treatment and recovery. 
1	My son has minor asthma symptons so I did some research and ended up understanding the causes and treatments.  There was a time when my son was having some chest pains and having a hard time breathing.  I couldn't find his inhaler so I had him stand in front of the freezer where I learned that the cool air helps with the breathing.  
1	I actually had a bacterial infection in my lungs and had went to a doctor who claimed it was a cold. I tried telling him I had no symptoms of a cold and he would not budge and told me to get some Robitussin or something similar. I ended up going to ER where I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection and receive the proper anti bacterial  medicine and within  two days the cough started to subside. Most Dr's just don't bother to spend the time anymore to ask and simply generalize what they think it is based on whatever may be widespread at the time as opposed to your symptoms.
-1	I will say it was when grandmother was diagnosed with brain cancer. Her brain swelled up and there was a medication that could be given her to lower the inflammation on the brain but she had diabetes and this will increase the glucose level. She was 75 years old and I expl to the doctor that based on what I read online the chances of her going into a diabetic coma were almost none. Based on what I read there is a little chance of a person with a high glucose level who is over the age of 70 going into a diabetic coma almost non existing and also she was going to die anyways, the tumor was not operable and it did not respond to radiation.
1	I was quite athletic when I was growing up. Did a lot of weight training and exercise physiology. When I injured myself and had to go to physical therapy. Everything that the therapist was talking about made perfect sense to me, and the verbiage and actual motions used during the exercises were all ready within my muscle memory.
-1	I just do a lot of research. I read a lot of books on medicine, illnesses and the medical profession and ethics. I watch a lot of documentaries on the topic also and my mother was a nurse.  
1	I helped my mother through a breast cancer fight and pallative care for pancreatic cancer.
1	I felt congested and had pain in my chest.  I could feel it when I inhaled.  There was a gurgling sound.  I went to the doctor and told him I had pneumonia.  He said he'd be the judge of that.  When the x-rays came back.  He agreed.
1	I have ran many marathons successfully and taken care of all recovery that had to do with it without any outside help.
1	My friend had recently had recently had a miscarriage and was having problems afterwards that was effecting her work and home life. I suggested that she might have reactive depression which is something that can happen after a miscarriage. She went to see a doctor and he confirmed I was correct. He put her on some medication and she saw a therapist which real he helped her get back to her usual self.
1	I demonstrate my medical knowledge from what I learn from my doctor to other people when the topics come up, for instance with my other friend's children are sick or hurt.
1	"I recently learned I have the MTHFR genetic defect from both parents (homozygous). I researched the genetic mutation issue and came to understand that my body does not ""methylize"" properly. In particular, my ability to convert folate to a useble form is compromised by about 70%. This has an effect on the efficiency of many methylation and detox pathways in my body. This also means I am more suspectible to certain health issues (fertility issues, depression, heart and vascular disease, Parkinson's). Some experts believe there are dietary and nutritiol options that can help to offset some of the effects of the ""mutation."" I am pretty well versed in what they are at this point."
1	I have never had an experience like this before. 
1	My daughter has had recurring fevers over the last few years. We've been to our pediatrician and specialists multiple times trying to discover the cause. It's led me to do significant research on auto-inflammatory syndromes, comparing her symptoms to those of the various recognized disorders. While certainly not a doctor, I feel fairly knowledgeable on auto-inflammatory disorders as a result.
-1	"My son while still in highschool got a concussion during practice and I was called to come and get him. I took him to the emergency room. The doctor gave the typical instructions on what not to let him do. I asked him if getting some of the amino acids that act as neurotransmitters to the brain help speed up his recovery. He looked at me as if I had three heads and answered I guess in disbelief that I actually knew something. His response was"" yes""."
1	Recently I've seen that I have more health problems if I sleep less, and my health is better if I sleep more.  So I've been trying to sleep more because sometimes if I sleep less my ear starts hurting.
1	I was feeling a shortness of breath. The doctor thought I was having an asthma attack but here it was just because I had not excericsed in a while and this was catching up to me. I had to slowly bring my excercise up rather than jump in right away.
1	I had a pain in my neck that was getting worse and I figured it was because I was using my tablet and my head was at a angle that was causing me problems. I started setting my tablet at different angle and over the course of a couple of weeks my neck pain faded and then completely went. If I would have still had the pain after a couple of weeks I would have went to the doctor, but since that time I have never had any problems with it again.
1	when my husband had to have surgery i had to help him fill out the paperwork and try to explain to him when was going to happen and how i would take care of him
1	A close friend developed high blood pressure and prediabetes. Doctors put him on medication that he didn't want to take, and they gave him a (truly) lousy diet and exercise program that would've ensured he stayed on the meds forever. I cleaned up his diet, got him on a sensible training program, and now he doesn't need to take any medication.
1	I play basketball a lot. I was also interested in sports medicine. I have twisted my ankle numerous times over the years. My knowledge on how to treat sprains was an asset to me. 
-1	I have completed a c program several years ago, I have also taken a medical terminology course and enjoy medical tv shows.
1	Several years ago I had a problem with my left shoulder. I would feel intense pain in my shoulder when I would to certain motions, but at other times it was not a problem. I thought it was shoulder impingement syndrome. I knew about this because two of my birding friends had the same problem and talked to me about it and the symptoms and the physical therapy treatments for it. So when it happened to me I thought I knew what it was right away. When I went to the doctor (who is NOT the same doctor I have now) he sent me to an orthopedic surgeon who confirmed that. But I already knew what it was, I just wanted to get the referral to start the physical therapy. I wish my doctor had listened to me more carefully and had given me the referral himself because I would have started treatment two weeks earlier.
1	i sometimes kinda diagnose my aliments using google,however i am not very good at it. when i was a teeger.my girl friend at that time was babysitting a 7 year old boy,who fell off a swing and broke his arm.she called me first since i was only a few houses away,and asked me what to do.i went over there and his arm had a u shaped fracture.i told her to call an ambulance.thats it,thats all i got.
1	I learned knowledge of health or medical issues as I was raising my children.  Also my parents had health problems early on because they smoked, ate food that was high in cholesterol so I've learned what not to eat and to exercise to stay as healthy as I can.
1	When I talk with doctors, I seem to understand medical terminology. I notice how similar conditions have similarities in their me. Also, I notice that drugs that control similar aspects have similar pre- or suffixes. 
1	My friend told me about a disorder they had called celiac disease and I already knew quite a lot about the disorder. 
-1	My blood pressure was high. I began to eat better and exercise. When it remained high, I talked to my doctor and started blood pressure meds.
1	When my mother was diagnosed as diabetic, we were told to limit her carb intake. I spent time reading several guides given to me by her doctor and attending two classes given by a registered dietitian. Through diet and medication, we were able to lower her fasting glucose levels significantly.
1	I had leg swelling, and red blotches above my ankles, so I went to a clinic that open.  The doctor there told me that I had cellulitis, but I didn't think so because there was too much pain involved.  I decided to go the hospital ER and get a different opinion.  After the results of the tests, I was informed that I had three blood clots in my outer vein.  I was given antibiotics and a list of doctors to see for the recommended surgery.
1	Sometimes the math of medicine is a little bit confusing and you have to be very careful not to make any mistakes.
1	I was being evaluated for high risk pregncy due to a blood clot early on.  I had done a lot of research prior to visiting the doctor so that I would have knowledge to understand what the doctors were going to recommend in relation to how my pregncy would progress and how my birth would be.
1	I was able to lose weight a few years ago when I realized that I needed to. I lost about 30 pounds, which was my goal. I accomplished this weight loss by avoiding junk food, eating more fruits and vegetables, and walking every day. I still follow these healthy routines so I can stay fit and healthy.
1	I did my own research on some skin conditions. After successful application of ointments I discovered during my research I felt quite competent about self-treatment of those skin conditions.
1	I cant think of any one specific incident.  There have been a few times I have administered first aid like the heimlich maneuver or recognized someone needed to go to the hospital because of a fever or difficulty breathing, etc.
-1	I worked in the service as a nurse aid and learned a lot about the basics
1	I was trying to figure out my results from a blood test.  Much of the information was abbreviated or included terms I was not used to, so I would use the internet to look up the definitions to help determine the results.
-1	I suffer from high blood pressure and obesity I have to monitor everything.
1	I woke up with a cramp in my leg one morning. I took a spoon full of mustard and the cramp went away within 2 minutes and never returned.
1	I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with possible cervical cancer.  The doctor sent me in for a myriad of tests.  I filly had to have surgery to remove the cells that were cancerous.  I followed up ahead of time on all the possible outcomes and any side effects.  Surgery was the best outcome to remove the cells and not have it spread.
1	There hasn't really been just one significant experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health and medical issues. There's just small things that I do to alleviate or resolve medical issues that pop up. For example, I take apple cider vinegar for my indigestion because I know that I have low stomach acid. And I take frequent breaks and move around to prevent my sciatica nerve from acting up.
-1	I care for my mother moderately. She is independent and usually takes care of herself but doesn't have information on important health facts. One afternoon she described to me how she had had difficulties pouring her coffee, she explained how she had to hold one arm with the other to even lift minimally. I insist recognized the symptoms of stroke. We went to the ER where they did find she had a stroke.
1	My fiance was out of town visiting family and he started feeling sick. Each day that I talked to him he sounded worse. I filly convinced him to go to an Urgent Care and he was diagnosed with an Upper Respiratory Infection.
1	I don't know a lot about health or medical issues.  When I have questions I refer to professiols or any other reliable source of information.
-1	When I was younger I had a terrible problem with heavy menstrual flow, cramps and fibroids. I did my own research, and worked with a conventiol and altertive health care professiol to obtain the results I needed to get rid of the problem. Today I am fine and in great shape.
1	Using online resources I determined that I had a zinc deficiency. So I purchased a zinc supplement and shampoo containing zinc to improve my general health. 
-1	i was shoot in the leg and i know to tie my leg up to stop the bleeding
1	The increasing pain, stiffness and swelling in my big toes and ankles was an indicator that I had a problem with arthritis, since it was persistent but fluctuated in intensity depending on the weather, not due to trauma or recent injury, and consistent with the development of arthritis in my aunt when she reached the age I'm at now.
-1	When I had my spil cord tumor I did a lot of research.It has come in handy with  neurologists I have seen over the years.For the fact some are just not experienced with that type of tumor.I have probably taught them a thing or two.
1	Getting preventive care and treatment.  Understanding the blood work data, the colonoscopy and all related.  To be able to know what I needed to improve on and to watch.
1	When I was told I had high cholesterol not only did I understand the changes I would have to make I also further researched the issue to make sure I was on the best diet and treatment possible and brought up with my doctor a couple of concerns I had. I was proactive in trying to understand this issue and with work, I did.
-1	When I started breaking out in like a rash and skin kept growing I thought it was psoriasis based on what I had seen before and I turned out to be correct when I went to a dermatologist.
-1	I whought I had a sinus infection, went to the doctor, and that was confirmed 
-1	I am learning about health and medical issues every day. I have several medical problems that I see a doctor about monthly and I frequently have to go to specialists for this test or that.
1	My children will frequently get sick, and my two year old recently had a slight fever of 99.6, but I simply gave him some over the counter Tylenol, and made sure he stayed hydrated with water and Gatorade. My six year old had the same conditions of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. I knew it was probably a virus, and did not feel it was necessary to take him to the doctor for it.
-1	I received training as a home health aid and participated in certifications such as CPR and First Aid training.
1	Once I remember seeing a medical category on Jeoparody!, the game show. I think I got almost every answer.
1	My best friend found some thickening bellow her collarbone. I told her to immediately go to the doctor because I knew there's a big possibility that it's a breast cancer. It turned out to be nothing scary but the doctor told her that I gave her a good advice.
-1	We often have health fair's at our church and when i checked a child's temperature it was at 102. I knew this was kinda high and alerted the nurses. 
1	After an off-road motorcycle mishap I knew that my leg was seriously damaged.  My leg had been wrenched around under the heavy bike, and I had actually heard a sp.  Once we were able to get the motorcycle off my leg it was obvious to me that there was a serious fracture, perhaps a compound fracture, as any movement would result in a feeling of bone grating together.  I decided that the best thing to do was to keep my tall, heavy boot on to stabilize the lower leg.  I was uble to walk due to the pain, so my friend carried me to the shade so that I'd be out of the hot sun and we elevated the limb.  He went for help leaving me with food and water, I was hungry, but resisted eating much in case surgery would be necessary when I ended up in the hospital.
1	This is a tough question for me.  I dont ever remember an expeience that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  There were a few times when I knew that one of my children needed to see a doctor, but in these times, my knowledge was intuitive rather than inherant.
1	Not sure if this is what you are looking for but true story. A few years ago I experienced severe pain in my feet that lasted for weeks. I looked up the symptoms and was reasobly sure it was something called plantar fasciitis (sp?). It HURT. I went to my doctor and he agreed with my assessment. Unfortutely there doesn't seem to be an effective treatment other than stretching and not walking (or walking as little as possible) for many months to allow the muscles in the foot to heal. Near the end of the appointment my doctor offered me a shot of cortisone for the pain. I was surprised and promptly refused. The problem with the cortisone shot, in my opinion, is that it simply masks the pain and might lead me to overdo it during a time when I needed to rest, thus making the injury worse instead of better. It took over a year for the problem to go away. Even though I suffered through the pain I feel I made the right choice because the cortisone shot might have made the recovery last even longer!
1	After having a stress test done I am now informed about all the risks and causes of heart attack and stroke. I had a false positive stress test, but I feel that I have gained a lot of knowledge associated with the heart. Now I have a lot of knowledge and useful information to help take care of my heart and help my family take care of theirs.
1	A few years ago, I had to watch my mother die of a disease that should have been treated years before, but none of her doctors could ever diagnose it until it was too late. I found it appalling how little the medical professions knows and how much they say they know. It was left to me to care for her, almost without their help. I had to literally demand palliative care for her.
-1	Someone close to me started to freak out about a bump in their buttocks--from persol experience--that sounds like hemorrhoids. I was quite surprised that she was freaking out about such a thing, but it indeed turned out to be hemorrhoids. Another one that comes to mind is that a friend said he had abdomil issues and other related symptoms of appendicitis--I only thought of it because I did some research myself in fear of having it. When he went to his Doctor, it turns out I was correct.
-1	I was given a choice to get a flu shot I was told of all the side effects and I decided to get it.  Later I felt awful.  I called the doctor he stated that it happens sometimes.  I should just drink a lot of fluids and rest.
-1	when my boyfriend was complaining about symptoms in his hands, i suggested that he had carpal tunnel. i knew this because my mom had similar issues with her hand/wrist and it was very likely carpal tunnel. he went to the doctor and he indeed had carpal tunnel. 
1	I have a family with a medical background on both sides of the clipboard.  This survey is mostly simple math.
1	Knowledge of my medical condition has helped me to avoid putting myself in a situation where I would be endangered. I know that I will put myself at risk if I do certain things that would increase my heart rate. I also need to slowly raise my health level through proper eating and strengthening myself to make my heart work less. Therefore by overhauling my nutrition and by avoiding those situations I have demonstrated knowledge of health issues. 
1	My family has a long history of medical issues, primarily autoimmune diseases. It has been imperative we stay as healthy as possible as many doctors are not knowledgeable in this field. Treatment is typically left to us and in several cases had better medical knowledge been obtained, lives would have been extended. One family member was lost due to a medical mistake, another to incorrect diagnoses, and another has had quality of life severely impaired because of incorrect diagnoses. I struggle with my own health and have two children with a complex medical history. I have also become the primary caregiver to my mother who is now severely impaired. If I am not fully aware and knowledgeable then the risks are simply too great. It's worth it to me to learn and understand all that I possibly can.  
1	I try to stay abreast of my health knowledge on different topics. I especially try to stay abreast of my own health issues and concerns. I read on online and see what the current news is in the medical industry.
1	I am working to lower my A1C count due to being pre-diabetic along with trying to lower my cholesterol. I am exercising and cutting back on sweets. I am also cutting back on my fat intake. I have been working on this for the past 5 months. I will be tested again in one month. I have read many articles and talked with my doctor regarding these tests.
-1	I spent a half a year researching if I had diabetes or not.  I found out a lot of things that contributed to diabetes, so I lost weight and balanced out my hormones. I also looked into people who reversed diabetes.  This saved me from the disease. 
1	An experience in my life that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I researched an upcoming procedure for my husband and got information about it and gave him suggestions as to things to bring up with his doctor.
1	One of my coworkers sees the same doctor as I do.  She was telling me about a recent visit and had a question about some of her blood work.  I was able to answer her questions because I had experience in similar blood work.
1	I helped to take care of my diabetic brother when he was little. I had to use nutritiol labels to determine how many carbs he had eaten and then figure out how many units of insulin he needed to take. 
1	The best example that I can think of was when my young daughter started having bed-wetting issues long after she had learned to go to the bathroom herself. The doctor did some tests and ruled out a UTI, which I was familiar with, then wanted to rule out constipation. She did this by doing some x-rays on my daughter. Sure enough, she just hadn't been drinking enough water and was really constipated, which was putting pressure on her bladder. This whole thing was pretty easily understandable, and was explained well by our pediatrician.
1	It was a time in summer, when one of my friend started feeling dizziness while playing in sun. We helped him to get him under the shadow and had him drank some water and after that he was felling better.
1	When I helped a family member that had very serious issues I took the family member to all the medical appointments and stayed in the hospital through all the surgeries with them.  I don't know if that demonstrates knowledge but I learned a lot of knowledge doing it I think.
1	My mother was having back problems, anemia and hair loss. The doctors didn't know what was wrong. I did my own research and asked the doctor to test for a genetic condition that was not common in our racial group . The doctor agreed to run the test and it turns out, my mother had the condition, also so do I.
1	I think you have to have somewhat of an understand of medicine otherwise you can't trust if your doctor is right or wrong 
-1	When I was diagnosis with cerebellar ataxia.  I never heard of this disorder nor did anybody I know.  I have done a lot of research over the past five years including a couple facebook groups.
1	When my mother was diagnosed with stage 3 endometrial cancer I knew there wasn't a study or trial for her to participate in because I was transcribing for an oncologist at the time. 
-1	just what i eat and looking at labels. trying to stay within the 2k calorie of a daily intake of food and try to eat more healthy.
1	An experience was when I was having high blood pressure. I am at a normal weight and exercise regularly. I went to the doctor and he wanted to put me on some pills which I read had bad side effects. I went home and read about it and found that l-arginine lowers your blood pressure and since it's an amino acid there's no side effect. I started taking it and my blood pressure got lowered and I didn't need to take the pills that were prescribed.
1	One time I was stabbed in the. Because I knew that it had hit one of the main arteries I new to go to the hospital immediatley.
-1	When i had a stomach bug. I knew that steps i had to take in terms of what kind of food i should eat and which ones to avoid.
-1	I have moderate experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues. I am somewhat confident.
1	When my wife was pregnt I felt like I was able to understand and comprehend all that was being discussed about the pregncy.
1	I went to the doctor for a cut on my hand, I needed stitches but the blood wouldn't stop. The doctor didn't know why and was about to give me medicine to make my blood clot. But I told him that I had taken aspirin. I knew that aspirin thins my blood and makes it harder to clot. So I told him and it saved me from having to take medication I didn't need. 
1	I had a colonoscopy at 32, that showed and removed several polyps, two pre-cancerous. I was told to have a repeat colonoscopy every 3 years, even though my 2nd generation family has a genetic defect that causes a greater, aggressive risk, and the fact that I was only 32. I researched the subject and decided to have one every year. Good thing, because for the next eight years, they always found some. Now I have one every three, if they don't find anything.
1	I took my mother to a health clinic to have them look at a problem she was having with her foot. there was a sign on the wall telling people they should report when they have been outside the country. I asked the doctor why weren't they interested when and if people traveled to Florida and may have been bitten by a mosquito. she agreed that that would be a good idea, but I doubt they printed up new posters or asked anyone then or now
1	I had premature children that were 10 weeks early and were male. The fact that they were male they had a lower survival rate then if they were female infants since female infants tend to be stronger. My sons were on oxygen and until they were down to 20% and weened off a respirator they were at risk of vision and other health conditions.
1	I was able to successfully perform the Heimlich maneuver for a gentleman that needed my help.  I was able to successfully pass CPR courses which demonstrates knowledge of medical issues.
-1	I have administered first aid and CPR to several individuals 
1	I had gone to the doctor for a checkup and was told that my cholesterol was borderline high and that we needed to keep an eye on it, and that I might have to take medication. I laughed and said that I was not going to take cholesterol lowering meds, and that I could make it go down just by changing my diet. the Dr. gave the usual spiel about genetics and how that was not always possible and I went on my way. A couple of months, at most, later, after eating mainly vegan, I went back and it had gone down 20-some points. I know a lot about the things that contribute to chronic conditions, and what to do to help the body heal.  
1	As a medical professiol, my everyday experiences are  a constant testament of my medical expertise and knowledge given my involvement in patient care. 
-1	when i noticed symptoms in one of my friends and told him to see a doctor 
-1	I have endometriosis and had some of my female organs removed but some were left in me. I was able to recognize the signs and symptoms of the endometriosis flaring up and getting worse on my own and was able to make an appointment and my doctor confirmed I was correct. 
1	My brother has type I diabetes. He recently came to visit and in the morning he was unresponsive. I knew that his blood sugar must be low because he was incoherent and combative. I called 911 and when the paramedics arrived I explained what had happened and they were able to quickly check his blood sugar and give him a glucose drip to bring it back up. 
1	My experience is based on news stories, persol experiences, family experiences, now outdated first aid courses, and college biology. I have used my knowledge to determine when I or a family members need to go to a doctor or emergency room and to reassure and explain  information to my niece and nephew. 
-1	I have 4 children and all of them have issues with breathing. I gain more knowledge as each child disease progresses.
-1	I had a doctor present to me various things about my check up. I understood what my blood pressure was and things like that. Just had a good common awareness of the information.
1	Being pregnt and giving birth to my children gave me good experiences with medical fields and medical documentation. 
1	"I'm not really terribly interested in ""wet"" sciences. Because, frankly, ""Eww."" I understand what I read and I don't leave the health of my children to chance, but I don't go out of my way to seek out new medical knowledge."
1	I was in a long term relationship with someone with Type 1 diabetes, so I learned a lot about insulin resistance, carbohydrates, and the glycemic index. 
1	i have been around the medical field for about 20 years, but when it comes to being a patient i am like a novice. it is very hard for me to process being sick, i mostly have denial over it. as far as knowledge, i now a lot about health from working in health related fields.
1	I would get strep throat regularly in the past. I don't exhibit the common symptoms associated with it, but I knew I had it. I made the doctor take a culture. It confirmed strep. The next time I had it, I opted to NOT take antibiotics, stay home for 3 days with lots of hydrations and Advil to keep my fever down. My hopes were to get over it and build a tolerance to it. It worked and I have not had strep throat in the decade since. Most recently, after breaking out with a skin rash of sorts, I figured out it was dyshidrotic eczema and went to the doctor.

1	"After my third in-vitro cycle resulting in no viable follicles via aspiration, I knew something was very wrong.  I knew I would need help getting pregnt, but to have ZERO follicles aspirated after seeing 18 on the ultrasound was very unusual.  I saw many specialists about the problem and their best answer was ""You're a medical anomoly"".  I did research myself, and thought that maybe I had what's called Luteinized Unruptured Follicle Syndrome.  When I brought that information to the ""specialists"" they agreed that must be my issue."

I knew from dealing with different things while taking care of her that something had changed in the time I had talked to her until I got to hospital. I talked to the nurse who told me she had had her morning medicine. I ask to see her chart of exactly what she had been given. The nurse wasn't happy about that but I assured her I wasn't trying to cause trouble I just wanted to find out what was wrong with my mother. After looking at her chart I realized she had been given too much of one of her medicines. There was an error by doctor or hospital in what she actually took. I immediately called pharmacy spoke to pharmacist, explained what had happen and had him look up what to expect. It wasn't an amount that would cause any damage, just make her feel bad for awhile. I had to take control as all the nurse seemed concerned about was who's fault it was. I explained to her...mistakes happen..we're human but when you make one or one is made you try to correct it asap.
1	"I had surgery on my abdomen which left a scar from my waist to mid-chest. I developed a hernia soon after. Someone asked me what happened since they could see me ""stomach"" sticking out so far. I was able to explain that surgery weakened muscle and other tissue resulting in a hernia. "

1	I can't really think of any examples.
1	I took a C class a few years ago when I was exploring different things, and I thought it might come in handy to know this stuff anyway. I already knew most of the things on the tests, but it was good practice to know how to take BP and the other measurements. Other than that, I can only say I usually do research on a condition that a close relative might have, so I can send them the info if they're interested. But it's frustrating to not have access to some of the medical research materials online.
1	When I was 14 my father was diagnosed with lung cancer and died 3 months later after having gone through both chemo and radiation treatments.

I'm not sure what to do about the letter I received from the doctor's office stating my results were all normal,  I don't have exact figures but my level was like a 1.1  and  normal was starting over 3,  anyway.  With being a past medical transcriptionist, I have learned meanings of a lot of medical terms, no way an expert, just general of course.

All of the symptoms of flue went away but the cough stayed for more than a month, my whole body was sore from coughing.

1	A few years ago, a nurse practitioner prescribed buspirone for my anxiety. I reminded him that psychiatric drugs in general tend to affect me much more strongly than they do most people, and suggested that I should start at the lowest dose possible. He wrote the prescription for the second lowest dose available. When I got home with the medication, I broke the tablets into quarters for the first week, then into halves for the next week. I didn't have any adverse effects, but did not really see any positive effects either, so on the third week, I took whole tablets as prescribed. I got very useated, extremely dizzy, and found it nearly impossible to stay awake. I continued at the recommended dose, thinking that maybe these were side effects that would wear off with time, but they persisted. I tried to reach the nurse practitioner, but he was on vacation and I didn't feel comfortable discussing it with anyone else in the office, so I went online and looked up information about the medication. I learned that what I was experiencing were symptoms of a severe overdose of the medication. Going to an emergency room was recommended, but I felt certain that no one would listen to me if I tried to explain my drug sensitivity and that they'd probably think I took some illegal drug. I'm aware that some psychiatric drugs recommend tapering off rather than stopping abruptly, so I looked for this information online and found that while it's not recommended to stop abruptly, in some situations it may be necessary. I decided that this was one of those situations, so I stopped taking the medication. The symptoms decreased appreciably within several hours, and though there was some lingering dizziness, everything else was more or less back to normal within a few days.

1	An experience in my life that demonstrates my knowledge of health is that working out makes me look and feel healthier. Prior to doing cross training I felt lethargic and dull.

I gained this knowledge through media and websites that I most recently frequent.

1	Last year when I fainted. It happens from time to time and I could tell it was happening from the world blackening from the outside in. I was in the kitchen and started lowering myself before my body gave out so I wouldn't fall and hit my head and I started calling my boyfriends me since he was home with me. I already told him some years ago that this happens and just get me some water and maybe a cold towel for when I wake back up.
1	Cannot recall
1	I was at the scene of a car accident. The occupants in the car were not in any further immediate danger.

1	"When I was 37 years old, I discovered a flat but palpable tumor under my  left breast. It was found to be ""hot"" and otherwise suspicious, plus I had other small spots show up in the mammogram in my right breast. Biopsies were done and no cancer found, but the surgeon, at the time, recommended bilateral, subcutaneous mastectomies. After talking with my husband, my PCP, and others, plus doing a lot of research, I filly decided to go ahead. One year later, I was referred to a reconstructive surgeon who placed silicone implants under both breast flaps.  I still have those same implants and I'm now 81. I've had no problems with them. Of course, the various doctors get the credit for good work and incredible support for me, but I also take credit for studying the issue and making a hard decision that I feel helped keep me safe from cancer all these years."
-1	When I went to the ER for some back spasms, they wanted to give me 10ml of morphine. I'd never had it, but I knew that I was easily susceptible to medications and their effects, so I told them to please start at 2, and we could work our way up. By the time we hit 4, I was pain free, but I was also barely able to walk on my own. I'm scared to know what it would have been like if they have given me 10. 
1	I was supposed to play golf one morning, but when I woke up I discovered that my back was bothering me. I tried loosening it up with some light stretching exercises, but that didn't help.

Ialso used a heat pad to it, and by the next week everything was better and I was able to play.

1	I noticed a place on my husband's face that was diagnosed as a sun spot by 2 internists and a dermatologist. It was very small and was not growing on the surface. I had my husband go to a new dermatologist, who also thought it was nothing, and have it removed. It was cancer! Took 2 cuttings to remove all cells and many trips to a reconstruction plastic surgeon to fix his face. We are now down to two trips a year for skin checks and have been clear for almost 5 years. I do not know why I felt so strongly about this spot, but I had my husband insist it be taken off even if it turned out to be nothing. Melanoma is nothing to fool around with. 
1	A friend of mine had a health concern regarding her surprising hair loss. I gave her advice and medical knowledge I'd researched myself regarding the topic.

1	Having to go see a specialist doctor and being able to converse quite easily with them about various conditions I had was due to research and learning as much as I could so as to have at least a general knowledge base to work with.

-1	I google my symptoms before going to a doctor. As the doctor examined me, I used my new found knowledge from the web to try to get the best medical attention possible.

1	I studied athletic training in college, and I've found that useful in emergent situations throughout life. If someone falls and cuts themselves or breaks something, I am confident enough to do what needs to be done immediately and then decide if they need to seek further medical attention. I recently helped an older gentleman who had tripped, fallen, and split his head. I knew to limit mobility until help arrived, and I knew to watch for signs of concussion (i.e. vomiting, blackout).

1	I looked up information on new treatments for a condition I have. I then asked my doctor about each of them, and whether they were applicable to me.

1	Years ago, my brother wondered why he was skinnier than I am, even though we ate just about the same amount of food.

Upon comparing it to mine, he noticed that although we ate the same amount of calories, his maintenance calories needed were higher than mine.
1	I went to the doctors about one issue and the doctor brought up another issue I was already aware of. I told them some of the things I already knew about the separate issue and they seemed impressed with my knowledge.It made me feel like I was in charge of and aware of my own health.
1	I felt a pop in my knee and it swelled up and I couldn't walk for days. I went online and figured out based on comparing my research to my symptoms that I likely tore my ACL.

1	I can't think of anything like this.
-1	My doctor was considering putting me on medication for high blood pressure and I was scheduled for an appointment to see her. When I did see her, I requested that she put me on a specific medication called Losartan since I did research on the medications my health insurance covered that had the least side-effects. There were also some other minor health benefits that might result from taking Losartan, which made the choice quite clear. My doctor is normally quite willing to listen to me and is quite reasonable and agreed to write me a prescription for Losartan.
1	I demonstrate knowledge of health and medical issues in my work every day. Whether it is caring for my own children or the patients I care for every day.
1	I was working in a commercial kitchen with volunteer staff and someone cut their finger while chopping vegetables.

1	I reminded my father, gently, that medicine is mostly preventative nowadays. Not a great example, but it's all I could think of.
1	When I went to see my dermatologist about a rash I had on my face, he wanted to prescribe me antibiotics. But, I insisted on anti-fungals because I had researched the rash online several times before meeting with my doctor, and I knew that if the infection was fungal, the antibiotics would make it worse. He looked some things up and eventually he reluctantly agreed, and I was eight. The rash was cured.
1	When my mother had cancer we did a lot of research. Everything that we found matched what we ended up hearing from the doctors. How the decease took its course did also. This showed my experience in gaining and having knowledge of medical issues.

I found one at Duke and was able to get him enrolled but he passed away before the trial began. 
1	I have been taking steps to improve my blood pressure and blood sugar level by eating healthier and exercising. It has been working. I have been losing weight and my numbers have improved.
1	I think the most memorable experience I can think of is when I started experiencing acute pain in my general groin area & started frantically googling the symptoms, prior to going to an emergency room, which were actually very hard to narrow down. Through a process of elimination, I was able to determine I was suffering from acute epididymitis, which the ER doctor was actually very reluctant to diagnose given that I did not fit into the typical risk group/rarity of occurrence, but that is indeed ultimately what it was.

-1	I had had some bad chest pains and thought I was having a heart attack it hurt so bad. I went to the ER and they did all the tests to check for heart attack and everything came back fine. They would not tell me what was wrong with me other than I didnt have heart problems. I got online and started googling my symptoms and realized that I had costocondritis which I had never heard of. So i basically diagnosed myself with it and did what everyone in forums had tried for theirs and eventually it got better and went away. 
1	My brother called me because my father was having chest pains, so I told my brother to find an aspirin and crush it up or have my father chew it, because I knew aspirin was recommended for heart problems and I learned from a neuroscience class that crushing it up gets it into the system faster.

1	After a bout of iritis I took a blood test.  They were looking for the genetic marker for ankylosing spondilitis and found it.  The doctor called me and said I had a 90% chance of having the disease.  I then looked up this information online and found that that's not what the results meant.  90% of people who have ankylosing spondilitis have the genetic market I have, but that's very different from my having it meaning I have a 90% chance of having the disease.
-1	An experience in my life that made me demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues was when I was out of shape and I would breathe very heavily after doing an activity. I read on the subject to gain more knowledge and try to prevent it from happening again. I had to get in shape.

I then told her that my glucose meter was giving me morning readings of 175, and  asked for a new machine because the old one was not properly calibrated. I was right! The new meter just gave me a morning reading of 124, which is more realistic.
1	I started having weird chronic adult acne in my mid 20s.  I figured something was wrong because no one in my family have this issue, and acne in general is not normal for someone in their 20s.  I went to my primary care physician who referred me to a specialist.  The specialist told me everything is normal, and prescribed a strong acne cream which damaged my skin, but also helped with the acne.  The specialist ignored all my concerns of me having abnormal adult acne to begin with, saying she only dealt with the skin - possible bad digestion or hormonal issues, all of which may cause acne, are not her business.  I spend the next few years dealing with the acne and being told by my PCP that maybe it's just normal for me.  I got sick and fed up with this, went to a holistic hippie doctor, who said I had issues with digestion, and prescribed a change of diet and probiotics.  With the hippie doctor's help and a change in my eating habits/supplements, I no longer have acne.

1	I woke up in the middle of the night with an extremely sore throat and swollen glands. It is unusual for me to be woken up in the middle of the night by anything, so I was concerned and went to get a glass of water. It hurt to swallow, so I decided to see what my throat looked like. When I found that there were white spots on the back of my throat, I knew that it could be strep throat and went in to the doctor. The test came back positive for strep throat. 
1	A couple of years ago, I stepped off the front porch of my new home and into a hole that was covered in leaves.  It was instant blinding pain for a few seconds, then I crawled into my house.  My ankle was huge and I couldn't put any pressure on it.  Everyone insisted that I go to the ER, but I looked up how to test fractured/broken vs. sprained ankles.  Canada actually had a great write up on it, apparently ER visits due to sprained ankles seriously hurt their socialized medicine policy due to costs.  I did their tests, and correctly diagnosed my sprained ankle then treated it accordingly.
1	i went the doctor once because i was having some problems. i had googled my symptoms and done some research to see what might be going on. the doctor diagnosed me with the same thing that i had suspected i had, so i felt like i had done a good job looking into it myself
1	I can't say that I've had a significant experience that would demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have a general knowledge and attempt to get some regular exercise, but always ask relevant professionals because it's better to understand what I don't know than to not know and think I know.
1	I fell out of a tree and hurt my neck. I didn't actually think I was hurt that bad but I made myself stop what I was doing and think about it.  Then I realized I could have hurt myself badly even if it didn't feel like it at the time. I ended up having somebody take me to the hospital (they didn't think I was hurt much either).  I ended up have a shattered vertabrae in my neck.  good thing i went to the hospital.

1	I have a wife with severe COPD and a heart condition that developed while she was in the hospital for her breathing.  I spent many hours talking with the nurses and the doctors as well as on line researching her conditon.  I was able to visit with her for 12 hours a more a day while she was in the hospital and monitor the care she was given.  A few times my research paid off such as the time they wanted to clean her room and I had to ask them to not use areosal due to her COPD and the fact that the areosol triggered it.
1	I had cancer at a younger age and through that episode I learned a great deal about treatments and the advantages of lifestyle changes, proper nutrition, etc.  I read about my disease and gained enough knowledge that when my Dr's spoke about meds and treatment I understood fully 
1	I saw the history of weight gain within my family, and also saw that I was starting to gain weight. I decided that while I had not gained a significant amount of weight yet, and while my schedule best allowed for it in the stage of life that I was in (i.e., I had a lot of free time), I wanted to take matters into my own hands and gain control of my weight before it became harder to do so. I exercised and took better care in terms of watching what I ate, and was able to gain control over my weight.
1	My mother was very sick most of my childhood, so I picked information here and there from her pamphlets and also her doctors. Also, in college I was in a Physician Assistant program where I started to learn a lot about health and medical issues. To get into that program, I had to shadow a doctor or PA for 500 hours, so I also absorbed a lot of information from there. 
-1	The only situation I can remember right now is that once I helped my mother understand the instructions for a treatment that she needed to have at home
1	When I was pregnant with my first child I developed a small lump in my breast. My doctor suspected that it was likely to be normal breast changes with pregnancy, but because of the size, density, location of the lump, they recommended an ultrasound to verify that it was not something more concerning. I went for the appointment and after the ultrasound it was determined that this was likely just a cyst. I felt very comfortable with that assessment as I have had numerous cysts myself, and I have a family history of them as well. 
-1	Whenever I think about experiences in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health and medical issues, I think about my grandpa having a heart attack. I remember sitting in the living room of my grandparents house with my grandpa and grandma and then all of a sudden my grandpa started rubbing his chest and saying that he had a tight pain and I continued asking him questions and trying to figure out exactly what it was that was wrong with him and if he needed to be taken to the hospital and eventually, I told him that we needed to go because he was having a heart attack and it turned out that he had.
1	In my early 30s I got serious about taking care of myself. I started going to the gym consistently. I started building muscle, my cardiovascular fitness improved, I could do more activities without getting tired and stopped having dizzy spells. I started reading diet-related articles, reading nutritional labels and cutting out saturated fat and excessive sugar, and increasing protein intake. I replaced fat with muscle and my energy increased.
1	My husband and I are currently trying to get pregnant. We tried a new method called invocell. During the process, 12 eggs were able to be retrieved and inseminated. At my age, 80-90% of those should have become embryos. Unfortunately, only one did and it did not implant. This means that something is wrong with my body that caused so little of those to become embryos.
1	I am diagnosed with schizophrenia and am fairly knowledgeable about the disease. I enjoy learning about it and having knowledge about it.
1	One night about three months after I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, I took 20 units of Humalog (short acting insulin) instead of 20 units of Lantus (long acting insulin) before bedtime. My boyfriend got upset and called 911. I ended up in the hospital for three hours having my blood sugar tested every half an hour, and paid $700 for the privilege. The next time I took the wrong kind of insulin at night, I did the math, made the appropriate amount of toast, slathered it with honey, and didn't tell the boyfriend.

1	I was prescribed a steroid and told the doctor I would not take it as it can effect the pressure in the eye and increase the chances of getting glaucoma. I have glaucoma and knew that taking steroids was an issue. 
-1	I experienced tachycardia (rapid heart rate) in my early 20's. This ailment can be caused by a plethora of different things, and it can be overwhelming worrying about what the certain cause is. I did an immense amount of research on my own in order to better understand how to prevent this. Later in life, I met someone who experience the same problem, and was confused. I was able to provide temporary relief to this person because of my past knowledge and experience with tachycardia.
1	I try to stick to the healthy diet and exercise a couple of times a week to be healthy. So i don't really have a lot of experience of health issues.
1	I was seriously injured when I was 24. I subsequently had to go through many tests and medical procedures which has given me much higher than average knowledge of doctors and medical procedures.

-1	I was having some stomach/reflux issues and my current doctor kept telling me there was nothing wrong. I did my research, and found a new doctor. It turns out that I did have a problem, and it would still be left untreated if I had not switched doctors.
1	I fell on my right hand one night and heard a pop. I knew I broke a bone in my hand - not just a sprain or minor injury - because my finger was unable to bend without pain and my knuckle was misplaced.
1	"I was on vacation with friends, and my friend's teenage daughter got sick with a high fever. We were in a third world country, and the resort's on staff ""doctor"" looked very young and unprofessional (she was wearing jeans). The doctor was going to give her a shot. I stopped her and knew enough to ask first exactly what was in the needle. Thankfully I asked, because the doctor actually could not answer the question! She said it was ""something like aspirin"". I advised my friend not to allow the shot to be given. Instead, we brought her daughter back to our room and gave her Tylenol and gatorade, which we purchased from the gift shop. Her daughter was fine by the next day."
1	One time I demonstrated knowledge of health issues by helping care for my cousin who has diabetes. I researched and asked questions, and learned where her blood sugar levels should be and what she could eat and couldn't eat at certain times and helped her measure her blood sugar.
1	I have to keep track of my dad's health information such as weight, body temperature, and medications after he received a liver transplant last year.

1	A few years ago I had a friend that was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she was admitted into a cancer treatment center. She was very worried about what kind of processes and procedures she would go through. I was able to talk to her about what she may experience because my father was also diagnosed with cancer and I watched him suffer through it for 6 months going through all sorts of different treatments. Because of my experience with my father I was able to talk to my friend about what she can expect and how hard the process is going to be.
1	I can tell the doctors the side effects of many antibiotics and what drugs you shouldn't take with them. I know drugs in clinical trials that the doctors don't know about.

1	i noticed i had some sort of rash under my arm when i first started college.  i did some research online using several reputable websites.  i figured out what i probably had was a mild skin problem called eczema.  i saw that a doctor can prescribe a cream for this.  i made an appointment and my doctor prescribed a steroid cream and it worked great.
-1	My daughters both got super high fevers. Once the fevers went past 100.4 I started giving them fever reducers. If the fever lasted more that a couple days or they developed other symptoms I took them to the dr right away. My 18 month old got a Hugh fever with no other symptoms. I did research after the drs sent us home with no answers. I concluded she had a virus call roseolla and I was correct. 
1	A partner I had at the time was starting to show signs of an Addisonian crisis (she was diagnosed years before with Addison's disease), and was starting to become delirious. I injected her emergency medication into her thigh and we went to hospital. 
1	I used the best statistical anaylsis I could to determine the answers to the questions.  I really don't know how any medical knowledge would help in this scenario because these were all math problems.
1	My daugther had a recent bone tumor found in her fractured pinky. She was to have surgery by taking a bit of bone from her elbow to replace the weakened bone in her pinky which would also be filed down to remove the tumor part.
1	after a while of taking various medications, i did research on each one so that i could gain knowledge on whether or not i needed to keep taking each one, or whether i could lower the dosage. i used this knowledge to have an indepth conversation about the medications with my primary care physician on the next visit.
1	I've had 2 children delivered vaginally via induction and had stitches afterward. I take medication for depression and anxiety and hypothyroidism. One time I cut my leg open and had to get 15 staples to close it.

1	Once when I was visiting my father he began to have numbness in his extremities and moderate chest pain. He believed it was just heartburn, but I convinced him to go to the doctor and he did in fact have a mild heart attack. From that point on I was instrumental in maintaining his cardiovascular health by helping him maintain a diet and exercise. He is now much more conscious of his health and willing to consult a medical professional about any questions he may have concerning his (or any immediate family/friends) overall wellbeing. So, by demonstrating applied knowledge concerning heart health I have effectively prolonged my father's life and very likely those of the people he spends his time with.
1	I know when i catch cold, what I need to take and what to do. I do not need to go to see a doctor while I had a fever.

Up to that point, I had been having them for 6 years without any issues but this time, the doctor called me the following week to tell me that I had an irregular pap smear and that the pap had shown that I had precancerous cells.  Because I had taken anatomy for 3 years and I was pretty enlightened on how the different type of cells all line up in  woman's reproductive parts, I instantly knew that it was serious.  I did not complain or argue when he got me into a specialist for the following week.  The specialist advised that he had to do a LEEP which again, I was familiar with so I had some comfort only because I knew what the process entailed.
-1	Not too long ago I was told that I had scar tissue on my liver.  This was caused years ago when my gall bladder ruptured.  I already knew what scar tissue was and how it could affect my liver.
-1	I have very little knowledge of medical issues. I am parent of two kids so I have had to use the little knowledge i have to take temperatures, treat fevers, upset stomachs and other ailments. My knowledge of head aches, which i have often has helped me with my kids in knowing what type of head ache they might be having and what could be causing it, whether it be dehydration or sinuses.
1	Not to long ago my mother in law was diagnosed with cancer.  She had to have surgery, and then some chemotherapy to make sure everything was good.

The chest pains subsided but I still have a lot of weight to lose.

-1	A time I can think about that demonstrated my knowledge about a health issue is when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. After I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, I went home to do some research on things needed to lower my blood pressure other than medication. At the time, a doctor I had did not tell me to make any lifestyle changes, instead just put me on medication which had me sleepy all of the time. A few months in, I was taking my medication and came to the doctor and got it checked and it was normal. The doctor asked if I was consistently taking my medication and I also explained that I was also making healthier lifestyle changes in which he was very surprised.
1	A few years ago I got kicked in the kidney in a soccer game and it was bruised. I knew that rest and inactivity would help the situation, so that's what I did. The body is made to heal itself in most cases.

1	The other day at work my coworkers and I were discussing the flu because a lot of people thought they had contracted it. I had done some reading on the flu, knew symptoms, how long it should last, etc. but many of my coworkers did not. They claimed to have gotten the flu, when in reality they just contracted some sort of virus that had similar symptoms to the flu.
1	I can always google what I need but going into the doctors or having a checkup and having them tell me my numbers for blood pressure and heart rate I can tell that those numbers are good for me or not. I keep an eye on my blood pressure and have actively worked to improve it over the years.

1	When my husband was in a car accident I was able to use my cpr and first aid training to help him and apply pressure to his wound until he got professional help
1	When I worked in a physicianâs office, a patient told me that he did not understand his blood pressure. I explained to him how he had high blood pressure and showed his history. I saw that ate a lot of fatty and sugar foods and made no effort to improve his eating habits. In addition, I saw this his sugar level was high and that he did not have much physical activity. I went over all of the information with the nurse to confirm that everything I was reading was correct. She confirmed that the information was correct that I was giving to the patient. 
-1	I can't think of a time in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues.  (I am usually fairly good at figuring out my dog's health issues, but that doesn't help your survey results.)

The EMTs didn't think I was having a heart attack and told me I could go to the ER or not, depending on what I wanted to do. I almost didn't go. I knew though that something was really wrong. I elected to go and went into cardiac arrest before we got to the hospital

1	After each of three babies, it was important to bring them to their many well baby check-ups. After my middle child experienced some difficulty with weight gain (he was gaining weight but not at the amount expected), I was on alert for the same issue with my third child. Indeed, it happened to him too, even though he did not have the gastric reflux issue that my middle child had had.

1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when my mother was complaining one night of having weird visual hallucinations of small bright lights. I took her blood pressure because she has a history of high blood pressure and it was about 170 systolic. I was concerned because her baseline systolic was around 130 on medication. Because of my knowledge, I was concerned that she may be at risk for stroke and her blood pressure was very high. I retook her blood pressure because if you get an abnormal reading, you should always recheck under the same circumstance. She had a headache also, so after rechecking her blood pressure was still around 170 systolic. I told her that we need to go to the ER because I was concerned about how high her BP is and her risk of stroke. She also smokes cigarettes, so her risk is increased. Her symptoms could have been dangerous and the abnormal visual hallucinations could have been aura for an oncoming migraine, but I didn't want to take any chances. I took her to the ER. She ended up being fine.

1	My son recently had a high fever so high that I decided to take him to the doctor. After answering the nurses and doctors questions, he was given a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen. I had to remind the nurse that I had already given him a dose of ibuprofen, so he could not have more.
1	I have been on clonazepam for years (for insomnia). Due to a mix-up, the prescription lapsed. Due to the fact that I had been on the drug for so long, my body experienced withdrawal.

1	I knew something was wrong with my eye and I kept putting off getting it checked out.  I figured if i ignored it that the symptoms would go away.

When the first surgery was done I was a novice and only knew some things but by the time the second surgery came along I was an expert.  When he showed me the x-ray of my discs I actually cut him off and told him what the scan showed.  I said there thats the bad disc and that portion needs to be removed in order to alleviate the pain.  I was right and he was somewhat impressed because it was different than the first surgery I had just read so much and looked at so many pictures that I knew what I was talking about.

1	Just last night my daughter said she had a sore throat. I looked at it with a flashlight. There were whiteish/yellow patches on her tonsils. I told her she may have strep. I know that the first thing a doctor asks when you take a child in for strep is if they also have a cough, which she did not. That's an indicator for them to actually do the strep test. Since she didn't have a cough, the doctor did the strep test on her this morning and it was positive.
-1	When I went in for a kidney infection when I was about 4 week pregnant. I told the doctor I knew that's what it was, and he listened.

1	A few years back there was a time where I had an abnormally large lump on my lower back that constantly itched, had a pain around the lump area. Aware of what it may be a cyst of sort, I searched on the web symptoms as to what it actually could be whether or not it was one. Through a thorough search I noticed all of the symptoms were lined up with what I assumed at first and waited it out a few days since it said that it could possibly burst on its own accord and there's not much to worry about aside from going to the emergency room of it actually does burst. So when it finally did on that day I was not only relieved that it wasn't any other sort but confident in my own initial observation.

I will still continue to get my information from medical professionals. All in all there's no experience I can say that shows off my knowledge. I just get a piece of it time from time.

1	As I ave mentioned in early blobs I have Congential Adrenal Hyperplasia and Dystonia both conditions I wa born with.

-1	I was diagnosed with an enlarged prostrate. The Dr. gave me thorough education. I also did my own research and developed a healthier diet. Eating clean and organic food.
1	I have a young daughter that had food allergies when she was very little.  It took many doctor visits and some research on my own to figure what was going on
1	I'm not sure what this prompt is asking. I think when I take my kids in to the doctor, I feel that I'm reasonably rational and calm. I feel like I don't immediately jump to the worst case scenario, though that is what I want to do in my head for myself. I
-1	I mean, most of it is common sense. I'm no where near as knowledgeable as a doctor. For the last 10+ years, instead of spending a bunch of money to go see someone who is only worried about getting through the day, I will just look online. If something weird is going on with my body, I will look online and gather knowledge.

1	I rarely seek medical advice from doctors. My last two visits were completely a waste of my time and money. So I have no such example to give you. 
1	I'm not sure if this really counts but a while back in college I noticed that I had put on significant weight and I was more out of breath than usual. I also noticed that I became a lot more thirsty and lazy than usual so I stopped and considered my risk factors. I know that my family has a high history of diabetes and hypertension (and high cholesterol), so I took it upon myself to buy a blood pressure monitor and measure my blood pressure over a period of a week. It was not favorable, so I talked to a nutritionist and made a healthy eating plan as well as an exercise routine. By monitoring it further, I successfully decreased my blood pressure significantly and it has remained in safe levels since I have continued my routine.
1	I once had a painful, bleeding (and puss) coming from my backside. I did a bunch of research on my own before deciding that I 100% had a pilonidal cyst. I went to the doctor and he confirmed the diagnosis. I had outpatient surgery.

I ended up having a kidney stone, but it would be passable. They offered me opiate pain medications but I decided not to take them because I know that they have addictive properties.  I ended up passing the kidney stone several days later.
1	I GAVE BIRTH TO 2 SONS, AND BOTH BY VIRGINAL BIRTH. I ALSO BOTH TIME GOT THE EPIDURAL TO HELP WITH THE PAIN. I AM LUCKY THAT I AM NOT ALLERGY TO ANY OF THE DRUG SO IT'S FINE FOR ME TO GET THE EPIDURAL.
1	My brother was shot in the chest in an attempted robbery and i had to help my parents discuss with the doctors everything that was going on. I had to help them understand the complications and the permanent effects that he was going to have. 
-1	I avoided catching diabetes by exercising and eating correctly for most of my life, its is health problem that runs in my family. 
1	I guess when discussing different medical problems with my husband.  I have a different knowledge base than him.  We both bring different knowledge to the table but, I know more about things that I suffer from.  Also, different problems in my family.
-1	My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago and at that time I didnt know much about it. Over the years I have educated myself all about it ans In turn that has given me the knowledge to take preventive measures for myself. A few months ago my aunt was diagnosed as well. Science has come a long way since I first learned about it so that knowledge that I had from the experience with my mom helped me to be prepared for any questions that my aunt had during her process and I think the fact that my mom went through it too help me as well to get through it.
1	I think I learned some information when I started going to the gym regularly years ago. Terms like resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, pulse rate, etc. where in the fore when I took on the aerobic portion of my workout.
-1	When I was 35 I was feeling really bad all of the time.  I fell generally unwell, dizzy, headaches, thirsty all the time, unable to sleep well and just feeling blah.  I had a weird feeling I was diabetic so I started to do some reading about it for a few weeks and got as much information as possible.  I then made a doctor's appointment and told my doctor what symptoms I had and why I thought I had diabetes.  My doctor was impressed with my knowledge and scheduled a test.  A couple days later I found out I was indeed diabetic.
1	When one of my daughters was ill, I knew that she was in a medical emergency situation as her fever shot very high. Though she was an adult, I knew she was incapable of handling this herself and rushed her to the ER, which the doctors said was good and immediately gave her treatment to bring down the temp safely and quickly. I was her advocate and wouldn't stop explaining her other symptoms, which they ran extensive tests on after I insisted and found the root cause. It was at that point they were able to correctly give her the medicine to properly treat her condition.
1	My son had some kidney problems related to an infection and had blood drawn to test his kidneys. I received the lab results via email from the hospital laboratory was able to read and interpret them myself before I received a call from the doctor about them.

1	I worked in a rural hospital that served as the local area cancer treatment center on the weekends.  I would sit for hours and register patients for treatment the following day.  I would have to file lab and xray results into their charts.  This was before everything went paperless.  I spent a lot of time reading notes and diagnosis because I worked a lot of second and third shifts.  I was still in college and I tried to make the most of my time when I was a work.  
1	My brother had been in the hospital and he didn't have insurance. We lived in NJ at the time and they add an additional amount onto your bill as an uninsured patients fund. I believe it was about 50% of the bill. I called around and after much effort discovered that uninsured patients weren't required to pay this part of the bill. It was only for insurance companies. I eventually received a form from the state of NJ and had my brother complete it and he mailed it. After we received the response, I still had to travel to the hospital and show it to the billing office because they were still refusing to adjust his bill. After I provided them with a copy of the response, they eventually adjusted his bill and he was able to pay the rest of the bill with the assistance of a plan he had that paid him for every day he spent in the hospital (about nine days). Sorry, this is the only experience I had that was related to your question.
1	"I was told I have high cholestrol and needed to make changes to improve that. I knew that it meant i had to get my bad cholestrol ""LDL"" to below 100 and the good cholestrol ""HDL"" to above 50."

1	I have absolutely no idea what you're asking. But I'll give this a shot. I recently saw a neurologist for another shot at figuring out what's causing the muscle weakness I've been experiencing for more than four years now. I was able to give her a timeline of symptoms, severity of the problem, list the tests that have been performed, and ensure that she understood everything. I asked her about a specific test, and she agreed that would be a logical next step. 
1	while at a restaurant, a patron was signalling that she was choking after eating a chicken wing. i recalled learning the heimlich maneuver in school, and i was able to successfully perform the procedure.
1	One time, my nephew cut his hand and was very nervous.  I proceeded to not only stop the bleeding, but give him a lesson in basic first aid.

He found this lesson interesting and informative and demonstrated these skills later on when injuring his ankle a few weeks later.
1	Once my gums above a certaion tooth became swollen and inflamed and it really hurt. I had no idea what it was but then I realized that a cavity that I had neglected to get taken care of was to blame. I went to the emergency room and they took an x ray and confirmed that it was an abscessed tooth.
1	My pregnancy required that I ask my doctor lots of questions about symptoms that I was experiencing. I frequently went to each appointment with a list of questions about what was normal and what was not. My doctor was impressed that I had learned so much about pregnancy and pregnancy complications.
1	Woman problem. I had my period for 8 months straight before my doctor got me into a specialist (gyno). I was quite confident when I was able to go back to my doctor and repeat what my gyno had said and understood what I was talking about. hyperplasia is the overgrowth of uterine tissue, which was causing that issue, but I also had multiple cysts at different times on different ovaries, but not in my uterus.
1	I knew I had knowledge of health or medical issues. When I pretty much diagnosed myself and told my doctor what was wrong with me. She ignored me and treated me for something else. Well I was back in there after my treatment was over and asked her to test me for what I thought was wrong. The testing showed I was right.
1	I had gained a lot of weight at one point, so I decided to lose the weight. I went on a diet and exercise program I made up for myself. I reduced my calories and fat consumption. Also, I decided to start running most days. I lost around 100 pounds in about 9 months. During this diet I was kept very close tract of my calorie consumption. I was ware of how many calories different foods have.
1	I don't have any experiences that demonstrate my knowledge of health or medical issues. I have never faced a life experience that required me to know anything. I do know about basic health issues such as obesity or what it feels like to have high blood pressure but i've never been in a situation where i had to demonstrate it.
-1	I canât say that Iâve ever had knowledge of medical issues that Iâve been diagnosed with before being told about the issue and what it is. As far as health issues I know that itâs not good to smoke or drink a lot. I know that keeping active and eating right help aid in staying healthy things like that.
-1	I have a thyroid issue where my body doesn't produce calcium. Ive had this issue for about 15 years. I have to see the doctor regularly because it can cause seizures.
1	I was at a festival and a person was experiencing dizziness and nausea. I noticed that the person was wearing heavy clothing even though it was a hot day.

I thought that the person may be dehydrated and overheated and told him he should slowly drink as much water as he could and to place a wet towel over his head and neck. 
1	My brother was recently in a car accident and in the years preceding I volunteered by Special Olympics, therefore I understood how to work a wheelchair, transfer a patient from a bed to the the chair, and other such apparatus know-how. 
1	I have been dealing with persistent colds and respiratory infections and recently, I looked up what I can do to get rid of them and have been taking steps in making sure that I no longer deal with them.  I have been eating healthy, exercising and sharing my tips with friends and family.
1	I am not good with math, so I need someone to thoroughly explain such stats to me rather than depending on my math skills. Most doctors I have had are willing to do that. 
1	I don't necessarily have knowledge of these issues. Whenever I or my family members have issues I usually research on the internet or consult with doctors or people who have been trained in this field.
-1	I was seen by an orthopedic surgeon for a chronic ACL tear and osteoarthritis in my left knee. I did physical therapy, and when I was released from therapy, he told me I'd be back in a couple years for a knee replacement. I told him not to hold his breath. Came home, and started walking longer distances - 4-6 miles a day. I lost 20 pounds, and took several anti-inflammatory and ligament strengthening supplements, and kept walking. That was 16 years ago, and I still have my knee, thank you. By the way - the doctor I saw needed to lose about 50 pounds.
1	Several years ago my father was in the ICU after being unfortunately caught in a store robbery. He was shot 3 different times and the medical issues were immense. I was successfully able to listen and understand the doctors as they were explaining everything to my family and I. Other family members came to me to explain it better in layman terms to them. 
1	My wife is a nurse and we have been married for nine years and she helps me understand all sorts of medical issues. Her along with Google makes things a lot easier to understand.

-1	I had a bad cut on my hand that probably could have benefited from having stitches. I took care of it on my own, however, from previous experience with bad cuts. Through proper bandaging, cleaning, and maintenance, I was able to heal the cut in about two weeks. 
-1	"My husband had severe pain in his left side after a pleurodesis procedure. He also had a fever, an elevated white blood cell count, and constipation. The doctor insisted it was just ""residual pain"" and the body's response to the procedure, while I kept arguing that it was more likely he had an infection of some kind. The doctor refused to do any blood work or send him for a CT scan to be sure, so we left that hospital AMA and went to another facility's emergency room. They found out my husband had a ruptured intestine, which required emergency surgery. He died 22 days later of sepsis from that rupture. Doctors don't always know everything and should learn to pay attention when their patients say something else is wrong."
1	every week, when we have exams, my knowledge on medial issues is tested in more ways than i can explain. Boards, are the ultimate test of my knowledge i guess, and thats in 3 mnths. 
1	I have borderline cholesterol issues.  So I have done a lot of research on eating properly  to keep that from going up.  I actually had it go down into a very normal range.
1	I hade to remove my gallbladder afte experiencing pain and found that I had multiple gallstones so I went through many tests and a medical medical surgery
1	In the past 1.5 years, I have lost 95 lbs. I had to pull from my knowledge of exercise and nutrition to achieve this. Additionally, I have had to understand how this affects my blood sugar, cholestrol, pulse, and heart rate. I have also had negative effects from my health goals in terms of exercise causing me injury and extreme pain. I have had to pull from my knowledge of how muscles, bones, and cells work to design plans that have gradual enough progress to prevent injury.
-1	An experience in my life when I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is in being able to assist when people are having seizures. 
1	I don't have a good knowledge on health medical issues. I take my doctor's advise or someone in the medical profession like a nurse. I know that because I am diabetic I need my blood sugar to be between 180 to 80 to be normal after eating 2 hours ago but within 4 hours or eating. In the morning before I eat it should to between 80 to 120. I know I should eat between 45 grams to 60 grams of carbs per meal, and 15 to 20 grams for a snack.
1	I honestly cant think of one where I have but Im always willing to go the doctor if something is wrong
1	my brother is a diabetic so once my friend was telling me he wasn't feeling well and he described  his symptom and   from my experience i could tell he had low blood sugar
1	I went in for a gastrointestinal issue and it was deemed that I needed a colonoscopy.  I was given a list of medications to consume in preparation as well as a process to follow for the surgery.  Without any assistance, I took the list and prepared myself for what turned out to be a successful procedure.
1	After tearing my ACL in 2012, I ended up re injuring it once again in 2013 and had to have two surgeries. By the second surgery I was already prepared with what I had to do for recovery and rehab.

1	When I got hired to work security for a large corporation, they put us through a special version of the CPR training so that we can be informed and help if anything were to happen while we are on post. I had previously taken the CPR training because I spent some time working at a hospital briefly and they required it. I demonstrated my knowledge by completely acing all of the tests and the demonstrations they had me perform, and even helped out other people who were having difficulties performing the tasks.
1	I researched and implemented a medical protocol (long-term, low-dose antibiotic) to recover from the affliction of undifferentiated monoarticulating HLA-B27-related spondyloarthropathy, in which I eventually went into remission after 3 years (that was 20 years ago, so I'm calling it permanent remission), avoiding becoming a certain cripple with a compromised immune system, or dead, as my colleague's husband ended up, from T-cell lymphoma, having the same doctor as I but actually following his advice to take methotrexate.
1	I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder several years ago. I had already suspected that diagnosis before going to to see the therapist as I had recognized panic attacks I was having as such, and also thought about other recent symptoms. I had looked up anxiety related disorders online, as well as various treatments (types of therapies, various drug treatments) before making my appointment. When the therapist diagnosed me and asked if I was interested in drug prescription as well as therapy I was able to ask about the various options, how they would affect my life, and what the possible side affects would be. 
1	I was having knee pain.  First surgeon I saw recommended knee replacement.  This seemed extreme for the kind of pain I was having.  I sought another opinion and had microfracture surgery instead.  
1	One of my grandsons was pulling on his right ear one day.  He couldn't talk yet so I knew something was bothering him.  He had a slight fever and just wasn't himself.  I figured it was an ear infection.  We took him to the doctor and it was an ear infection.  
1	I had a growth on the side of my torso that became inflamed every 3-4 months. One time it got very inflamed. I didn't know what it could be, so I went to doctor to have it checked. 
1	I've always had problems with cramping during my periods, and have had a history of ovarian cysts.  I had multiple exploratory surgeries to remove the cysts.  The cysts came on a cycle of approximately every five years, I would have surgery every five years to have them removed.  Finally after quite a bit of research and discussion with my doctor it was decided to do a partial hysterectomy and remove my uterus to see if that would break the cycle.  this worked for ten years, at that time I started getting the cysts on my ovaries again, with the pain being 75% of the month.  it was decided that my ovaries needed to come out to prevent this from happening.  By my doctor being informed on what the best course of action was for me I was able to keep my ovaries for a longer period of time, therefore not having to take synthetic hormones until absolutely necessary. 
1	When I was told I was pregnant. I immediately started taking folic acid, I scheduled my doctor's appointment, I stopped drinking alcohol, and I started trying to reduce my stress.
1	As someone who grew up with family members in the medical field and being around people who often had to take medication, I feel that I've had enough early exposure that I'm not uncomfortable around medicine. I'm also in pre-nursing at the moment so some of the pre requisite classes I've taken as well as advanced reading I'm undertaking have given me some insight and knowledge into these kinds of things
1	I do not have any experience at all regarding health or medical. Everything I know if from experience or looking it up online or in a book. Or asking my mother.

1	The only thing that I can really think of is a time when I developed pneumonia.  As I stated earlier in the survey, I never go to the doctor unless I'm sure something is wrong.  I felt myself over the course of a two week period becoming less energetic and more and more out of breath doing simple everyday things.  I continued to go to work during that time assuming that my body would defend itself and I would snap out of it.  When I coughed at work and expelled a mass of oddly colored phlegm, I new something wasn't right and went to the doctor that afternoon after work.  That's when I was diagnosed with a form of walking pneumonia.  I hope that's near to what you're looking for.
1	I have raised a family , with two children, who are now 34 and 36 years old.  I faced and dealt with the whole spectrum of childhood mishaps, common illnesses, and accidents, thank God successfully.  Mainly I got good at discerning when medical help was absolutely needed and when I could handle it myself with  ordinary first aid and care.
-1	My husband was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes close to a year ago. We both have become very educated on eating healthier and also managing insulin levels. 
1	My friend asked me about a test that he got at the doctor. I looked it over and actually had some knowledge about it. I explained what I knew about it to ease his mind, and told him to get more info from his doctor.
1	When my friend had an asthma attack, I was able to talk her through it.  By calming her down, locating her rescue inhaler and administering said inhaler.  In having the condition myself, I know it can be scary and responding with calm is much better than responding with panic.
1	When one of my kid is sick, I have to trust my knowledge of health in deciding when they need to see a doctor or if we can treat their illness at home.
1	I had cancer. I had to learn and adapt very quickly. While I went through treatment I had to trust my doctors that they were being open and honest with me about my cancer.

-1	I would have to say that an experience that I demonstration my knowledge on health and medical issues would be when I gained 15 lbs in a year and decided that was way too much.  It was caused by a medication I was taking so I requested to get off that medication, started walking fast everyday and lost the weight. 
1	I am an emergency medical technician. Everyday that I work, I see, diagnose, and treat life-threatening medical conditions. I am interested in medicine and ask questions frequently.
-1	I am a runner and when I received injured to my foot I would study resources relating to the anatomy of the bones and muscles in my foot so I could pinpoint what was going wrong and how to fix it. Later on, when I would go to my podiatrist, they would explain possible symptoms to me. I was able to hold a comprehensive conversation because I had learned much about how the foot works and learned the jargon necessary to convey a detailed diagnosis.
1	I started to develop a rash on my arm/wrist and visited a dermatologist to help determine the cause of the rash. In preparing for the visit, I listed out foods I had recently eaten as well any outdoor activities that may have had me come into contact with any plants or insects. In talking through the situation with the dermatologist, I mentioned that I had eaten a cherry pie very recently to which he noted that certain red dyes in such foods can cause random rashes. Since all other foods I had eaten were not out of the norm and my activities did not bring me into contact with any poisonous plants, we were able to determine that that pie consumption was the most likely root cause.
1	A friend asked me where she should go for prenatal checkups. I felt that my doctor was knowledgeable and caring so I sent my friend to that doctor. The friend was pleased with the doctor.
1	My knowledge about health issues, starting with myself, was when I had my wisdom teeth pulled under general anesthesia at the age of 22.  I also had a cryosurgergical procedure done following an abnormal pap smear.  Cervical cancer runs on my mother's side of the family.  I've had a C-section, Appendectomy, Gall Bladder removal and taken care of my mother with dementia to her last days on this Earth.
1	I have a thyroid disorder and through much research and dr visits I am able to tell exactly where my thyroid level should be for me to feel my best.
1	My mother had Parkinson's Disease and I unfortunately had to learn about Parkinson's Disease and he stages of the disease itself. 
1	I have learned that to reduce your weight and improve your health is to reduce the amount of fats and carbohydrates in your diet.

1	I recently had a medical scare where I thought I was catching a serious cold. I had a high temperature and was extremely sick. I knew I should go to the doctor immediately so I did so and got antibiotics. 
1	I have found bee propolis and elderberry to be very effective in treating the common cold. While on my job I have in many instances seen people who were sick quickly recover after I give them a couple of capsules of these. They are effective because they enhance and boost the immune system to fight the virus.
1	I had some shoulder pain that I had researched a lot on my own before I went to the doctor.  The analysis I was able to give about the type of pain and the motions that caused it helped us pinpoint it much more quickly than if I hadn't done so.
1	I used to be a medical transcriptionist. My grandmother had gotten home from a doctor's appointment and had not understood what exactly they were telling her. Upon hearing what the doctor told her, I was able to explain some terms to her that she didn't know what they meant before.
1	I don't know if I could do that the best I can come up with is that I know some good ways to prevent myself from having a seizure and I can also feel when they are coming on in time for me to get somewhere safe. That is pretty much the extent of my knowledge I don't know how to do much that is not related to that is pretty much my life.
-1	I ripped the tendon in my arm from the elbow to hand, when I went to the emergency room they wanted to xray the arm, I told them several times it was not a bone, however, the xrayed it and found nothing wrong, after going to my pcp and having an mri, he found the tendon was ripped. I worked as a pharmacy tech for many years, so when people come in with a fever, that you can alternate between tylenol and advil every 3 hours. I can usually help my friends when something is wrong by giving them advice about what to take, such as my friend had hurt her knee and was having trouble walking on it, so I told her to take ibuprofen and ice it, the next day she was able to walk and went to the dr.

1	I had a kidney stone when I was 8 years old and I was in the hospital for 5 days with them having no idea what I had going on. I also had 5 miscarriages in my later years. They couldn't figure out what that was caused by either.

-1	Recently, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I accompanied her to several of her appointments and was able to help interpret some of the information she was given, as she was very overwhelmed.
1	I have several fruit allergies including bananas, kiwi, strawberries, and grapes. As a young child we did not know this. When I would eat any of these items individually I would get a mild upset stomach however one day my mom gave me bananas and kiwi cut up on a plate for a snack. After eating most of it i had shortness of breath and hives on my chest. I knew I was having an allergic reaction and needed help.

1	I have broken one bone in my life, my collarbone. When that happened I knew what it was and went to the dr and followed their advice of using a sling and taking pain medication at the specified intervals. They also said they donât often reset broken collarbones anymore cause there wasnât much evidence of them healing better by doing that and it causes a lot of pain to reset that bone so we didnât reset it.

-1	"Experience is the knowledge or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.[1] Terms in philosophy such as ""empirical knowledge"" or ""a posteriori knowledge"" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an expert. The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge: on-the-job training rather than book-learning."
1	I have always been interested in health and medicine. I believe healthy living starts with the nutrients (food) you put in your body. Exercise and a healthy lifestyle in general is important to health success.
1	I smoked for many years. I decided I wanted to be healthier so I quit smoking and began training for a 10 mile run. I new if I didn't make changes to my life style, I would not live a long healthy life.

1	Those were tough at the end. I really got most of my knowledge from my schooling. I was going to go as a pharmacist but ended up just going for biology and chemistry. I also have had some severe stays in the hospital upwards of a month from my brain injuries and I worked in a hospital for a year.
-1	I basically read and studied any material that I have come across on medical issues and diseases. It's crazy how you are more knowledgeable than some mainstream doctors. 
1	I go to the rheumatologist on a regular basis and she is always telling me the likelihood of worsening conditions in percentages.  I find it easy to understand this info fairly easy.   
1	After having gallbladder surgery, I was still having bowel issues.  I researched online and found what the problem was and what could be done to remedy.  I made and appointment with my doctor and described, and he prescribed the medicine and it took care of the problem.
1	In high school, I did my health presentation on atherosclerosis and that taught me a lot about causes of plaque build-up and how the body manages it through a mixture of LDL and HDL fats. It was a half hour presentation and I used visualizations on a computer to illustrate the process. That project also showed me how I could use better sources of information that were available to me, like Nature and Scientific American to get a detailed understanding of health processes.
-1	I work in healthcare so I practice my knowledge for health and medical issues on a daily basis it is my passion and Iâm very proud of my work field.
1	My daughter has Chiari 1 Brain Malformation. We've been to many different emergency rooms and doctors offices where the staff and doctors were not familiar with her condition. We have had to educate many doctors and healthcare workers about Chiari and how it is treated. 
1	One morning I woke up and felt extremely lightheaded. It was a hot summer day and I had not been drinking much water that week. I nearly fainted when I went to go use the bathroom. I figured occurred  because of the extreme heat and because I had been so dehydrated during the week. I immediately got me a cold glass of water and put on lighter garments. I allowed myself to sit and rest and made sure I had drunk plenty of water throughout the day. I did not have any other episodes like this since.
1	When I went to a doctor last year about painful anal fissures and haemorrhoids, I was already pretty well informed about them. This was due in part to having researched them in the past, both in how they relate to poor diet and how they can be caused or exacerbated by anal sex. I already knew going in that these would take a long time to heal, so I didn't expect a quick recovery. Furthermore, I was able to ask better clarifying questions during my appointment due to my prior knowledge, which helped me understand what I needed to do as well as diagnose the cause more quickly.
1	I went a course on how to provide cpr to a paitient no I am ready for when ever anything happens to one of my family members in order to administer CPR. I know that it can revive someone having a heart attack, and my father has had a heart attack so just in case it happens again I can bring him back to life again. I also spend a lot of time with my grandmother so it will be very useful to know this knowledge beforehand just in case anything happens. I highly recommend everyone taking a CPR course and learning about what it can do for people in danger.
1	I have diabetes II. I met with a nutritionist who taught me how to eat right to keep my blood sugar levels good. I learned what to buy & eat. She was right. When I eat the right foods my blood sugar is great.

1	I was poisoned with palytoxin. I was hospitalized for two days. The whole toxicology came down and thought I was bit by a lionfish when in fact I was poisoned by zoanthids. I had a terrible reaction, I got hives, every part of me started swelling and I had a hard time breathing. I learned a lot about what they had to do in order to treat me.
1	A doctor gave me a prescription and said to take a certain amount of mg for 10 days. The math did not add up. I would have needed another full bottle to fulfill the directions. I called and was told that I needed a second bottle for my prescription
1	I can't honestly think of any situation like this, I rarely go to the doctor or have any medical problems. I suppose just knowing that a pain in a certain spot on my back could be a kidney stone counts but I only know that because I've had one.
1	I have had two prostate surgeries. From speaking with my PCP, the surgeon, and my own research, I went into them knowing what to expect. There were no surprises. Although the first was successful, I was in the low percentage group that had recurrence and required additional surgery. That was successful and I have not been bothered since.
1	Most recently, our newborn was having mucous and traces of blood in her stool, and because of our prior experience with our first child, we knew right away this was an allergic reaction to dairy/soy protein in my wife's breast milk.  We cut dairy and soy out of her diet and she perked right up in a few days and her stools normalized.  
-1	I was studying to be a massage therapist and a client came in with serious back problems. They asked me what muscles I would work out and if I could help address the issue and possible fix it. I had to learn anatomy to be able to work on clients so I worked on a specific muscle group I had learned about in class and they felt much, much better after I had worked on them. It definitely helped learning anatomy, otherwise I would be of no help to anyone.
-1	An experience would be when I was younger my mother was hospitalized and during that time my dad was living in a different country. He was not able to be here with us because of money issues, so I had to care for her for over a year and I had to learn how much medicine she had to take and every how many hours. When I would take her to her doctors appointment I had to make sure that the doctors knew that she was allergic to a few medicines so that they wouldn't prescribe her those and I had to memorize the medicines that she was already taking. This expanded my knowledge on medical issues and health. 
1	I had a friend/coworker who had a peculiar change in some patterns that I noticed. He was using the bathroom more often and constantly refilling his water bottle throughout the day. We are software engineers, and he also complained about issues he was having while typing on the keyboard, which he attributed to repetitive stress. I have family members who have had diabetes and suggested that he might want to see a doctor, as some of the issues mentioned above are symptoms. It turns out that I was correct and he is now receiving treatment for it.
1	Prior to my first spinal fusion, I had a list of questions for my doctor. He was surprised at the amount of research I had done in order to be informed. I asked specific questions about the XLIF procedure that he had proposed and what the difference in recovery times and success were in relation to other procedures. I asked specifically where the bone marrow would be drawn from in order to create the fusion. We had a great discussion and he was happy to answer what he referred to as very intelligent questions.
-1	I just had an xray done on my back to see if my scoliosis has worsened, i now have a double curved. It's still not bad enough to do surgery but they recommend physical therapy or it may worsen over the next 5 years. Knowing the risks, I can't afford physical therapy sadly, but if it gets bad enough my insurance covers surgery.
1	I am an American Heart Fellow. I did a fellowship in a department of medicine and was a research-track faculty in a medical school. I have been a part of two cancer centers (within academic institutions).

1	I had gotten strep throat many times growing up.  I became familiar with how the illness felt and I can now identify when I am getting it.
1	I have to stop smoking since it might cause me to get lung cancer. I exercise regularly.  I eat healthy food. I have a medical checkup regularly.
1	I had a mammogram a few years ago and I had to come back because my breast where dense and they were not sure what they were reading. I had to havce a different test and everything was ok, they just needed a baseline.

1	One time, a friend of mine got sick. I went over to check on him and make sure he was okay and was able to get him to feel better by buying the right medicine, food and liquids he needed. That is about as much knowledge as I have and if I needed more, I'd have sent him to the doctor.
1	There was a time where I was having serious sleep issues and problems keeping my energy level up. I pretty quickly identified it as not normal and that I needed to get it looked at, and was able to see a doctor for it. I was able to get a diagnosis for hypothyroidism to help with my energy problems.
1	When I was younger I  lost a lot of weight by researching the right foods and a good exercise routine, ( i have since put the weight back on). I looked up all the right foods to help with different things and was able to clear up my acne and lose a good deal of weight and well as increase my strength and stamina. I also help other member of my family get into better shape
1	As a teenager, I was correct in telling my mother to go the hospital based on her appearance. It turned out her blood pressure was dangerously high and she ended up being admitted.

1	I volunteered as an ambulance worker in a conflict zone several years ago. We had to deal with injuries from bombings in the immediate aftermath and pick up of the people to be transported back to the hospital. I have no medical training, but I learned how deal with traumatic wounds, bleeding, concussions, and how to triage effectively. I also learned how to administer painkillers and tie tourniquets properly.  
-1	I am very sorry but this questions seems repetitive, I already gave an information that I do know how to demonstrate knowledge about health issues, so that in turn would tell you that every time I visit my physician I DEMONSTRATE knowledge always.
-1	it all started in high school  there  were  diffrent courses tooken and it just stuck with me all my life and by seeing what others have gone through .ive done alot reasearching on diffrent topics so i have better understanding about this stuff and had a gpa 4.0 3 years i got that from my mom..plus i know my diagnoses were .lots medical dental.oh heart condction ,athsma ....
1	I had a severe stabbing pain in the lower right side of my abdomen. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before, and left me literally doubled over in pain crying. I had a suspicion it was a kidney problem. I went to urgent care and they said, no it's nothing, just take an antacid. Less than 5 hours later, the pain was completely unbearable and I almost fainted while waiting at the ER. Sure enough, I was about to pass a large kidney stone and had an infection of my kidney as well. I was admitted overnight, given 3 bags of IV antibiotics, and a mild painkiller or antiinflammatory to hold me over while the stone passed.
1	I had a hunch that I was a test subject for a certain rare disease and had to go through a lot of hoops because I couldn't exactly pinpoint what was wrong with me, it included a colonoscopy at age 21 and various other random bullshit since I had no idea what was wrong with me. I learned about various random problems and diseases that may have been unrelated until I eventually dropped everything and continued to live my life as if I didn't have any of those problems. Usually a doctors visit is really simple but I had one that made me rethink my health choices for a couple years in various ways. The disease was called PNH.
-1	I knew that i had something wrong with my uterus so i went to the doctors. They did a hysterectomy because i had a polyp as big as a grapefruit. They did a total hysterectomy because they weren't sure if it was cancerous.
1	I had kidney stones that I needed to pass, and I went to the hospital and told them that that's what I thought was happening.

1	reading of a ct scan of my lungs in search of cancers or other abnormalities and having the doctor explain the purpose and function of lymp nodes and what leads to calcification.
1	My doctor felt a lump on my right breast.  I had to get a mammogram, sonogram and have a biopsy. Then I had another mammogram.  I got a call a day later telling me it was benign and nothing to be worried about.  I did research and asked lots of questions to the doctor and nurse.
1	I worked as a health unit coordinator for 25 years up until 2014 when I retired. A main part of my job was to have an extensive knowledge of medical terminology. I have worked in various departments in a large city hospital ranging from telemetry, medical/surgical and maternity.
1	I have had a total thyroidectomy. I have had so many issues with trying to balance my medications. Everything relates to the thyroid. I never would have known all this information without going through this. 
1	I have had parents and siblings in the hospital a few times throughout my life, which has helped me gain experience speaking with doctors and nurses.
1	I was a CNA. I worked in a nursing home for a while. I have experience with my own health issues in the back.

1	I had major heart surgery in 2006 to repair an aortic aneurysm, replace an aortic valve, and install a pacemaker.  Within a month of exiting the hospital, I suffered a DVT and had a bout of ventricular tachycardia.  After 12 years of ongoing monitoring and medication, I have gained a significant knowledge of the state of my own health.  I have also had other surgeries, and currently suffer from an arthritic damaged knee that needs replacement.  At sixty five years old&lt; I guess it is just the cumulative knowledge that a person gains through these experiences which has added to my health knowledge.
1	After much research and review of my symptoms, I was fairly certain that I had multiple sclerosis. Soon after that, I was officially diagnosed with the disease.
1	A few years ago I was experiencing a lot of pain, swelling and redness in one of my legs. I was knowledgeable in symptoms and causes of blood clots and that they can be deadly if not treated immediately. I went to the ER and I was correct that I had a blood clot in my leg.

1	I went with my dad to a doctorâs appointment because he has high cholesterol. The doctor told him that he needed to lower his cholesterol to a certain level. After we left the office my dad looked at the results of his blood work and believed that his number was within the range of what the doctor recommended. I showed him that he was looking at the recommended amount and not the results of his test. His actual cholesterol was way too high. He would not have known that if i did not get with him

1	I started doing a lot of research when I started having children. So I became very aware of different remedies and modes of service out there.
1	I took the test to detect the presence of the prostate cancer antigen knowing the high probability of false positives.  I was prepared to consider not taking further action if the test came back positive unless further symptoms occurred.  The test was negative, so no decision need to be made.
-1	I used to take care of my grandmother. Her mind was starting to go and one day she started having really bad hallucinations and talking nonsense. At first, I thought maybe it was dementia, but then I remembered that strange behavior and hallucinations can often be a symptom of UTIs in the elderly. I called her doctor and was able to get antibiotics. 
1	There are none. You can require a minimum number of character if you want to but that doesn't change the facts. I have never had serious medical problems so my medical knowledge was never put to the test. I don't have any medical knowledge besides common sense in the first place.
1	Several early college classes tested us on human health and medical issues. I also studied psychology as my major, so if mental health counts, I graduated with a 3.5 GPA. I would say that my grade demonstrated an above average knowledge of health and medical issues.

1	After feeling very dizzy for several days I had tests done. My results came back showing nothing wrong. I knew I didnât feel right and while my dr said I was fine I pushed for more from him. 
1	While practicing jujitsu I have helped a fellow practitioner that was injured make a sling and gave advice on heating and icing practices. In most sports I have done I have helped people out when they receive injuries, as I have experienced most of them myself. 
1	An experience in my life that demonstrated that I have knowledge of health or medical issues is when I knew I needed mental health help and sought treatment for myself.
-1	I hurt my lower back quite badly, I knew that heat would relax the muscles to stop my back muscles from spasming so much, but its wouldn't help with the inflammation. So I decided to take ibuprofen for the pain but also because I know its a NSAID.  After the pain became more managable, I switched to acetaminophen since it would be easier on my stomach than ibuprofen. 
1	I listen and learn when I go to the doctor. I read information on the internet and what the doctors give me. 
1	I have taken a few classes on basic health and medicine.  I have regularly gone to the doctor all my life and have done quite a bit of reading on health and healthy activities.  
1	After I went through puberty, I started getting migraines every day. Since then, I have seen more doctors then probably most people will see in their entire lives. Not a single one took my concerns seriously.
1	I had a severe reaction to an antibiotic a few years go.  A few months after it happened, I filled out my paperwork at a specialist's office and marked that I was allergic to the drug.  I realized when they were printing out a prescription for me that it was the same drug I had put I was allergic to and pointed it out.
-1	For years I have had to take regular PSA tests to determine if I was susceptible to prostate cancer. I additon levels that have gone up and down, I had an enlarged prostate which is a problem in itself - it can affect one's lifestyle since going to the bathroom several times a night can lead to tiredness and other problems -  but not necessairly life threatening. My doctor originally put me on a medication that dealt with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate but being uncomfortable with certain medications (this one I would have to take forever), fearful about the cost and after effects, I took myself off after one bottle. To make a long story short, after two bladder stone surgeries, I eventally had TURP surgery to deal with the problems caused by the enlarged prostate and while it was painful, I do not have to take any life long medication to deal with any problems.

1	When I was due to give birth to my oldest daughter I was given the option of having her turned in-utero because she was breech presentation and I was a week overdue.  Because the Resident that I was dealing with told me there was only a 50% chance that the baby would stay head down until delivery and she had never done this procedure before, I chose to have a C-section the next day.  When my daughter was born, she was quite large and all agreed that my decision was the safest and most appropriate for the circumstances.
-1	I have read about mammograms doing more harm than good. I read about studies and made my own decision not to have one due to the false positives and stress that goes along with it.
1	My grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I learned a lot from spending time in the hospital and hospice with her.  I would ask the doctors what things meant in her chart so I had a better understanding of what they were doing,
-1	I was taken to the hospital not too long ago because I was having abdominal pain. The pain was so bad that I had actually fainted. The doctor discussed all the different reasons that I might be experiencing the pain.
1	When I had to talk to my mom about a rare lung disease she has. She doesn't know much about it and wasn't sure that she was getting the right treatment. I had to research it more, which I could do because I could understand what I was reading.
1	When my spouse got the flu, i knew that it would be mainly because my spouse didn't get the flu vaccine. By God's Grace my spouse got healed from the flu. I had some knowledge about the issues and symptoms that my spouse was dealing with and I was able to help at the right time.
-1	My daughter was sick. She was coughing and sneezing and had a temperature of 102.4. Even though she had a cough and sneezing, she was behaving normally. I gave her medicine to reduce the temperature. Later on she started to act very tired. I called the doctor and they said that she was probably fine and wanted us to come in the next day. Then she started to vomit. I took her to the hospital because of her symptoms and she had a stomach viris. i felt that something was wrong with her and i did not want to wait until the next day.
-1	When  I was experiencing pain in my jaw I instantly knew that it was an infection in my gums rather than the molar itself. I began to search for treatments and cleaned in between my gums and found a chunk of food that was causing the infection. I then cleaned my mouth with an antisceptic solution and the inflation went away in about a week.
1	I have been a type 1 diabetic since the age of 23. This has required knowledge of a number of different body systems and medical specialties, to maximize my overall health state.
1	The flu hit my family last week.  We had our flu shots so our fevers weren't extremely high (less than 101).  The accompanying symptoms were severe fatigue, cough, nausea and an extreme sore throat.  I was concerned because in the past my children have had atypical symptoms for strep throat (pain, nausea but no fever). However, I knew that a cough wasn't typical either.  I watched my son's throat for a few days and there weren't any unusual signs until last Thursday night when white spots started showing up.  At that point, my usual wait and see on a fever and cough symptoms turned into a doctor's appointment.  I've learned to wait out viruses but not to mess with what could be a possible strep.  Thankfully it wasn't strep but I knew what to look for and be concerned from past experience.  
1	I once treated myself for a sexually transmitted disease by ordering antibiotics I had looked up (by affect to body region). I found ciproflaxin for my bladder and urinary tract, and I found doxycycline for my STD health. After looking up how long a trial is of each, I was able to complete two weeks of dosing both. I then paid for a std test at my University Health Center and I tested negative twice, to which I was very happy. In my opinion you don't need a doctor, it's just 99% of people (including myself) will never share the same knowledge as one and medicine in it's concentrated forms can be very hard to dose and apply to select cases. I am glad doctors are around, as anything more complicated than the pills would be beyond me.
1	My son had a sinus infection as a child and was having trouble breathing and my wife and i weren't sure what to do.  I turned on the shower, brought him into the bathroom and shut the door.  The steam helped clear his sinuses so he could finally go to sleep.  My wife was happy. 
-1	My experience of knowledge about medical issues is related to a heart condition I have. I am knowledgeable in general about it and about the medication I take for it. I know what the medication is supposed to do and what effects it has on my body.
-1	Honestly I probably get the most knowledge from watching documentaries on health and medical issues. Also two of my siblings are nurses and another one is in nursing school, so I never here the end of medical issues.
1	I don't have much knowledge of health or medical issues, but I'm confident in my ability to figure out what I need to know when I need to know it, so I never worry about trying to figure medical stuff out ahead of time.
1	When my grandma had the symptoms of a stroke, I had to assess her and evaluate what was going on. I took her blood pressure, evaluated her speech, had to get her in a safe position, took her pulse, and called and explained to 911 and the EMTs. I had to explain everything to the nurses and doctors and my family at the hospital because she was unable to speak. I had to explain everything to several doctors as she was kept in the hospital for testing.  This also included knowing all her medications, dosages, times, routes. With the help of my descriptions, the doctors were able to correctly diagnose her with a likely causes. It was not a stroke, it was toxic encephelopathy.
1	I have virtually no knowledge of health or medical issues.  I once learned, in a community college course, how to do the Heimlich maneuver. I've never had any opportunity or reason to use it outside of that one instance though.

1	I have had eczema since I was a teenager, and I know that when I have a breakout that I can't control at home that the best thing for me is oral steroids. I have had doctors that have wanted to prescribe something else, but I usually insist that they give me the oral steroid.
1	All of my knowledge is done through the internet. With how the internet is today you can search anything and many accredicted doctors will have information on what these symptoms can mean. People can also post on forums who have had the same issues and they openly discuss them for the world to see and learn from.
-1	2 years ago i recieved my first mammogram.a couple days later they contacted me and i had to go in for another more intense one and also a sonagram. i was very upset of course until i read up on the subject and realized that it happened often to people the first time they get one.
1	I'm a personal trainer.  I train people daily on good health.  For example, i had a client today that was wondering about a diet.  I helped her get back on track by going over her intake 
1	well, I think this survey very much demonstrates my lack of health knowledge.  I can't figure the majority of these what % of people got false positives.  I just don't know.  I don't know that it really matters to me, the statistics of it all.
1	I tested positive for the hepatitis B antigen, so I was disqualified from giving blood. However, I know I did not contract hepatitis b, so I know it was a false positive, which can happen all the time with tests like that.
1	When I had my baby he had to stay in the NICU for 2 days. At first, I didn't understand exactly why, as it could have been a few reasons. It could have been because he had pooped before he was born so there was poop when my water broke. It could have been because I tested positive for Strep B. And it could have been because I had a fever during labor. I later figured out it was because of my fever.
1	I suffer from chronic migraines. I often found a significant tension in my neck when these headaches would occur. I suggested to my PCP that I might benefit from seeing a massage therapist. He agreed and we found the massage therapy would help alleviate the headaches some. 
1	I suffer from RSD and it originally started in my left arm and hand after surgery to repair a broken wrist.  Within 4 months of developing RSD in my arm my left leg started to swell and turn red and blotchy which is a indication of RSD.  My leg was also cold to the touch and very painful when touched which is a definite sign of RSD.  When I saw my pain specialist and he looked he would not believe that it was RSD because he did not believe it traveled, however after finding a newer board certified doctor in pain management he did diagnose this as the RSD traveling and also said it was not in the stage known as CRPS.  I trust my instincts and what my body tells me even if doctors may not agree. 
1	I was put on a new medication. When I picked it up I read the information sheet on it. I had some odd symptoms. I recocgnized them as side effects from te information sheet.

1	I look up the side effects to my own medications to ensure that I am not having any symptoms that could result in me having serious complications in the future. A lot of major issues with medication start as minor ones.I saved my own life about a year ago knowing these signs. If I had waited any longer to go, or did not notice the symptoms, I would have died. 
1	My daughter fell off of a scooter and cut her leg open. There was a lot of blood pouring out onto the concrete. I knew that I needed to apply pressure to get the bleeding to stop and get her to immediate care as quickly as possible. She got 5 stitches in her knee.

1	I have always believed to have reactive hypoglycemia. Doctors always told me I have low blood sugar but not as bad. Yet I lived with the risks and symptoms all my life. Finally 3 months ago after having a bad symptom, I found a doctor willing to do all the tests possible (unfortunate for me financially). He finally confirmed I have reactive hypoglycemia. And a lot of other health concern no other doctor informed me about before.
1	There is not many experience where I had to deal with knowledge of health or medical issues. At times I have to read nutrition labels, or sometimes in college classes I must execute hypothesis testing where the scenario is often a new drug attempting to fall below the 0.05 p-value threshold
1	I don't have any specific examples, any knowledge I have about issues are ones that I relied on the medical community for, I don't spend any time on these things because I don't want to think about the negatives.

Also everytime I've switched doctors, I didn't have transferable records so I have to to recount details of my diagnosis. 
1	My mother had lung cancer and eventually was diagnosed with diabetes due to chemo and eat habits. My mother was not used to her new diagnosis so her sugar levels were up and down. From what I learned in school I was able to help her with trying to get it under control.

1	Any time I try to explain neurological disorders, every face goes blank. I try to break it down even further and make it more simplified, but it seems as though thinking on that scale of body processes is something most people I've come across just can't grasp. Most do not understand the ties between injury, fever, swelling, neuron misfires, cerebro-spinal fluid, etcetera. I have to know theses things due to personal medical history..
1	I was sick, and I knew I was sick. I didnt have the ability to go to the doctor right away, but knew that I needed to because my illness wouldnt go away. I believed I had a bacterial infection. When i finally got to the doctor a couple weeks later, he said I had a bacterial infection and gave me the medicine to clear it up.

1	My partner's dog tore her dewclaw and it needed to be bandaged while it healed.  After some time of bandaging, it still wasn't healing very well.

My mother asked me to design him a meal plan because he does not eat as he is told and as such gout is an issue he deals with regularly. I worked with him and, based upon my knowledge of how to eat with and treat gout, designed a meal plan with food that he likes and was agreeable to eating. This made a noticable difference in his gout symptoms and issues.
1	A coworker was injured on the job. I have first aid training, I was able to assist them with their wound until medical personal arrived.
1	Probably the area where I know the most about medical issues is in terms of sexual activity. In college, I had to write a couple papers about the issue of sexual education, so I did plenty of research on the subject of STDs or teenage pregnancy. This is probably where I gained a lot of knowledge of health.
-1	I developed a blood clot in my twenties. When I walked into the ER I explained that I had a DVT due to the birth control pills I was taking. I had read the insert and I was correct.  
-1	I have had a problem with weight gain since my 2 pregnancies. I am aware that I have higher weight, higher cholesterol, and higher blood pressure as a result of this weight gain. I am aware of 2 main causes - 1) unhealthy eating 2) not having time to exercise. Because I am aware of the risks, I decided to try to eat healthier and exercise more.
1	My dad had a massive stroke 10 years ago and my mom and sister were in complete denial about what was happening.  They wanted me to help get my dad to his feet because they thought if he started walking he would be ok.  I recognized immediately what was happening and called 911. My dad lived but he was never the same again.  His doctor showed us a brain scan that showed only a quarter size area of damage in his right brain.  It's scary that a quarter size area of damage could change someone's entire personality.
1	I went to the hospital complaining about light headiness.  The doctor told me that I had Hypertension.  He told me to diet and exercise before he considered prescribing me medication.  Ultimately my blood pressure returned to normal after following a stricter diet with exercise.
1	The last time I went to the doctor, I had strep throat. I was being checked up on and I needed to fill out paperwork at the beginning of my visit detailing some of my medical history and needs. This went smoothly.
-1	I work in a specialized and private hand clinic. Sometimes when patients come up to the window complaining of hand pain and such, I can instantly diagnose their disease. Of course, I don't have the license to clearly diagnose them and give them medical advice without an official diagnosis so I wait until the doctor can.
1	In general, I would just mention that I help certain family members with their own medical and health needs. This could include doctor visits, completing paperwork, understanding how to take medication, etc.
1	A couple years ago I was discharged from the ER suffering from abdominal pain, and other weird symptoms like high blood pressure, and no insight really given as to what was causing this given by doctors. On my own, I was able to figure out that diverticular disease was leading me to experience eventual high blood pressure, and that it got worse the more that I ate, so I could avoid this by fasting when I began to have these kinds of symptoms. That's more than the doctors figured out, maybe I should be a doctor.
1	I have taken many courses on biology and health in general. I think that I know a decent amount about health care.
1	Over the past two years I have had two major broken bones through falls. In those experiences, my knowledge of health and medical issues, specifically related to bone and muscle healing and development, but also on a larger scale, have increased a great deal. 
1	One thing that comes to mind is the fact that I show up each year for an annual physical.  While this seems like a small thing to many, people who think they are healthy should be getting annual checkups because you really can't always tell.  Even if you work out religiously and eat an extremely healthy diet, it's still vitally important to check in and make sure everything is actually okay inside of you.
1	I have to go back to my osteogenesis imperfecta again as having lived with it for over 60 years now, it is what I know best about my own body.   It takes very little for me to fracture. At times I get what are called spontaneous fractures.   Medical professionals who are not particularly familiar with OI can't believe how little it takes for me to get a fracture nor do radiologist always understand that what I often get are tiny hairline fractures which are hard to see.  Thus I can be diagnosed as not having a fracture when I actually do.  I have to know enough to listen to my own body in those cases.
1	I don't know if it's really knowledge, because I did have to research to be sure and still go to the doctor for verification and treatment, but a few months after my daughter's birth I started having breast pain and woke up one night with terrible chills and fever. I thought it might be mastitis (I was breastfeeding) and after some reading online, found the symptoms sounded right. I went to urgent care, confirmed my suspicions, and got some antibiotics.
1	Taking a course during college for food safety and illness prevention. We took numerous tests, courses and had information about the illnesses people can get from raw food, improper food handling and cross contamination. I am also knowledgeable out items that carry common bacteria from food and food items, since it was meant to keep the workplace, work areas and preparation clean to prevent any issue that may occur during cooking and serving guests.
1	I am a testicular cancer survivor of 15 years. I had to make a choice between surveillance, chemotherapy, and adjuvant surgery (after initial tumor removal).

I did the chemotherapy and got my butt kicked.

1	I had a skin cancer scare a few years ago and met with quite a few medical professionals to see what procedures were necessary and what were elective. I had to do a lot of research on my own to ensure I was receiving the accurate information from the doctors. I needed to be my own patient advocate.
1	I was feeling very sick for a few days straight. I knew that it was very likely strep throat but other people kept telling me it was the flu. I read up some more online and finally went to the doctor. He did a strep test and was able to confirm that I did have strep. 
1	A couple years back I went to the dermatologist, but prior to that I did a lot of background search on what derms do and what they can provide for a patient. I already got a good understanding what they would prescribe me and therefore I knew how to take the prescriptions and what some of the side effects were going to be. I did end up getting what I thought I would so it really helped me out.
1	A year ago I had a false positive mammogram and had to go through so many test including a biopsy to get the final results.
1	I usually research in internet when I find a health problem. After that I go to the doctor's office. Most of the times my research has given the correct result.

-1	My son was diagnosed with fever seizures. I understood that when he had a fever that I had to watch out for this to happen.

-1	Last year, I had a bout of diverticulitis. I had never suffered with it before, but I knew there was a possibility that it may show up. So I read on line, everything about the stomach, and knew that was it.
-1	I don't have an experience that demonstrated my knowledge on health or medical issues. I am always reliant on a medical official (doctor or nurse) to help me understand what is wrong. Short of colds, cuts and scraps I am not a professional and don't expect to understand what they know. I can tell the difference between a sprain or pulled muscle and something much worse but past that i do not have much experience.
1	My boyfriend was concerned about some sleep issues.  I gave him some advice about getting more sleep, staying away from computers and finding a different hobby other than playing on his phone.  Yesterday at an appointment with his doctor, the doctor gave him the exact same advice and in fact said, your girlfriend was right. 
-1	i went to get my eyes checked and i stated that the white stuff in my eye was drusen. The doctor was astounded that i knew what the term drusen met.
1	I think my level of experience is pretty common for a regular person. I think i learn more every time i go to the hospital, i get sick or anybody in my close circle gets sick. I also enjoy watching different tv programs that teach you more about how to take care of yourself. I also read a lot of articles online about healthy lifestyle. I took few classes about healthy cooking and nutrition   
-1	As I had said or described previously, through my experience I have been able to learn only the basics for medical cases. For example, a while ago I had some problems with my heart. These problems made me understand that I should drink a lot of water, always avoid strong emotions or dislikes. I understood that I could feel thanks to the problem in the heart dizziness and desire to vomit
1	I have a daughter and she developed a skin rash on her legs.  I took her to dermatologist and the dermatoglist said that she had allergies and prescriped a wide variety of medicines for treatment.  But I did research on the diagnosis and my daughter's problem simply didn't appear to be what was described online.  As a result, I took her to a regular doctor who diagnosed her differently and we used the medicine prescribed and the problem cleared up within a week.
-1	Hereditary issues arise in my family ranging from heart disease to thyroid. The thyroid issue can be affected at any age but the heart issues are later like menopause age, so i know what i can and can not help or try to minimize at best.
1	I learned first-hand about the side effects of cancer treatment (chemo, radiation, surgery).  I learned about the various treatments (CT scan, Pet Scan, external and internal radiation, surgery, transfusions, chemo).
1	Probably when my step dad was complaining about a growth on his face. I have run across information in the past about skin cancer and immediately told him he should get that checked out.

-1	i have studied some medicine. i also have had many family members with different health conditions so i like to study up on as many conditions as possible to stay ahead of any symptoms
1	I had a lump in thigh and looked up information on the lump and found a picture of it on the Internet. The lump is a lipoma (or fatty tissue that grows after an injury).  I got lucky and was correct.  The doctor told me what I had.
-1	I had an issue with my arm feeling numb and could not use it for a few days. I went to the doctor thinking that is could have been a stroke. They ran tests and put my arm in a sling. I had read up on strokes and saw news stories online regarding strokes. 
1	I had been put on a new medicine by a new doctor that I didn't really think I needed to be taking from what I had read. She was a very new doctor and I wasn't sure she really knew what to do. The next year when I went for my annual checkup, I saw an older doctor that had been practicing for years and he immediately said that there was no reason that I should be taking that medicine and I should stop. He tried to explain to me the reasoning thinking that I would be against stopping but I told him that I had thought the exact same thing.
-1	My mom has lots of health issues. I have worked in a couple offices that dealt with the same problems she has so I am able to help my mom understand better what her doctors telling her. When she does not completely understand or even believe what the doctors are saying are correct she can call me and I can tell her if Ive ever dealt with that before. Even though I do not have a lot of knowlegde about medical conditions I seem to know more then a lot of friends and family do. Also, as I'm sure most people use Google to search medical terms or symptoms. I search google for everything so that helps me help others and myself undersand medical stuff. I do know most doctors hate for their patients to search google for medical conditions. With that said most all medical conditions have the same symptoms as other conditions so we should  only take what we find on google or even hear from friends and family very lightly and make sure to always speak with a doctor. 
-1	During a recent visit, I was able to inform my doctor of a unbeknownst-to-her documented side-effect relating to wellbutrin.

I didnt at the time know what that was until that day. I had extremely high BP.  I had to have blood transfusions and platelets.  I had to make sure from that point on I watched my intake of fatty foods so my liver would not be affected.  I have learned what fatty liver really is.  My dr test my blood now to make sure my liver is in the normal levels.  
1	I have given advice to a lot of friends who have mental illnesses since I suffer from depression and anxiety disorder.  I have also researched my parents medical issues and helped educate them or clear up any confusion they have about their conditions or the medication they are taking.  Having to have surgery 4 times also helped me learn a great deal and help others deal with the same medical issue that I have.
1	I was able to research my symptoms and have an idea of what questions to act the doctor when I went for my appointment.
1	My tenant informed me he was experiencing chest pains.  I called 911 and had him rest.  I checked his pulse to make sure it was strong.  When the fire department arrived, I made sure that they had his medications to take to the hospital with him.
1	Anytime I went to the doctor with my father.  I made sure to prepare myself by reading background material and understanding his history so I could walk into the office and make it clear to the doctor that I knew what I was talking about.
-1	Eating right is the key to good health. It's not a apple a day keeps the doctor away. It's eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and reduce your meat intake and exercise keeps you away from the doctors. 
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when someone claimed to have had the flu. I asked them what their symptoms were and based upon their answers, I concluded that they had a mere cold instead of the flu
1	I was able to get myself from 168 pounds as an adult to 215 pounds through diet and exercise. I was able to maintain a healthy blood pressure by monitoring my sodium intake. I was able to gain muscle by adjusting my caloric intake slowly so as not to gain fat while gaining muscle. Also dropped my LDL and raised my HDL through diet and exercise while gaining muscle through increasing protein and reducing carbohydrates. 
1	I think that the most beneficial experience that I have come across would be just learning how to read nutrition labels, and figure out what my daily intake should be. This has allowed me to learn how to control my weight. 
-1	I mean just talking to my doctor or reddit i guess. I never took classes and i know i didn't do that good. I think i'm a good example of a average joe.
1	Whenever i have issues with my health, i will often do my own research prior to seeking medical advice. Most of the time, if you look into certain things from reliable sources, you can find that most common health related issues can be alleviated on your own without an external help. 
-1	When I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis I was not given much instruction on how to deal with it on a daily basis other than to take drugs that had terrible side effects. I began to take the blood test and scopy tests results and learn what each thing meant. I went and got a blood review done and was able to see my cells and learn what the shape and distribution of my cells in the vial mean. I started to change my diet drastically and began taking natural substances such as aloe and ginger to reduce inflammation. Now I have problems still but I can better balance with the chart information and finding resources online I can go to the health store and try and help myself naturally.
1	I was primary caregiver for my parents for 10 years before their deaths.  We were constantly at Doctors and hospitals with Alzheimers, MS, Parkinsons, Heart disease, Diabetes, etc.  
1	I was once out camping in the wilderness with some friends and had been drinking quite a lot. We were cutting up firewood with a saw when my friend sliced his leg open pretty bad. Knowing the alcohol had thinned his blood and the size of the wound we immediately started with first aid of a tourniquet using one of our belts. Foolishly we had no real supplies for cleaning the wound besides vodka, which I knew was better than nothing. After cleaning the wound up it was clear this would not stop bleeding without some sort of suture. We decided to use a cotton strip of shirt over the cut and some duct tape to seal it shut. This held up well until we were able to make it to the hospital for some stitches. 
-1	In all honesty, I can't describe such an experience, because I DON'T have a great knowledge of health or medical issues.  I'm not a doctor, or even a med student. The only account I can give you is when I broke two of my fingers at work (due to a rolling machine accident).  The doctor said that he'd have to burn a hole through one of my fingernails.  I immediately understood why... it's a common practice to prevent clotting and swelling of that area. Sorry folks, that's it.  That's all I can think of.
1	I was able to significantly lower my blood pressure by changing my diet to mostly vegetables and fruits. As well as avoiding red meat.
-1	My wife likes to claim that she has cancer every time she feels sick. I keep telling her that she has 0 signs of having cancer, and that she just worries way too much about it. 
1	Both of my parents have had serious health issues. I have been to many doctors appointments, and I have met with many of their surgeons over the years. I have listed to and understood what we being explained to me.
1	An experience that has demonstrated my knowledge of health issues is when I researched foods online, such as which vegetable are in the dirty dozen each year (have the most pesticide danger), so I know which vegetables should always be bought organic and which not so much.
1	A few years back, I fell hopelessly dizzy and could not stand upright for a few days. The spinning was also came with a loud ringing in my left ear which also left me partially deaf. After doing some research online, I came to discover that the ringing in my ears was called tinnitus and that there are stones in my ears that are responsible for equilibrium that I must have knocked out of whack.
1	When my mother in law (age 99, had a heart attack 20 years prior) complained of a sore shoulder and nausea, and her feet turned blue, I suspected that she was having a heart attack. It turned out that I was correct - she had a massive coronary and went into full arrest. 
1	The most relevant evidence that I have experience that demonstrates my knowledge of health or medical issues is not only my many years of taking care of my personal health matters through the health system, but also my having successfully graduating with my Emergency Medical Technician certificate.  I have also interned in an emergency room for some time and have two years of premed education in college.  
1	I think that the fact that I always stay on top of my health and I continue to read about health in general helps me in a positive way. I try to be in control of any symptoms I might have and to research things as much as possible so that I remain healthy. 
1	I do not have a relevant experience that has occurred during my life that would demonstrate knowledge of health or medical issues.
-1	I have had a gastric bypass with many complications.  I have had surgery, multiple procedures, medications and lifestyle changes.  Using all of these, and the information I have been given, I am able to manage these problems.
1	When I went to see my most recent psychiatrist, I not only described my symptoms to her but also told her the kind of medications that I wanted to take. I had already studied a lot about my potential illnesses and what would be most helpful, and she prescribed everything I requested. I was at my most stable point after that, all because I gave my own input and knowledge about what was right for me.
1	My mother-in-law was running a fever of 104 and I noticed she wasn't very coherent so made sure she went to the ER as soon as possible. I made sure someone stayed with her at all times since she was not 100% coherent.
1	I took my godmother to the emergency room for a mild chest pain, which was her compliant at the time. After reading the emergency test results and medicines prescribed, I was able to understand what her underlying medical issues are, which was proved right when we later visited her regular doctor as she explained everything to us. 
-1	A time where I was presented with the knowledge of health or medical issues was when I was at the clinic with my doctor who explained to me the problems that I had with my health.
-1	I try to exercise, walk and eat healthy. I try to make foods that are good for me.  I try to take to my doctor about all the things I can do to make my life easier and healthy so I can live a long time
1	"My sister was having severe pain in her lower leg, for no apparent reason. She was a smoker at the time. I suggested she go to the ER because it could be serious. She declined, because it was ""just leg pain."" She was in ICE 2 days later for a pulmonary embolism. The leg pain had been a blood clot. It broke free and went to her lungs. It could have killed her. Had she gone in when I suggested, things would have been much better for her ."
-1	I am an ultrasound tech for my profession.  I had a pt that had experienced sudden weight loss, new onset diabetic and several other symptoms that were side effects of pancreatic cancer.  I scanned her pancreas and found a mass in the head.  I took the information to the radiologist and he did not agree.  I went above him and took the info to the physician and he tested specifically for it and foudn it to be positive for panc ca
1	When I was in the jungle in Thailand with three other people, we spent several nights with tribal people.  On the first night, the woman whose hut we were staying in had a very badly broken arm.  She had broken it a couple of days earlier.  Pierre and I talked about it and agreed to clean it up and set it together, knowing that she would probably get gangrene and die if something wasn't done.  
-1	Most employers are concerned about worker safety since injuries or other workplace incidents can impact productivity, morale, and insurance rates, while also leaving the organization
1	I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when my daughter got sick. I took her temperature and gave her cold press to relieve her pain. I also gave her probiotics and other good food to make her feel better.
1	I am familiar with the symptoms and numerical glucose values of diabetic persons who are beginning to have an insulin reaction so I was able to tell when a young boy I knew was in this situation though no one else around him was aware of it. This allowed me to react quickly, grab his blood sugar test kit and test his blood to see if the situation was an emergency.
-1	I don't really have experience except from reading online and luckily I've only had two medical issues, both having to do with my kidneys. I've learned from the doctors and WebMD about supplements and dietary adjustments that would decrease my risk of kidney stones. Otherwise, I really do not have much knowledge on medical issues.
1	When my grandmother was sick, I was two years removed from college and working in a lab.   This made is much easier to help her and my father when going over options for medical decisions
-1	I had my appendix taken out a few years ago. I had a lot of paperwork and discussions with my doctor and the surgeon.
1	I had a baby two years ago by c-section.  I was able to understand the explanations of why this was medically necessary and agree to it. I also was discharged with material that contained instructions about caring for myself and my son post-partum, and I had no trouble understanding the material I was given.
1	I used to be a certified nurses assistant at a past job over 20 years ago. Therefore, I received lots of knowledge while I was working with Licences Practical Nurses's and Registered Nurse's and taking care of geriatric patients on a daily basis at my past job. 
1	I'm not really sure, probably when I got tested for thyroid problems because I did a bunch of research beforehand. It turned out that I did not have any abnormal thyroid condition.
1	I can't think of a specific acute experience but my mother taught me how to read a nutrition label, count calories, and assess whether said calories are empty or nutritional. I could just do better at following that info. 
-1	I needed to get a blood transfusion for and ulcer. I wasn't sure how bad it was but relied on my knowledge and common sense to get myself taken care of.

1	I noticed spotting after menopause and knew that it could be serious so I went in for a check-up.  I did have an issue and it was caught in time.
-1	When I was given my lab results while in the Drs office I asked them before I looked at my copies if everything looked good and the nurse said yes everything is perfect so I looked over the reference ranges on all tests done. I found 3 blood tests that were flagged as abnormal and one was really low compared to what the reference range showed for Vitamin D and I was very deficient on paper. I told the DR my findings and he said ohhh just go out in the sun more. Well I talked to a nurse practitioner about it on a follow up appt and she put me on Vitamin D3 supplements for 3 months and I really felt so much better after my level was up. 
1	I eat fruit and vegitables all the time. Because of this I never get sick it seems. I think washing my hands helps too.
-1	When I was in school, I got sick sometimes, and would have to see the doctor. I also had to do a lot of problems like this in school.
1	The only experience I have is my own when I've gone to the doctor or read about certain things.  Other than that I have no experiences that would demonstrate my knowledge.
1	My first child was born premature. He was in the NICU for a month. During that time I learned, mostly through repeated exposure, how to read a lot of what was going on around me. For instance, I could tell if a baby nearby was have real bradycardia vs. a false brady by the sounds the alarms made.
1	I had an unusual mole on my shoulder.  It was the same color as my skin but was an unusual shape and just looked very odd.  I researched skin cancer.  I went to a dermatologist and hew was able to test it.  It was cancerous and I had it removed.  
1	I suspected that my son had autism at a very young age. When I took him to the pediatrician, he did not think that my son had autism and did not feel it was necessary to refer him for testing. I persisted and was able to get my son tested. My son was officially diagnosed with autism at the surprise of the pediatrician.
-1	My husband recently had an episode of CHF.  He's had heart disease for years.  The day he could no longer walk from one end of the house to the other, I knew he could no longer put off going to the hospital.
-1	When my mother started experiencing tension types of headaches, I suggest she try to work to loosen the muscles in her neck and shoulders to prevent these headaches. She began stretching each morning and the headaches stopped.
-1	I was certified for CPR a while ago.  I never actually had to use it but I was in a situation where I I was able to assist someone performing it and help remind them of the proper steps, etc to keep them confident.
1	I have made sure that my kids have all their vaccinations because I know that the chance of serious vaccination side effects is much smaller than the chance of getting a dangerous disease if you're not vaccinated.
1	An experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues was when I took a pre test in my health class in high school. I did well. I like studying health for fun.
1	I was a pharmacy tech student for over a year. We had tests on the subject and I did well, especially in medical terminology. I have been telling doctors for nine years about chronic back pain, and kept getting sent to do physical therapy which wasn't helping, they tell me I need to exercise and lose some weight but I actually have arthritis and 2 herniated discs shown by an MRI I finally talked someone into doing last year.
1	I have Multiple Sclerosis. One symptom I used to suffer from is extensive pain and numbness in my arms overnight. After extensive research I concluded that water fasting would help improve my condition. After 14 days of water fasting the symptom among many others has vanished.
1	Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with presumed ocular histoplasmosis. It was an emergency situation that I had to make a decision regarding my eyes by putting trust in the doctors. I asked my personal eye doctor a lot of questions and he was able to help me with my decision to have treatment on my eye.
1	I check my weight daily and some days it's increased substantially despite no real change in my diet. This seems to happen most often after I've eaten at a restaurant. Knowing that salty foods can cause the body to hold water for a longer period of time, I can conclude that restaurants use high amounts of salt in their foods and that shows up on the scale as increased weight from excess water in the body.
-1	I had an experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when I had a sonogram on my thyroid. I understood what I was told by my physician and why they wanted to do further testing, due to the results of the sonogram.
1	I knew that a loved one had a bowel blockage that needed to be addressed. It wasn't because the doctors only focused on the fact that that person had cancer. They refused to look at anything else. It was a hard battle to win.
1	An experience I had in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when I when my toddler daughter fell from a tree and cut her arm. She was frantic but I observed that the cut was relatively minor, was an isolated injury, did not appear to need stitches and there were no apparent breaks or rapid swelling. I soothed her tears by reassuring her as I cleaned her cut thoroughly and applied pressure to stop the bleeding. Then I applied a sterile bandage to the wound and walked her through some gentle range of motion maneuvers to verify that her wrist and elbow were unaffected. Since everything checked out OK, I determined that a trip to a physician was probably not necessary. I cleaned and dressed the wound, changed her bandage over the following week, and her healing progressed without incident.
-1	I have had wheezy breathing since I was a kid, but it was usually only when I was doing something particularly strenuous like hiking or riding my bike. When I got older, I did a good deal of research after experiencing bad wheezing while trying to get back into exercising again. I deduced that I likely had exercise induced asthma. I went to a doctor about it and they confirmed that it was that. 
1	When my daughter was little, she was prone to very high fever when sick, often over 104-105 degrees. I was aware that we were approaching dangerous territory.  Early on, doctors told us that we could overlap Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen every 4 hours because that would allow us to wait the recommended time between the same medication while shortening the time between medications.  We continued this practice, understanding that we were not exceeding recommended dosage, when she would have high fevers. 
1	My son was being evaluated by a cardiologist for a heart condition. The doctor was explaining to me that his pulmonary valve has stenosis and hence had a diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis. Because I had recently took a course in college on the heart and how it functions I knew what the word stenosis meant. I also knew the hearts structure and functioning. Without the course I took in college I probably would not have known these terms nor had an understanding how the heart functions or its structures. Because I had prior knowledge of the heart it made it much easier for me to ask questions of the doctor about the diagnosis. It made me feel more at ease when communicating with the doctor because I knew the basic medical terms when referring to the heart. 
1	My cadets used to have breathing problems occasionally when we would exercise. Sometimes they passed out. It was my duty to help them stabalize.
1	When my dad was diagnosed with kidney cancer, we both talked about the face that his 1 year survival rate was only about 15%. Particularly interesting was the fact that he had a rare form of kidney cancer and his next door neighbor died of the same cancer a few decades before making us wonder if there was an unusual cluster happening.
1	Recently had a rare winter snow storm in south La. and power was out for days, it was very cold. I knew I would get sick my lungs do not adapt to drastic fast changes in temps. Couple of days later I had a burning sensation in my lung with cough and congestion and a temperature. Called and got in to see my dr and I had pneumonia., I knew what it was before I went in. I pay attention to my body and am aware of my condition and what it means so I got in to the Dr quickly
-1	My experiences in knowledge of health or medical issues are better till now.I have no any serious diseases infecting my body.So far there has no signs of fatal deficiencies in my body. 
1	Often I don't know much about what is going on with me medically, once I get the results of blood tests or other diagnostic information is when I start studying and trying to understand. I once got pregnant while using an IUD and being on the pill. I had an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy at the same time. They always teach reproduction at the end of anatomy and physiology courses (6/6 times for me it was at the end) so it's usually rushed and cursory, so I needed the doctors to explain a ton to me. Like I didn't know that ectopic fetus' (feti?) don't grow at the same rate as intrauterine ones. Anyway, all the things I learned through that experience, like that I have a bicornuate uterus that makes my IUD less effective, were things I had to explain clearly to new health care providers as I have moved around.
-1	I was told I could possibly be at risk of not being able to have children when I went to the hospital a few years ago due to stomach cramping. I questioned them and they could not explain that to me. I asked why they thought that and if they had any proof and they could not. I told them they shoulndn't be telling people that. 
-1	I work with babies and children all the time. I had a baby come in one morning with a low grade fever and a white tongue. I immediately sent him back home with his mom, and told her he needed to go to the doctor that I thought he was showing signs of thrush. Sure enough, she got him an appointment, and he indeed had thrush. 
1	A few years ago, my youngest son, who was 7 at the time, was hit by a car.  He suffered a traumatic brain injury.  He was on life support and in a coma for 3 weeks. He then was placed in a rehab hospital for many more weeks.  I had to quickly learn what was happening around me, the machines, the medications, and the monitors.  Nothing existed outside of his hospital room.
-1	Being a nurse is obviously the most prominent example of demonstrating my knowledge of medical or health issues. Besides that, having children has been another way of demonstrating my knowledge. I have also had a few health issues of my own. 
1	When my girlfriend got very sick with some weird symptoms, I was able to tell her which ones were concerning and which ones were perfectly normal. 
1	There have been many times in my life where I was able to assess my medical problem myself and avoid a doctor's visit because I knew there was no danger and I merely needed to ride it out. At the end of last year, I correctly guessed that my oncoming symptoms meant I had contracted strep throat, so I visited a doctor immediately rather than suffer through that for weeks.
-1	I know when I am having trouble with my Cholesterol.  I know when I start feeling a certain way -- tired ect. that I am not treating it like I should be.
1	I don't know that I have many, just that I have have a few surgeries and regularly see a neurologist for migraines.
1	Within two weeks of each other I experienced a surgery to remove a lump in my breast and a procedure to remove a kidney stone. Within those two weeks, I learned a lot about my health and medical issues.
1	generally everytime I go to the doctor or er, because I've had biology and medical classes and know a thing or two
1	I went into my doctor to discuss my mental health options for anxiety.  I knew there was different classes of anxiety and depression medications, but I had a hard time figuring out what would be best for me.  My spouse had to help me figure out which would be safe for me so I don't have negative side effects like I had had before.  I couldn't separate the thoughts of the side effects to the physiological effects.  
1	I gave birth to my son at 23 weeks (17 weeks early).  During his NICU stay, the doctor was trying to explain to me what problems we were looking at long term for him (ex: Cerebral Palsy, blindness, lung problems) but, before the doctor could finish I was already listing all the different possibilities to him.  He was amazed at my knowledge of the all that was involved in my having my son so early.
-1	When my husband had cancer I had to learn a lot of information. He had issues that were never discussed with us about his long term problems from head and neck radiation.
1	My husband has diabetes and so i learned alot from him. I couple years ago my doctor told me that my blood sugar was borderline but i could reduce it by changing my diet. I was fully aware of what that meant and the implications of it and i knew fully what she was talking about and what to do
-1	I am starting mammograms and I ask my doc questions.  I have breast cance in the family.  I've already decided what I'll do if I'm diagnosed with cancer.  I'd rather go into doc office with information I've gotten.
-1	One such experience was when I helped to take care of a loved one who was sick. I knew by taking her temperature that she could be monitored more closely for signs of infection. For example if her temperature was above 100, she would have a fever and needed medical care because she might become septic.
1	We have three kids.  Without preventive measures, if one gets sick, we'll all get sick.  Any time one of them has vomiting or diarrhea, we take precautions by sanitizing everything by cleaning and spraying disinfectant and quarantining when  possible.  By taking these measures, I'm sure we've saved ourselves hours of agony.
-1	When my husband died and i had to give him cpr. Which i did till medics got there then they took over. Unfortunately he did'tn make it. I was thankful that i had learned cpr in my younger days and was able to  hellp.
1	 I fell and scratched my wrist in my front yard one morning. When I put my hand in my pocket about 2 hrs later I was shocked by the pain from my hand. My fingers were swollen and red in just a couple of hours. I went to the VA clinic and was told I must have had a sting because infection didn't occur as quickly as that. I went home and tried to rest but I realized I was feverish.  I went to the hospital emergency rooms and they immediately admitted me with a MRSA infection. I was told that had I followed clinic instructions I probably would not have lived.
1	My sister was describing pain in her abdomen,  After showing me where the pain was I told her she may have appendicitis.  After going to the hospital it was confirmed she had it,
-1	I worked in the medical related field so I talk to doctor regularly regarding the product we sell to them. Also we had a health issue with our family member so that forces me to learn more about medical terminology and consequences of having certain diseases. What to do in order to prevent it. Of course, nothing is 100% preventable but work towards it will help. Importance of eating habit, exercise. Regularly visiting doctors for the checkup. Same way regularly going for dental appointment are some of the few proactive tasks.
1	Just reading random articles and looking to understand more common health occurrences and illnesses beyond a generic understanding of what most individuals would have.
-1	experience in myr lifestyle that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues it's I'm alive, been to Dr. Have degree.

1	With the exception of minor things such as headaches, stomachaches, sore throats, colds and the flu, I am not sure if I ever have really demonstrated much knowledge of health or medical issues. 
1	My father was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis years ago and he had a very hard time being able to understand any of the information that he got. Since I had been in college taking medical and biological classes, I was able to break it down for him and help him make the decisions that he needed to.
1	I fell down a flight of concrete stairs once and got pretty banged up but felt OK to walk and did not immediately go to the hospital because I knew that I did not have a concussion. I knew to go to the hospital the next day as my neck was extremely sore and my hand had bruised severely, and I knew that I had at least one broken bone in my hand.
1	My son was diagnosed as having ADHD but did not show many key symptoms. I took him to different doctors after having done my own research. I believed he was mildly autistic and it was confirmed many years later that he has Asperger's Syndrome.
1	One time, I had to go to the dentist and ended up needing an antibiotic for an infection. I told them to give me Clindamycin instead of Erythromycin because I had previously had an infection that was resistant to Erythromycin and I was allergic to Penicillin.
-1	Learning how to eat properly, as a result of growing up terribly out of shape. This led to me learning about the dangers of meat and dairy, finding out which foods nourish and heal the body, as well as nutrients and supplements. 
1	My son was born with syndactyl (webbed toes) and his left hand was webbed also.  During that experience I did a lot of research in order to decide what to do for him.  We consulted with several different doctors and specialists.  (Part of that was due to us moving and having to find new doctors).  I felt pretty knowledgeable about his condition.
1	My mother has serious health conditions, and has had 8 major surgeries.  Her most recent 30 years have been rough (that's more than half of her life).  I learned a lot growing up with a sickly mother.
1	My grandfather suffered from a heart attack several years ago.  He was told to stop using tobacco after surgery and he could reduce his change of another heart problem by a significant percentage.  I helped him to understand how important it was to stop using tobacco.

1	When my husband had an iliostomy and I had to help him change it and had to deal with giving him IV meds and had to deal with dr and insurance companies and everything else as well as taking care of my two small kids.
1	When I was younger, I had contracted Mononucleosis. After I had completely recovered, I had developed lumps on my shins. Most people would automatically assume that they were shin splints, but I knew better. I met with one Dr. who diagnoses me with shin splints even though I told him that I was not an active person. I also showed him my research results which suggested that I had Erythema Nodosum, which is common after contracting Mononucleosis. That Dr. told me I was wrong, so I went to a Dermatologist instead who confirmed that I was absolutely correct.
-1	Brain Tumors a condition called Neurofibromatosis. Very serious. I have both and right now my daughter has one of these diseases. Also premature babies my first born was born at 25 weeks. At 1lb 3oz. Over 4 months in the hospital

1	I have Hypothyroidism.   I have been getting treatment for years.  I have normal numbers but still have symptoms.

I cleaned his ear, put medicine on it, changed the gauze, and closely kept an eye on him. I knew which medicine to use, and how often to use. Also, I knew how effectively to clean his ear and take care of the infected area. Soon enough, my dog got a lot better and now his ear infection is completely gone.
-1	There are many, but because I have a nursing background, most of my friends come to me for medical advice and to explain what the doctor told them.  Before I give any medical advice or explanations, I always ask if they have been to their doctor and what did he tell them.  
1	I broke my arm many years ago and was told I needed surgery to fix my arm.  When I reviewed the surgery the doctor suggested I realized that they wanted to put pins in my bones to hold them together and in turn it would dramatically reduce my range of motion in my arm.  I decided not to have the surgery and found a doctor who agreed to take a slow approach to healing my broken arm.  I spent nearly a year in various casts and my arm healed on it's own, with full range of motion.  Had I not taking the time and energy to research my arm and the suggested surgery, I may not be living the life I have now and my physical abilities would be reduced.
1	Wow, um. I guess when my son's piano teacher was diagnosed with the same breast cancer my best friend had just beaten the year before. I was able to point her to resources she needed, and helped her formulate questions to ask regarding her treatment. I learned a lot as my bff went through her treatments and reconstruction that was beneficial to my son's piano teacher. 
-1	actually in very difficult to understand simple read some terms and diagnoses, that's why I find it hard to understand and I need some to explain many times the diagnosis
1	I helped my dad take my grandfather to the emergency room when he was sick. The doctor told us what was wrong with my grandfather using medical terms. I understood this and told my dad in more simple words.
1	I had a liver transplant in 2003. Since then I have become the go to expert for the people I know on anything to do with the liver. Or any organ transplant. Or really any major surgery. Even veterinary questions. I really donât know that much about the medical knowledge behind liver transplants, but I can advise on how to approach the procedure, and what to expect to happen after the procedure (which is more important to the patient, anyway). I know I have been able to put some peopleâs minds at ease who have experienced a transplant, so that makes me feel good. In 2017 I had a kidney transplant, so now Iâm an expert on that, too.
-1	I believe that doctors are incompetent. Every experience I have had with an doctor has been miserable. There have been doctors that have told me I wasnât a virgin, steered me in the wrong way as far as medicine and about health decisions 
1	A friend began suffering from terrible migraines, but didn't want to go to the doctor. I asked him different questions to identify the cause, including whether he had any dental issues. He didn't see the connection, but admitted that he had an exposed nerve in one of his teeth. I suggested he stopped avoiding the dentist because that may be the cause of his migraines. Within a few days of going to the dentist, his migraines stopped.
1	I had a heart issue awhile ago and I went to the doctor about it. I had a few appointments with specialists for tests and it ended up being a benign issue that has mostly resolved at this point. I researched and listened to the doctors and they were correct.
1	I tried to use my math skills the best that I felt that I could to try and figure out the information presented.
1	I have a chronic endocrine disorder that I diagnosed myself based on research done in medical journals. I had been to a variety of doctors who missed the symptoms. Once I found out that the disorder sounded like me, I went to a doctor who confirmed the diagnosis through blood work and other testing. I might still be without diagnosis had I not been able to find it myself. 
1	I verbally walked a patient through what will happen during a cerebral angiogram from start to finish.  What they will experience and and to expect from the dr.'s.  I have had these before myself and i also schedule them.
1	I was a coach for many years and I would teach my athletes about proper diet, hydration, and exercising. I believed in helping the athletes be healthier and better conditioned to be able to handle sports and injuries.
1	I had a friend that I was helping out when I noticed that she was having problems. First it was just not being able to remember but then she couldn't add and that was not like this smart individual so I asked her a few questions and I told her she needed to go to the doctor right away.  I was right she had a brain tumor that was causing her trouble.
-1	well because of my health issues I was able to figure out my husband had diabetes and diabetic nephropathy and he was able to go to the doctor to get treated for it and he is doing much better
-1	About 15 years ago my primary physician was completing my annual exam and asked if I was experiencing any pain in my upper back.  I told her that I was aware of the curve in my spin but that I had attributed the discomfort that I was having from the years of pushing Z-racks at work. She prompted informed me of the medical term for the physical condition and recommended that I keep an eye on it.  She did send me to have xrays done to begin tracking.
-1	my experience is very little, but when i do a medical exam i read the results online after going to my doctor and understand all
-1	I was able to successfully nurse my bedridden brother who had suffered multiple injuries from a near fatal accident. I followed the doctors directions.
1	I can't be specific. However, I learned about edema in the hospital. I knew that this was a serious issue and could be life threatening. This information was instrumental in helping me to understand the facts of a condition. 
1	Apologies in advance if this isn't exactly the type of experience that you're looking for, but it's the only thing that I can think of that somewhat relates. Whenever I run across something that I don't know about (especially a health issue), I typically try to do as much research on it as I can. As mentioned before, I suffer from IBS. I tried to do what research that I could on my own, but I eventually had to cave and go to the doctor when it didn't seem to get any better (it's a good thing that I did, because I likely also had a stomach ulcer). Anyway, fast forward about half a year later, and it seems that my IBS is getting worse and my medicine doesn't seem to be helping that much. I go to the doctor again to get a different medicine, which also doesn't seem to be doing much good. In the meantime, I've been keeping a food journal and doing more research on my own. After a couple of months of pain, I figure out the problem--I've developed fructose malabsorption. After cutting out soda and other things high in fructose, the problem is as fixed as it can be.
1	After a mishap on the bicycle immediately after getting home I thoroughly cleaned the scrape and applied Neosporin then covered the wound with a bandage.  Over the next couple days I regularly cleaned the wound and watched for any signs of infection.
-1	I had to go to the doctor with my mother when she was having a stroke and I had to explain all of her symptoms to not only the doctor, but the paramedics and nurses as well. Explaining her symptoms directly helped them get my mother care faster.
1	I had a toothache and found out it was infected. They gave me an antibiotic to take for 15 days. I felt better in two days, but continued to take the antibiotic as directed, because I know that is what you are supposed to do or else a new hardier strain could develop.
1	I had trouble breathing through my nose during exercise. It turns out, it was because I had a blockage in my nose called nasal polyps. I had heard about this from reading things online about congestion. I realized I needed to treat it with nasal spray so I went to my doctor about it.
-1	In 2004, I took a bad fall in front of the hospital I worked at which resulted in a fractured right hip.  It required surgery and 4 weeks later after a rehab stay I was home and regaining my mobility and living life at a much slower pace.  It was the first time I was incapacitated and had to rely on others for help.  I knew that I needed to follow the dr's orders and almost 9 months later I was back to work.  I did everything as ordered and because I was familiar with medical jargon I was a good patient.
1	My mother is a type 1 diabetic which she got in her 20s. So since then she is well versed in medical knowledge and keeps on it. She kept up on me as a kid and into my 20s. I think I learned a lot from that and apply what I learned from my mom to own health. I also consult with her still. 
1	I recall when my son had an accident by the door slamming to his fingers. He almost lost the tip of his fingers the doctors told me that I have the option of either amputate or go for a surgery to try to save the fingers but the chances are very slim. I asked them to give written information about the surgery and the likelihood of success. I took my time to go through the information provided and based on what they told me and my knowledge and I decided that he will go for surgery. It was one of the best decisions i have ever made, four years later my son's finger look pretty normal.

-1	exercising everyday for at least 45 minutes, h elps with your heart rate, sleeping rate, lowers cholesterol, muscle tone. stretching helps with overall well being.
1	When my father was ill with cancer, I was his advocate as well as him home care person.  I learned to give injections, check IV lines, administer medications at home with the help and guidance of hospice.  I learned all that I had to learn in order to keep him home so that he could pass at home and not in a sterile hospital environment.
-1	I was losing weight and had no appetite. I continued going to the doctor but everything seemed normal. I ended up in the hospital with PE's. A month later I found out I had thyroid cancer. The only reason it was found was because a scan was done looking for clots. My labs had always been normal. I understood the need for surgery to remove half my thyroid to prevent it from spreading and that the clots were probably caused from that.
1	I really just use what I have been through plus what information I get while online. I like to read about things so it makes me curious to know things.
1	I'm a Registered Nurse and took care of my husband when he was sick and dying.  At that time, the doctors communicated with me as a professional most of the time and respected my knowledge of medical issues.  We worked as collaborators.  
1	when my husband fell and broke his nose, he also got a concussion.  He kept asking me the same questions over and over, which indicated short term memory loss. He also lost a lot of blood.  The paramedics came  and took him in the ambulance.  I called them because I thought there might be a head or neck injury, and I didnt want to move him and make it worse,
-1	Mostly just general information that a lot of people know. And I've also taken some classes in college that detail health things
1	When I was pregnant my Doctor always was so surprised that I knew as much as I did. He would always go try to explain things to me and I would always start before him and tell him what he was already going to tell me. And even now with my birth control I told him things before he could even tell me.
1	I had an anxiety attack and anxiety issues that caused me to over think some things. I meditated and calmed myself down to help clear my mind and decided that what I was worried about is nothing. 
1	Not very long ago I was diagnosed with bronchitis; The results showed that the cause was a bacteria so I was prescribed a strong antibiotic to be taken for 3 days only, which I took it and it the end the bronchitis was gone. 
-1	I've been an advocate for those diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Neurologists all over the country give their newly diagnosed patients my phone number and email because they find that I'm better at explaining things than they are sometimes because I've lived with MS for 40 years. This doesn't say that I can do percentages anymore, but I have been a great  layperson neurological and psychological source to countless people I've been told for more years than I can count:-)
1	a coworker was eating some food and their throat started to close up. They were saying that they thought they were having an allergic reaction. I happened to have some benadryl, so I gave it to them. This helped reduce the swelling of their throat while we waited for an EMT to arrive.
-1	I had a pap done when I was 14 they told me my cells were abnormal that I have verbal cancer. They later tested me and said that I have HPV which could turn into cervical cancer years down the road
1	I was one of the first to see the signs that my brother has diabetes. I recall his sweet smelling breath and pointing out he was always thirsty.
1	My insurance company wanted to charge me hundreds of dollars a year to recieve a vitamin that could be purchasd over the counter for the same effect but significiantly different price. I declined and purchaed otc and the results i needed came in spite of their recommmendation. I h a d to stand up for myself and be knowledgeable in what wAs available

1	One morning I woke up and noticed that half of my face was paralyzed.  I initially thought that I must have had a stroke.  But, then I remembered seeing this happen to a friend, and it was later diagnosed as Bell's Palsy.  I went on WebMd and realized that what I was mostly likely experiencing was Bell's Palsy.  I went to the hospital to have the proper screenings to make sure it was not a stroke.  Sure enough, my prediction was correct.  I had Bell's Palsy.  I suffered facial paralysis for several weeks, but after about 3 months, I experienced a full and total recovery.  
1	A friend and I were out at a restaurant one night late after having worked together, when he started seizing. We rushed to the hospital and from there I had to describe to the doctors what had happened and help take care of his information as he was unconscious. He recovered and was diagnosed with epilepsy.  
-1	I was in a severe car accident and broke my pelvic bone. I was in the emergency room for 4 hours and I saw a lot that went on at the hospital. The doctors and nurses are trying to save lives at a timely manner to get people in and out. I was sent to a private room for 3 days then released. It was a very painful recovery but with the help of therapy I made it. I am thankful.
1	I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and needed to learn more about this disease and my options in order to make an informed decision regarding treatment, surgery, etc. I researched the best area doctors and surgeons and got a second opinion before making my decision on how to manage this diagnosis. 
1	I deal with medical issues on a daily basis at work. I am a medical coder and biller. In order to bill the insurance companies correctly, I need to code the patient's illness and care correctly. However, a strong background in the medical terminology is needed in order to make sure every supply and illness is properly coded. I often need to assist my colleagues in  this area, I am the only one in the office who is certified, so the other secretaries look to me for assistance. 
1	When my wife said her stomach was hurting she was concerned she may have been having a heart attack but knowing that at her age that it was rare and the other symptoms i felt confident telling her it was because of the leftover pizza she ate
1	One time, my brother got sick while my parents were out of town. I took care of him by doing everything my mom would do for me when I was sick. I made him stay in bed, drink lots of fluids, and take some aspirin every four hours.
1	For about six years, I was the full time caretaker for my grandmother. I had to know what medications she was allergic to, and monitor her pulse and blood pressure daily, and I had to adjust dosage of some of her medications depending on what the readings were, per her doctor's instructions.
1	I helped my best friend lose over 100 pounds by guiding him thru calorie counting and eating healthier meals. His blood pressure went down, his doctor told him his BMI is now in a healthy range and he was no longer on track to need medication for diabetes. He was constantly asking me questions about how to proceed and went 100% by the advice and guidance I gave him.
1	I was asked my medical history by a new doctor recently and gave her a care description. Of my families long history of medical issues including some she had never heard of.
-1	I have had a lot of terrible scarring issues that are too traumatic to write about. I have very bad PTSD from everything and am constantly in fear.

-1	When I was dealing with acute bronchitis, I realized there was only so much I could do aside from taking antibiotics. I realized there were certain foods that actually helped me feel better
1	I have two children.  Through experience and knowledge and I am pretty capable of knowing when to take them to the doctor versus just resting at home and when they are contagious or not.

-1	My wife went to the ER and I knew what was wrong with her. The doctor's said exactly what I had synthesized from reading online and from institution. 
-1	My son had quite a few ear infections as a baby and into toddlerhood.  When my daughter was born, I knew the signs to look for in order to take her to be seen.  Luckily, she never had an eardrum rupture (as my son did) due to my knowledge of the ear canal and what to watch for.  I felt more on top of things with my sencond child, medically speaking.
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health was when I went to the hospital for having gastroenteritis. I had a lot of questions on why this was inside of me and exactly what I got it from.
1	I have a friend that is diabetic. She has a pump that constantly pumps insulin in to her. We went on a trip to New York and we were sightseeing. Suddenly Christine did not seem right. She seemed spacey but said she felt fine. I stopped at a street vendor and got her an ice cream cone as that was all that was around. She had that and was just fine after that. I knew what to watch for with her and what to do. 
1	I demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues when i started having symptoms of a concussion. I knew what to look for and what it was. 
-1	My grandpa came home on hospice and needed his oxygen concentrator set up at his house. The hospice company delivered it but no one stuck around to hook him up to it. I was able to figure out from some past experience how to add water to the cannister and set the appropriate flow rate for him. 
1	Someone asked me about their chest hurting and their fingers getting numb and I was able to help them decide not to spend money and go to the ER for a heart attack because it was actually a panic attack. 
-1	I studied biology and medicine in college. I read through what types of medicines there are from doctor medical to therapy medical. I studied what their responses are that occurred in the body
-1	I don't have an extreme amount of health experience or knowledge of health.  I try to stay up-to-date, like most people, but all we have to keep us up-to-date are statistics and calculations put forth by professionals in the medical field.  
1	When I had my daughter she was born with a different blood type than me and had very bad jaundice due to it. I had researched jaundice prior to her birth because my oldest child had it as well, so I had knowledge.
1	I am a Type 1 Diabetic.  Several years ago, I had to go to the hospital due to catching the flu.  I ended up staying overnight because I was dehydrated.  I had to explain to the doctor how I calculate how much insulin I need to take based upon the food that I consumed. 
1	My sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage 3C. I was able to tell her about the different options for treatment. 
-1	I found out over 10 years back I had a mitral valve prolapse. I knew nothing at first but learned about this through research over time. I learned this can be a genetic defect where both heart valves do not close completely. I educated myself.
1	I guess when I get sick I am able to know the difference between viral and bacterial diseases. I am able to know that I don't always get antibiotics (they aren't always effective or useful) and that I shouldn't ask the doctor for them.
-1	I've never really had an experience that demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues, but in every case i have made an effort to treat my health situation as best as possible.
-1	I've worked as a CNA for a few years.  I also have a few minor health problems. I read on health related issues occasionally too. I like to be in the know.  I'm terrible with math so all my answers are probably wrong.  
1	When I was trying to lose weight for my wedding, I vigorously kept track of the calories I consumed by reading every label and went running everyday. I made sure that I was at a calorie deficit everyday to ensure that I was losing weight.
1	My care for my mother with Alzheimers disease. I have read several books and spoken many times with her doctor on how to properly care for her. I know how to give her the medications she needs, move her without injuring her and feed her without causing choking.
1	I had a basal cell carcinoma removed from the top of my head last year.  My father has also had these so I knew a little about what to expect from Mohs surgery.
1	I try to keep up on health related current events.  I am well versed in the flu and was actually hospitalized several years ago because I was so sick. I knew based on my symptoms and that my fever was increasing to get help.
1	I work with children and often have to deal with minor injuries and illness and decide what might need medical attention. This includes monitoring fevers and knowing when they need to see a doctor.
-1	My mother and grandmother are both cancer patients and I attended a lot of the appointments with the many doctors and took notes for them.

-1	I was able to make informed decisions in regards to receiving eating disorder treatment. I selected the right treatment sentence for me. 
1	All through high school and college, I had an interest in medical/health so I took classes as electives.  I usually received A's for the classes at a top 20 public university.
1	The only real experience would be when I was young in Boy Scouts and we learned first aid for many different injuries and illnesses. We demonstrated that knowledge every year in an annual first aid competition where we were given different scenarios and judged on how we handled the incident.
1	There's not too many to list for me. I tend to defer to someone else. However, there have been various times where I've commented (ie: on social media) with my understanding of issues that I have experience with. For example, a couple years ago I explained to a worried young male what a varicocele was.
1	These questions were not nessasaraly about knowledge of health, they are more about the knowledge of math.  I learned a lot about my health after I blew out my knee
1	I had trouble getting pregnant so I had to do IVF. I ended up doing lots of research on my own to come up with a plan with my doctor to get pregnant. I suggested some medications that were newly researched to my doctor.
1	I guess I would talk about times that I take my kids to the doctor.  I understand what their blood pressure, temp. and other vital signs should be.  This always me to ask intelligant questions or express my concerns. 
-1	I was able to research a procedure that my husband had to have. It was a scary time because he had to go under, but the knowledge gained eased the stress.
1	I was having a lot of trouble sleeping for a prolonged period of time.  The doctor believed I need to take anti anxiety medication, but I was sure that I did not.  The doctor tried prescribing me two different types of meds at two different time points, but I declined both and opted for a sleep medication instead.  I took that for a period of time and then my sleep returned to normal, which it still is. 
-1	Get a dictionary of medical terms and look up the ones you don't know in your reading material. Use the terms in sentences until they make sense. Audit some classes having to do with nursing and medicine at your local college. Go online and read medical articles that have to do with your particular medical interests.
1	After having my child, over time the symptoms of post partum depression began to appear. Having dealt with depression in the past I was able to recognize the symptoms. After a few triggering events everything came to a head. It was probably 3 weeks of struggling to even get out of bed that made me realize that I needed to seek help. I first reached out to ladies in my mom group who assured me that I was neither alone or losing my mind. From there I had the confidence to reach out to my doctor. At my appointment I described everything that was going on and we were able to get me on the appropriate medicine that I knew from past experience worked for me.
1	As I have taken some science classes in college, I felt like I had the basic gist of things when I got back my annual physical results.  I was able to see and determine which indicators were normal or abnormal.  I was able to research what I didn't know and find answers to my questions.
-1	I had a baby recently and spent some time in and around the hospital for sometime. I had some complications and had to run several test and had several month working on health issues.
1	I have had a lot of medical issues in my life which help  my knowledge. I also previously was an LPN for about nine years which help contribute to my medical knowledge that I have.
1	I went to the doctor to get bloodwork done because I was noticing some symptoms that could be caused by various medical conditions, including thyroid or dietary issues. I knew which issues to mention to the doctor to be screened.
1	During a breast exam conducted by my primary care physician, she noted a lump. She then fully explained to me the details of the lump including whether it was firm or not, its size, its direction in relation to my nipple etc. She also then discussed the plans going forward (performing an ultrasound). I was able to understand all of this information, which allowed me to agree with her decisions and choices.
1	I have knowledge of health and medical issues in the sense that I typically know when to go to the doctor. I know what symptoms are associated with what illnesses, and I know what to expect from treatment. For instance, I had the flu a few weeks ago. After most of my symptoms had passed, my lymph nodes became so swollen that they were visible from across the room. I knew I was getting a secondary infection and went to the doctor. As I had predicted, they put me on prednisone and a strong antibiotic.
1	I take my blood pressure readings on a fairly consistant basis.  I noticed that my readings were creeping upwards and I was at the same time feeling other odd syntoms, such as my arm hurting.  I called my doctor and suggested I have a stress test to see if some significant was going on.
-1	I was feeling sick i had fever and flu symptoms. However something didnt feel right. I noticed my lymp nodes on my neck were swollen. I knew this could be a serious viral infection. I went to see my doctor and in deed i had a viral infection. My doctor gave me antibiotics.

-1	Having been reading health materials and also being literate. Some health information are basic and most of it are derived from calculations so it is easy to describe the real situation
1	Going to the doctor and knowing how low my blood pressure should be and what birth control works best for me
1	I worked with children with severe and profound illnesses as a result I learned a number of basic medical techniques including tube feeding, IV maintenance, and other low level tasks that I would have to perform in an emergency.  In addition the necessity of understanding medical issues with a rare disease gets much higher since many doctors have never heard of my condition. 
-1	my life experience while i visit hospitals sometime i observe a few doctors and patients so i know what what its life to pay attention to all the issues and treat them 
1	I had a missed miscarriage and was scheduled for a D&C the following morning.  A few years later a friend was also experiencing a missed miscarriage and her doctor gave her the option to wait and miscarry naturally or have the D&C.  I was able to discuss my experience with her and what I learned after my surgery was complete.  My experience was able to help her make her own decision.  
-1	I helped my sister when she fell and sprained her ankle. Helped her elevate it and put ice  on it until she could get to a doctor
1	I did have a false positive mammogram. I did have to have  a biopsy, etc. but I stayed calm and went through the process to make sure that it was nothing.
-1	My daughter was 8 months old and became ill. We took her to the doctor several times and he kept saying she had the flu. Because of how I often read medical books, I knew something was wrong other than the flu. I was right. My daughter was eventually hospitalized and the doctors said she would have died if not for a miracle and my persistence. 
1	My husband was diagnosed with serrated polyposis and frequently has colonoscopies to manage and monitor it.  He is often still groggy from the anesthesia when his doctors come to talk to us about the findings so I've largely taken control over understanding the condition and the information the doctors tell us.
1	I previously worked in the emergency room as a behavioral health technician. It was my job to behavioral and medical concerns. Abbreviations were commonly used by physicians, so I needed to interpret certain paperwork that patients gave to me from their physicians. 
-1	When I was in the field we trained us how to respond a patient like doing CPR, inserting IV fluids to the patient and Emergency response situation.
-1	I do my own research on the internet and ask friends. A doctor once misdiagnosed my appendicitis. I   have an appendix that points backward instead of forward in my body, so the symptoms present were in a different location. I researched and found this information.
1	Last month, I what seemed like pretty standard pharyngitis for a few days. However, one day it progressed into ear symptoms and tremendous pressure and I knew that I had a middle ear infection. I called the physician (spending several hundred dollars to confirm what I already knew), got antibiotics, and since I was proactive and caught it quickly rather than waiting, there wasn't any hearing damage or other lasting effects.  
1	My most knowledgeable experience was when I had a cardiac ablation for AFib. I had done quite a bit of research on my own and my cardiologist explained everything so thoroughly that I felt I knew what was going to happen each step of the way leading to the procedure and then through recovery.
1	I had to go to the doctor once because I was having headaches and I was getting out of breath going up stairs and when I was working and I told the doctor I thought my blood pressure was too high and it was. 
1	I mean, I take very good care of myself, and I often give people nutrition and health advice. I dealt with mental illness (depression and anxiety) for years until I finally decided I needed to tackle it from all sides and finally get rid of it. This involved a great deal of research and realizing just how important physical self-care was for mental health. This was something I had neglected for years, especially in terms of sleep and nutrition. So I finally started getting enough sleep on a regular basis, eating healthy, and taking carefully selected supplements that are helpful for mental and general health, and overcame mental illness for good.
1	I decided to visit my doctor because I had a strange birthmark on my foot that I was worried about. My doctor examined the birthmark and told me that I shouldn't worry about it. However, I felt good about my diligence. 
1	I was walking up a steep hill and slipped.  I fell and skid on my knees for several feet down the hill.  My knees were cut up badly and there was dirt and rocks in my knees.  Based on my previous medical knowledge I just went home, cleaned the area out with soap and water.  Scrubbed the area down really well, applied antibiotic ointment and gauze covering and it healed on it's own.
1	I have had some first aid training in my life.  I have also had the experience of take care of my family and myself when someone was sick.  
-1	"When I was younger, I was diagnosed with Epstein Barr Virus and I understood what the doctor told me. He explained to me that it was incurable and that the teiters (I probably misspelled that) would never change, but God healed me and the test results did change. My doctor was in shock and He said, ""I believe what you believe""."
-1	My neighbor got stung by a wasp last year.  He was stung on the neck.  The sting was very red and swelling fast.  I took him to the emergency room.  He found out he was allergic and it waas a good thing I took him on to the emergency room.
1	I went for a physical exam and was told I had high blood pressure.  I already was familiar with the condition because there are people in my family who have the same condition.  I was aware of the type of medication that could be prescribed to me.
-1	When I went to the doctor and they explained to me the chances of heart disease, I new the numbers and understood the percentages right away.
-1	I diagnosed myself as having hypothyroidism because the symptoms that I was experiencing I researched and found that I had the condition. I set an appointment with my doctor and told her and she told me she had to do test to confirm what the ailment was and sure enough it was nypothyroidism
1	I had a Vitamin D defiency and when my brother mentioned he was tired more and sleeping more too I told him he should take some Vitamin D to help with that because that was how I felt too when I was defient.

-1	I went to Nursing school earlier on in life and was exposed to alot of medical terminology.  In day to day life I am able to comprehend.
1	Once I was shadowing a physician prior to begging medical school. The physician asked me (in front of the patient), if the patient started off with a throat infection, and eventually developed an ear infection, how did this come about? I responded with, either the eustachian tube, or a superimposed infection brought on by the weak immune system. He told me great job and correct. Patient looked at me with pride. 
1	When my mother was battling cancer, she had a black out spell. My daughter living in California called me to come home (I was in Utah at the time). I got their as quick as I could, about a day later, and went straight to my mom in the hospital. I talked over her condition with her doctor and he was confident due to my responses that I understood what she needed and I could take her home.
1	One experience in my life that has demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues is when my grandfather started to suffer from a heart attack. I saw the symptoms. 
1	After years of going to the allopathic doctor and getting lots of tests done and very little answers, I stopped listening to mainstream medicine and started learning about naturopathic medicine.  I felt awful and had difficultly thinking clearly often. I started taking vitamin B-12 tincture, nascent iodine, and did a parisite cleanse (which includes micro-organisms, not just the FDA's definition of a parisite), and for the first time in my life I can think clearly by default and stopped taking prescription medication for ADD.
-1	I think I do well at assessing my own health issues. If I am dizzy or light headed I will try to eat sugary foods. If my symptoms are any worse I will diagnose them the best I can then see a doctor if needed. 
1	My niece had made coffee using a coffee maker but forgot to place the sieve (sheet). Therefore, the coffee was highly concentrated when we drunk it. After about an hour, I felt very nervous and jittery (I was watching a football game) which I attributed to my favorite team losing, but took some time to lie down regardless. I was able to assess my true symptoms and quickly realized that this was no normal reaction â I had overdosed from caffeine. We went to the emergency room and the doctor said my quick reaction saved my life â and my niece's.
-1	I dont have alot of knowledge when it comes to health or medical issues. So im not sure what i would even write in this form here.

1	As a hypochondriac I do a lot of research on different health issues, so when my friend was experiencing digestive issues, I questioned him regarding his symptoms and then accurately guessed his condition, which was later verified by his doctor.
1	My mother is diabetic and has several other health issues and a history of cancer and more recently heart disease. Because I have spent so much time at hospitals with her, I am accustomed to the signs and affects of certain different health issues. I can usually help her before she even asks just by observing how she is feeilng
1	Over the course of several days, I've noticed my roommate has stayed in the bathroom for long periods throwing up. His diet isn't the best, as he consumes a lot of sugary foods/drinks such as soda and candy as well as eating a lot of fast food. I told him his symptoms reminded me of someone who has acid reflux and searched online to confirm these symptoms. When he got officially diagnosed by a doctor, it was confirmed. 
-1	I was told a few years ago that I needed to have major surgery, and what the recovery process would be like afterwards. So, I remember that I researched as much as I could and I thought ahead of any questions that I could ask when I sat down for my consultation with the surgeon.
1	I have suffered from depression and I started to realize it when my mood started changing and went from bad to worse. I was emotionally distraught and physically fatigued. From what I knew I was suffering from depressions and anxiety and went to my doctor. He prescribed medicines to address both issues and within a few weeks I started to feel better
1	A doctor told me to get the flu vaccine during pregnancy. My friend is against vaccinations, especially during pregnancy, and told me not to get it. I did some research on the topic and found out for myself that I should get the vaccine because the risks to my baby seemed to be lower if I did.
1	I had some odd symptoms last year that were not going away on their own, and was trying to find out information online.  I eventually self diagnosed myself with shingles, as what I had looked like the images I found online.  I went to the doctor for confirmation and a prescription, and he said it was indeed shingles, and prescribed me antibiotics which cleared it up pretty quickly.
-1	guess i'm not doing so well at the math so maybe i do have difficulties understanding health info. but that's not old age, i've always been like that
1	"Last time I went to the doctor I was given a new prescription and when I was asked if I had any questions or wanted more information on the prescription I reiterated to the doctor everything I had learned from the information included to make sure I understood everyting correctly, and all the doctor need to say was ""Great, there's nothing more I need to teach you!"" as I did indeed read correctly everything that was given to me."
-1	Had an ache in my side for several days before I made it to the doctor. In the meantime, I took care of it as a kidney infection (correctly) because I knew that was where my kidney was and saw my symptoms.
1	My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.  I also knew that these tests could produce higher than normal levels if the patient has an enlarged prostate.  I asked to see his former results.  They were up and down a lot, which is typically a sign that there is NOT prostate cancer, but instead, an enlarged prostate.  I also knew that an enlarged prostate could be due to prostatitis, an infection of the prostate.  Sure enough, he went back to the doctor to follow up, and turned out to have a prostate infection.
1	I was able to recognize the early stages of ADHD in my eldest child due to caring for my cousin for many years when he was younger (he had the same condition). Since I knew so much about the condition already, I was able to sidestep a lot of the pitfalls that many parents of ADHD children have to deal with, since I knew what to expect and why.
1	I know that antibiotic is only effective against bacteria infection and should be use for viral or fungus infection. When a doctor prescribe antibiotic I should continue to take the medicine until it runs out even if I feel better only after taken it for a few days. 
1	My husband's cholesterol is high.  We talked to the doctor and then looked up information to see what target number we needed to get him to.  Then we researched on our own and followed information the doctor gave us to determine the changes we could make in our diet and exercise program to help bring his cholesterol down.  We were able to facilitate that change enough in 6 months to avoid needing to have him take medication.
1	I was a medical coder and biller for 6 months. I had to read the doctor's dictations and assign each surgery or visit a code to be paid by the insurance companies.
1	 About ten years ago I was out at a bar with a friend of mine. We had a few drinks and then caught the bus back to my house. We were sitting in the living room trying to decide what to order for dinner  when he started to complain about feeling dizzy. He excused himself and went to the bathroom. A few minutes later I heard a loud thud and went to go check on him. The door was open and he was having a seizure on the floor. I pulled him by the shoulders out of the small bathroom and into the larger adjacent room. I elevated his head on my knees and stuck my leather wallet between his teeth. After about ten seconds or so he calmed down. He was kind of out of it so I called an ambulance for him. He was ok in the end but is now on medication.
1	I worked as a medical receptionist at an ear, nose, throat clinic for 2 years. There I learned a lot of medical lingo and how things are run behind the scenes at a clinic.
1	Years ago I had been having back pain. It had lasted for about a week, and initially thought that I had just pulled a muscle. I woke up one night with more than a mild pain and a fever. I knew that I likely had a kidney infection because of these symptoms.

1	When I was taking care of my grandfather when he was undergoing dialysis, I had to read plenty of forms and research the procedures, remedies, and prognoses online.
-1	I was told that I had pneumonia but they could not determine whether or not it was viral or bacterial and rushed to prescribe me antibiotics and an inhaler. I looked up all of the options and decided that it was prudent for me to take this medication.
-1	i am not a doctor or nurse so i do not have a lot experience in being right over their knowedge at all. i have no experience where i would consider myself more knowledgeable than them,. that would be arrogant and i would not understand someone doing that.
1	My son has asthma. I am aware of when an asthma attack is coming on and treat it as fast as possible. My son tend to wait until his asthma is getting out of control before informing me about it. i have had to learn to be watchful and to also teach him warning sign so that we can keep it under control with out frequent visits to the ER.
1	When I went to the doctors for a checkup we talked about getting a flu shot. I explained how I heard the flu shot wasn't effective at the time and I'd be better taking my chances and not getting it. The doctor agreed and I didn't get sick that winter.
1	I recently was told I have  a health issue that can be corrected with medication.  I don't like the side effects, but I know the issue could cause more problems than the medication. 
-1	I have a health condition. When  I went to the er I was very knowledgable of what the doctor was asking in regards to my condition. 
1	I was having trouble going to sleep at night which is very unlike me. Usually I fall asleep within five minutes. I reviewed what I had been doing and eating and realized that I had started drinking more caffeine than usual later in the evening. I stopped drinking any caffeinated beverages after 5 pm and my insomnia disappeared.
1	One example that comes immediately to mind is tracking maximum heart rate of VO2 max as it applies to active fitness.  I volunteered for a study several years ago where we measured both of these metrics over the course of several months while on a fitness regimen.  This process allowed me to learn more about how my age affects my workouts and the target heart rate I should aim for.  I also learned about oxygen levels and how that plays a large role in your fitness, specifically with cardio exercises.
1	I was able to use the internet to correctly recognize that my mother was exhibiting symptoms of Ludwig's Angina, resulting in a life-saving trip to the ER.
1	A friend of mine recently was having severe pain on her upper right side and wanted to wait it out. I'd previously had my gallbladder removed and knew that this was a symptom. I convinced her to go to the emergency room to be checked out just in case and I ended up being correct.
1	My husband had high cholesterol, high triglycerides high blood pressure and hypothyroid. I have done a ton of research and even called experts in the fields and asked for advice. My husband would not take statins drugs. He will only take his synthroid for the hypothyroid. With diet, supplements, exercise and good advice from experts he no longer has high blood pressure or high triglycerides. I have his cholesterol in a good range which is just a hair below treatment and he feels very good. I myself only take supplements and all my tests come back normal because I believe in taking care of my health. I have the osteoporosis only and I have that under control.
-1	I take care of dependent adults with disabilities and assist them with their medications and appointments this has helped me gain a little knowledge
1	When a family member was having symptoms of a heart attack I knew they should go to the emergency room based on those symptoms. I have other family members who have heart problems, and I worry myself, so I have read a lot of information, and gained a lot of knowledge about heart disease from my doctor.
1	I saw a podiatrist recently for fungal infection even though I knew that I could not treat it internally while still breastfeeding my six-month old daughter. I accepted the referral and went to the appointment to see what, if any, my other options were, and what the time table would be like to pursue internal treatment.
1	There was a time I went to the doctor with a certain set of symptoms and told the doctor I would like a prescription for amoxicillin and he agreed that would be appropriate for the symptoms and wrote one up.
1	My husband was showing the symptoms of Lyme disease, and I knew it was likely that he could have been bitten by a tick recently, so I made him go to the doctor and it turned out that he did have Lyme disease.

1	I had to live through my mothers cancer surgery, chemo, recovery. I was the one talking to all the doctors, and my mother was able to follow all of the instructions.
1	I really can't think of a particularly good example.  I guess recently I've been watching what I eat and working out more, and as a result I've lost fat and gained muscle mass.
1	I broke my foot a couple weeks ago. Going in I was very clear about my questions, asked about the options, and volunteered what I knew the treatment would likely be if the x-rays came back in the affirmative. 
1	I monitor my cholesterol and calorie intake carefully.  I also exercise 5 days a week via walking or lifting light weights.  I do to my doctor, dentist and eye doctor regularly.
1	There is no one experience. Experience is built up over a life time. Obviously without medical schooling a person is limited on how much knowledge they could have. I would say I had a complex medical issue years ago that I used the Internet and doctors to attempt to resolve. 
1	My friend developed symptoms of losing weight, feeling tired, coughing, and sinus problems. I have known people with these symptoms who had lung cancer. I urged my friend to see a doctor, and he found that he did have cancer.
1	Both of my sisters died from ovarian cancer in their early forties.  My paternal grandmother also died from the same disease and it was determined that a genetic mutation was the cause.  I knew that if I was tested for the mutation, I would be able to make a more informed decision to remove my ovaries or not.  I was tested and opted not to remove my ovaries because I didn't have the mutation which lowered my risk for the disease.
1	My husband wanted me to take our youngest son to the ER. I told him that there wasn't anything they could do, I'll be told to push fluids and have him rest because it's just viral and had to run its course. Went to the ER in the middle of night and that's exactly what I was told to do, $200 later. 
-1	A friend of mine messaged me with a complaint about a pain in her side, after she described the pain, I told her to that it was appendicitis and to get to hospital. She went to the hospital and had emergency surgery to remove her appendix that same day,
-1	When I was pregnant they were testing me for Preeclampsia every time I went to see the doctor. All the tests were coming back negative. When i was in my third trimester i started feeling sick, I always felt like I had high blood pressure. I felt like I was slowly developing preeclampsia. Tests for some reason were not showing anything even though i felt all the symptoms of preeclampsia. At 39 weeks tests finally showed it and i was hospitalized and induced the same day due to severe preeclampsia. 
1	When my wife was having our daughter, I researched a lot of the different drugs and prodecdures that were going. I asked the nurses and doctors about what was going on and if there would be any side effects to the drugs. For her and the baby as well. I tried to be informed as possible with everything going on.
1	When I went to the doctor this morning he went over a number of items and I had no issues understanding them.
-1	Once a year, I usually get a very bad case of the flu and I never go to the doctor to get medication or to get a check up. I avoid going to the doctor so much and despise the thought of getting told bad news about my health that I just tough it out. It can potentially last for months at a time, and even though I know in the back of my head that if I go to the doctor's office they could probably prescribe a medication that could help me much faster than whatever is over the counter, I do not go. I know I am in the wrong and it really shows a lack of understanding when it comes to medical issues. 
1	An experience in life that demonstrated my health knowledge was when i had a job in high school and a kid asked me how to not get a girl pregnant. Then the question led me to tell him that their are birth control pills that a woman can take to not get themselves pregnant.
1	I had a co-worker who got told she had diabetes. My best friend growing up had type 1 diabetes and my Nana had type 2, so I talked with her awhile about what to expect, what stable blood pressure looked like, and what types of food to eat and which to avoid.

1	After having several kidney stones I knew what my pain was and I also knew what the procedure was to remedy the problem.
-1	My husband had numbness and tingling in his right leg causing drop foot . It did not add up to me because yes he had back herneiation but not typical pain from herniation so we tried many different doctors of all kinds and behold he was finally diagnosed with MS we are not completely sold on that diagnoses either so this is disconcerting as well because he isnât that mobile anymore. 
1	I sprained my ankle.  I did not go to  the doctor because I knew that I should ice it, keep it up and stay off it.   I also wrapped it.  I did not see why I should pay money for the doctor when I knew what to do.
1	I worked for a medical software company and so that gave me an extended vocabulary surrounding medical conditions. Beyond that my father is diabetic and has had a heart attack.
1	I was able to assist an elderly woman who we were friends with with her blood sugar. She was getting sick and it turns out that her blood sugar was getting too high because of her sweet potato consumption. She thought only desserts and things with added sugar would spike her blood sugar.
-1	Eleven years ago, I was having digestive issues. Because I received no answers from my physician, I took matters into my own hands. Yes, I self diagnosed. I kept a food diary and noted how different foods made me feel. I suspected I was gluten intolerant. When I removed gluten from my diet, many symptoms disappeared within one week. Later, I took a lab test and it found that I was gluten intolerant. 
1	I have very little experience and knowledge of health or medical issues.  I rarely go to the doctors, only once 1 year or if I'm really sick.
1	A girl in my dance class complained that whenever she bent forward and stayed there for more than a few seconds, the blood rushed to her head and she got black spots in her vision. I told her that it was because she has low blood pressure, as the same thing happens to myself and my father for the same reason. 
1	When my children have not been feeling well, I've been able to get them what they need to feel better. Ex. tylenol for teething, etc.  
-1	I have had unknown leg pain most of my life. I injured my back quite a few years ago, and I  have worked in a hospital a few years ago. I have take medical terminology classes. Biology classes. As well as as a few other classes to be a Naturopathic Practitioner.  I have yet to take the Anatomy classes.
-1	I went to the cardiologist when I had unusual pain in the center of my chest. I told him due to the nature of the pain and the heart disease history of my family I felt I needed an angioplasty to check for blockages. It turned out I needed a stent.
1	working in a hospital and radiology office in the past has inhanced my knowledge of medical issues.  I did ultrasounds for 7 years,  and it taght me many things about healthcare.
1	I was having a certain problem that often can be mistaken for another very common health problem.  After many doctors visits, lab tests all coming back negative. There was still no resolution to my problem. With my own research and persistence I was able to present the Doctor with a possible diagnosis and once we both agree and I was given treatment my symptoms were almost gone or at least quite managable. 
-1	 I used to work in the public school system. I worked with a teacher who was a Type One diabetic. I also had a son in law at the time who was a Type One diabetic. I had witnessed my son in law's struggles with blood sugar ups and downs,and had seen him suffering from a complication of diabetes,known as Ketoacidosis. Because of my hands on experience with my son in law,I was able to recognize the signs and symptoms in the teacher I worked with,when she fell ill one day. I was able to summon help for her and give my opinion on what was going on with her in the moment,health-wise. It turned out I was correct and that she did indeed have Ketoacidosis.
1	I was at get together at a friends house and her parents were there.  We were outside playing volleyball and her father started feeling dizzy and out of breath and his heat was pounding.  I thought he might be having a heat stroke, so I made sure we put cool, wet towels on his head and around the back of his neck.  It turned out that it was a heat stroke and they told me that this probably helped to not cause him more harm from this.
-1	When I sprained my knee in a third world country. I had to rely on my own and online research.  I did not have the chance to go to the doctor because of the country.
-1	I suppose this would have been associated with my father's cancer, where I had to essentially inform myself about the things he should/shouldn't eat during that point in time, especially since he didn't clearly discuss these issues since I was a teenager (he didn't want me worrying).
1	My boyfriend was complaining of swelling in his groin area, which was a concern due to the location.  I knew that lymph nodes were located in that area (along with several other areas of the body) and that it might just be that his body is fighting off a sickness.  Over the next few days he came down with a viral infection.
1	An instance in my life that demonstrated medical issues is when i was pregnant and put on bedrest  I was very aware of how to act, what to do and not to do.  I was able to carry to full term when only given a 30% chance of it
1	My mom took multiple pills and was just out on a new one, one night she started talking crazy and incoherrant along with inability to move. Remembering she just started a new pill knew she was probably having side effects from the drugs.
-1	I had been told by my primary care physician that I was anemic due to menustration. I knew from college that I was supposed to ask why I was anemic and I knew my pcp had just pulled it out of his ass that it was due to my menustration. I went to a new GYN and he realized that I was insulin resistant while the other doctor missed it.
1	After the birth of my son, I noticed that his skin was unusually dry and would not retain moisture from any of the varieties of lotion that I purchased. After taking him to a Dermatologist, he was diagnosed with Eczema. I manage his condition my moisturizing him with Bag Balm, which is very efficient in managing his skin moisture and I make sure to use sunscreen on him.
1	I have had discussions with people in the health profession but I am not sure what you are asking in this question.
1	I feel like going through the process of having a baby has helped educate me in terms of health and medical issues. I read up on various medical issues that could happen during pregnancy and delivery. 
-1	I have often had to look up medical questions. I really feel like I know nothing about medicine. I just learn from looking it up
1	When I was 19 years old, I worked as Direct Care staff for an individual with autism. Along with autism he had other health issues and. Part of my job was to be knowledgeable about those issues and how to handle them if any problem arised
-1	I learned a lot about health issues when my appendix burst. I had to do research on what to eat and what medications to take
1	In 2013, I went deaf in one ear after blowing my nose. I waited a week to see if it would get better. It didn't. I realized the cause was actually an infection I had had a decade earlier that never completely went away. A small participle of infection had remained in my sinuses for a decade, then moved when I blew my nose. If I hadn't figured that out, and relied upon a doctor to figure it, I might have have had the infection inside my ear pop my ear drum or worse.
1	In 1995, I came down with an extreme flu-like illness that I almost died from. Several years later, after researching the information online and talking with my doctor, i came to the conclusion that i had Hanta-virus due to living in close quarters with a field mouse that infected me.

1	There was a time where I had a rash and  I didn't know what it was because allergy medicines weren't working. I looked up multiple rashes online and found out about eczema, so I got some treatment for it and it helped take the rash away.
1	I knew I had GERD after realizing that some over-the counter medications were no longer effective in treating my symptoms.  had also noticed that something as simple as drinking a glass of water too fast would trigger heart burn and a great deal of discomfort. 
1	I lift weights 3 days per week and do 4+ total hours of cardio per week, in addition to walking at least 7 hours per week (I have a desk job, so even though I'd like more than that, I am content with 7). I do this because I understand muscle mass is important, and can be harder to put on as one ages. Also, strength training can help with bone density, which is useful especially as women age. I also want good cardiovascular health. This is all because people in my family tend to live to be quite old (my great-grandmother is 96!), but not necessarily with a great quality of life, and I want to have a great quality of life as I age.
1	I was at the doctor's office and they were explaining to me what it meant to have high blood pressure, the potential complications that it can cause, and what I need to change in my life in order to get my blood pressure under control. I understand all of the information they gave to me, I implemented it and I had a normal blood pressure reading 6 months later at my next visit.

-1	When I was at the doctors he was explaining my condition in vast detail and I understood every part and asked a technical question about it and he was able to fill me in on the more hard parts. Like the likelyhood of certain medications to cause elevated blood calcium.
-1	A time in my life that demonstrated I had knowledge of health issues was when I started taking care of my 81 year old grandmother. She was very sick with multiple illnesses and I had to learn about them all and learn about her medications and the things I needed to do to be able to take care of her properly.
-1	My experience in life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was the last year when I had to help a old lady in the street.
-1	I've helped others with mental illness. I've had pretty unique experiences with mental health that has led me to advising others. Answering questions for people.

I had spent much time in headache clinics as well as a month inpatient in a special migraine unit in Michigan where they tried to solve my migraines.
1	I recently was bitten by a dog. I knew to try to get a little blood out of the wound and then rinse it with water and soap before wrapping. I was reluctant to go to the ER due to costs, so I waited until the following day to go to my primary care physician.
1	I was a psychologist / counselor working in a family medicine clinic.  Many times I helped people understand what their physicians were suggesting.  Most common questions related to probabilities of different outcomes with different types of treatment.

I also knew that my life had probably been save because I could have had a heart attack or stroke. 
-1	I had a torn ACL last summer. This was a result of a prior ACL injury that I had in the past. When I got hurt last summer I knew it is going to be my ligament and that I am going to need to have a surgery most likely. I felt the damage in my knee and I know it is going to be very serious.

1	At 5 am I heard the dog barking from my Mom's bedroom. When I got there I saw that she looked ok but things were out of place (dog on floor instead of bed, she was on the opposite side of bed from where she usually was). I talked to her for a minute and she wasn't normal. I thought she had a stroke and called 911. It turned out to be a seizure.

1	When my mother was diagnosed with diabetes I was able to help her get to classes and learn how to make better choices to control it. I may not have had the information directly but I knew where to get it and what questions to ask. We found the best treatments that were suited to her needs and she is now living in a much better condition than before her diagnosis.

-1	"I spent a good deal of my childhood being treated for various mood disorders. having these different diagnosis given to me gave me some degree of understanding about how to approach medical information when it is given to me in a medical environment. Otherwise, i have always taken an interest in nutrition and have always read nutrition labels which has helped me understand what is conventionally understood to be ""healthy"" or ""unhealthy"" foods"
1	I sometimes track my calories on what I eat if I'm trying to lose weight. I have to read the labels and serving size of foods to make sure I don't eat too many calories. For medical issues, I have to measure out medication into a syringe and had to learn to inject myself intramusculary.

-1	Very recently I felt strong heartburn in my esophagus, typically a doctor would recommend some anti-acids, but, given that I've taken some courses in college and know certain things about the human body, anti-acids were to make my condition worse because 90% of heartburn is caused by too little acid. Based on that knowledge I managed to end my heartburn situation by simply decreasing the ph of my stomach. 
1	"My son has had several hospital stays in his life and I am usually able to communicate to the doctors and nurses using medical terms, many of them are surprised and glad to have to not ""dumb down"" the way they explain his health issues."
1	My children have been ill on numerous occassions with upset stomachs.  I know from past experience that they need to stay hydrated and also eat foods that are easy on the stomach.  Being able to know to give them a BRAT diet has saved trips to the doctor.

1	My husband got a scrape or bite on his elbow. Within a few hours, his elbow swelled up to the size of a tennis ball. This was Not Normal, so we took him to the ER.

1	When my grandpa was in the ER for his gout and fever, the doctor prescribed him a new medication to treat his gout. When we were given the discharge papers, I reviewed everything and reviewed the medications side effects. It had stated that the medication should not be used if another medication is currently being taken. I asked a nurse about that and she wasn't sure about it so she talked to the doctor. The doctor had to review all the medications again and ended up saying it was okay to take both medications at the same time after a thorough review.

1	When my ex attempted suicide due to a benzodiazpene overdose, I took appropriate measures such as making sure she stayed awake after I found her to reduce risk of brain damage. A negative result of knowing about that class of drug is knowing that memory damage is likely due to damagine GABA receptors, which have a critical role.
1	I was feeling somewhat unbalanced and weak on my left side. I knew it wasn't a stroke because I was not paralyzed, exhibited no symptoms, nor did I have any risk factors. One doctor thought it might have been a stroke. I went to a chiropractor, and after several adjustments, I felt more balanced and stronger on my left side.
1	I have PCOS.  I have done research on it and been to various doctors.  At one point, my doctor put me on the drug metformin.  He did initial blood work but did not follow up.  After doing more research, I learned that he needed to do follow up blood work to check my levels.  He was not doing follow up blood work.  I took myself off of the drug and never went back. PCOS involves a lot of trial and error. I feel like the patient needs to be their own advocate. 
-1	I went to school to be a medical assistant. My first job out of school was at a dermatology office where I served as a medical assistant for a year. I learned all kinds of things about the skin and just the medical field in general. After Dermatology I had experience in OBGYN offices and Primary care. All physicians and offices are very diverse.

1	I can absorb knowledge and information better than most. I have no problems figuring out what I should do when a problem or condition. Usually I have been told before, and I remember it.

1	About 20 years ago my daughter called me one morning as my 10 year od grandson was getting on the bus and she happened to mentioned he had been getting up in the night to go to the bathroom. In the next sentence she said and he is so thirsty the last coupe days all he wants to do is drink water. He had already taken the bus so I told her it was urgent for them to get him when he got to school and take him right to his Dr. I said sounds like diabetes. They took him in and his numbers were so high they admitted him to the hospital for a few days. He is a type 1 diabetic.
-1	well i know that some of thesee i did not know but with myself i know because my dr tells me and i can read my paper 
1	My friend had a gallbladder attack and her doctor told her that she could avoid surgery if she ate healthy. She started talking about the things that she ats and I noticed that her diet was not the kind of diet she should have if she is trying to avoid gallbladder attacks. She still ate things like fried chicken or pizza which are foods rich in fat, fat triggers gallbladder attacks and I told her that this kind of food would most certainly lead to a gallbladder attack if she does not cut back or completely eliminate them from her diet. 
-1	I donât have any health issues so I donât know how to answer this question... so donât know how to explain 
1	I sometimes deal with IBS and have researched a bunch of information on it for possible remedies. When my sister started dealing with some stomach issues I was able to help her with some diet tips to get it back under control. She was on a fairly unhealthy diet due to being in college and limited food options, so we figured out a plan that would work for her.
1	I had a length of time in my life where I did not have any health insurance. During this time, I could not go to the doctor's office no matter how ill I became, because I could not afford to pay for treatment. I had to rely on my own knowledge of symptoms and treatments and I became very good at finding reliable sources on Google for anything I might not know, like how to make home treatments. 
1	I had to help my mom with her insulin.  She needed 1 unit for every 20 points her blood sugar was over the reccommended level and i was responsible for figuring out exactly how much insulin to give.

1	I used to be a lifeguard and was responsible for first aid and basic care in the event of any of the swimmers getting injured. This showed that I knew basic medical information.
-1	I am not sure I have had an experience that gave me any knowledge of health or medical issues.  Except I have a friend with diabetes and have known folks with cancer and have died.
1	A woman I know was having chest pains, she wanted to call an ambulance or drive herself to an emergency room, but I told her that the cost of the ambulance ride might not be covered by her insurance, and her insurance might not cover the cost of her emergency room visit if it turned out that she did not actually need emergency care. After some discussion she decided to take a Lyft to an urgent care facility. I haven't been able to find out what happened to her after that. 
1	While my sister was in the hospital for child birth, I actively monitored her stats. I alerted the nurses when her bp was fluctuating for no reason.

My mom kept asking what was wrong and how i was feeling and i told her that i thought it was my stomach itself or something that had to do with it because i wasn't able to poop. Turns out i needed my gallbladder removed because of the severity of the gallstone.

1	I majored in psychology and took many science classes. When I hear about anti-depressant medications, I know the differences between SSRIs and other types and generally understand the mechanism by which they work on the brain. 
1	An experience in your life that demonstrated your knowledge of health or medical issues was when I received my doctorate degree
1	I have a chronic illness and have had multiple complications from that. I have a positive ANA, I've had a stroke yet I've had no heart or vascular disease, I have chronic fatigue, I've had extremely elevated liver enzymes where they go up and down. The one thing they do know I have is Hashimoto's auto immune thyroid and even though it hasn't been confirmed yet, I believe my stroke was caused by my Hashi's because it causes me to have afib sometimes. I know that if I have one Auto immune disease I could have others. I know that if my thyroid hormones are not at the right level they can cause all kinds of problems with metabolic processing that could include problems with my liver or my immune system may decide to attack my liver. I have figured out on my own that my body does not convert T4 to T3 and being on a medication that has both is optimal for me. And I've learned that sometimes blood work does not tell the whole story, that more than anything you have to listen to your symptoms and use those as a guide along with blood work.
-1	Not that there was a lot but the times I did have to have hospital visits for myself and my family members. A few times it was very serious but mostly routine checkups.  And general knowledge I have learned over time.

1	I experienced three severe gum infections in a rather short period of time. The first two time I was treated with antibiotic. My PCP was very hesitant to prescribe each time, but especially so the third time. I understood this hesitancy because I was knowledgeable about the increasing difficulty to treat with antibiotics, because of such widespread prevalence of our overexposure to antibiotics, including transmission from animals through foods we eat.
1	When I started to get light headed after awhile was a warning sign that I should go to the doctors since this has never happen to me before. So I went to the doctors and explained what has been happening lately. He then tells me that if anything changed in my daily life. I said I started to work 2 jobs. He said it could be that you overworked yourself but he will still run some test. He told me to take it easy and rest. After a couple of days of rest I was fine.
1	I was having a lot of issues with constant low grade headaches for several months. I saw several doctors and did a plethora of online research to try to find out what was going on.

1	My neighbor came over to visit and as she was leaving she lost her balance a little, I noticed that her speech was starting to slur and face seemed a little slack on one side. It was apparent to me that she may be having a stroke, I called an ambulance and they were able to get her to a doctor quickly to minimize the effects.
1	I've had asthma and allergies my entire life and can explain what is happening with my symptoms accurately to doctors in order for them to best diagnose and solve the issue. I also know which of the over the counter medicines tend to solve which issues quickest and most effectively.
1	An experience in my life where I demonstrated my knowledge of health or  medical issues is when I had jaw surgery. I have been going to the orthodontist since I was two years old. I knew a lot about my mouth and what was going on. Whenever I went to have the actual surgery, I went to a different hospital with different doctors. They were explaining to me everything that was going to happen but since I have been going to the orthodontist for years I already knew everything that was going to happen and could talk to the surgeons like I knew what I was talking about.
1	I have no single experience. I just understand what my doctor is telling me because I understand the human body to some degree because of courses I've taken in school and my own reading.
-1	I was on vacation one time and my wife had a urinary tract infection. Over a couple experiences I had I had learned that if you mix baking soda with ice water and drink it really fast cure hurt urinary tract infection if it's in the early stages.  Well we were on a boat in the middle of the ocean and long story short there wasn't any doctors around unless there was a really expensive one and the lower level of the ship.  After being unexpected vacation we are not about to pay so we figure we would give this trick a try.  Surprisingly it was very hard to let the chef get us some baking soda. He wanted to know what we are doing with it why we wanted it it was actually quite daunting.  Once we finally got it she continued that for a couple days and it was cleared up completely.
-1	I can recall a time a couple of years ago where i started getting this really sore thorat.  It started slow as first and within a couple of days it would not let up.  Ive had strep before and figured that is what it was turning into. i got a flashlight and looked in the back of my throat and sure enough there were little white puss pockets started to form in my throat.  At that point i went straight to the doctor where they ran a strep test and it came back positive for strep.  I was giving antibiotics and it cleared withing a few days, but i finished all of the medicine even though i felt better as it took what was prescribed to me until it was finished. 
1	As I have PCOD problem i am aware of the symptoms and cares to be taken of the health to reduce the problem and in my home my dad have this acromigaly problem by which i am aware of the symptopms of that problem and there is no treatment for this problem and similarly i have knowledge on BP and blood sugar

I took lots of notes and asked lots of questions. The information was very technical but the doctor was able to bring it down to our level of understanding. 
-1	none because I have not needed to go to the doctor for any serious issue so I am still healthy and do not need to see to my health for now.       
1	I had to get my gallbladder taken out. Before the doctors realized it, I had mentioned I thought it was gallbladder, and the instacare doctor dismissed it and said I wouldn't be having pain in the middle of my upper stomach area, but I had researched and talked to others that this is true, that you can feel the pain in the middle. Needless to say, another attack landed me in the ER and they did an ultrasound and diagnosed me with gall-sludge. They scheduled to take my gallbladder out and did. Pain went away.
1	An experience that I can think of which demonstrated my knowledge of medical issues was my ability to successfully act on my symptoms when I had appendicitis. I didn't know what was wrong with me at first, but based on symptoms I'd heard of, plus knowing that I'm supposed to go to the hospital if I'm vomiting so much I can't keep liquids down, I suspected that I had appendicitis.

1	Someone was saying they were guaranteed not to get the flu since they'd had the flu vaccine.

1	I don't know that such an experience exists as I have very little knowledge of health or medical issues, I only know when I feel something is wrong with my body. An example would be that once I had sudden onset shortness of breath and I knew that was abnormal so instead of waiting to go the doctor, I went immediately and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism. 
-1	I was at home, alone, eating soup when I tried to swallow a lentil, but it got caught in my throat. I realized that I was not able to get it to go down and I could  feel it in my throat.

Then my mother went to her cardiologist and after an echocardiogram, he told my mother to take the water pill every other day.  Even though her doctors are in the same group, the cardiologist had not looked at her recent lab reports and her primary care physician's recommendations.  I called her PCP's office and spoke to her nurse and explained the situation.  I requested her PCP call the cardiologist and consult about her lab reports.  She did call him and together they came up with a solution to the problem.

I passed all four classes with A's and 1 B, I also took microbiology with the lab which I also passed with A's. My older brother sometimes says silly things like vaccines are not a good thing, and I have to explain to him that vaccines are actually lifesavers. Vaccines predispose us to a pathogen in a very reduced amount that It will not harm us, but It will trigger an immune response in which our immune system will have created memory t cells. So in the future if we come into contact of the pathogen It can be dealt with because of our immune systems memory cells. We have thus created a way to expose ourselves to a pathogen of a very reduced strength in order to prepare us for the same pathogen when it attacks us with full strength.

Reducing my blood glucose also corrected other stated problems.
1	Lots of medical appointments and lots of ads on tv and interest in the medical field. Good and bad doctors and doing my own research helps. 
1	Well my knowledge is pretty basic. When I went in to premature labor with my son, I thought that something like that could be avoided easily. It wasn't and my son came 3 months early. So I guess that demonstrates that my knowledge isn't that great.
-1	After I applied for my current job, I had an interview with my current boss. She told me there were three candidates that she was considering but she chose me because of medical background.

She was prescribed a preventive diabetes medication and instructed by her doctor to decrease certain foods from her diet such as, carbohydrates and foods containing sugar, as following these directions should improve her condition.

1	i have had lower back problems for a number of years. my roommate recently hurt his back. he told me the stretches and exercises he was doing were not helping - i recommended some of what i do to maintain my back, and within a few days he was already beginning to feel better. 
1	Whenever one of my family got sick, I usually know how to act in this situation for the best recovery and low cost.

-1	Before I was diagnosed with Achalasia the doctors kept insisting it was all in my head and that I was just suffering from Bulimia because I was overweight. After much research into Bulimia I realized there was no chance that was my problem because I was not able to binge eat, I couldn't eat more than 5 bites of something before regurgitating food on some days as the disease progressed. I did the research and approached doctors about the possibility of something else being wrong with me and they all ignored me. After seeing several specialists one finally listened to me and agreed the previous diagnoses were completely inaccurate. 
-1	I am very into the natural way of living. I see a guy who is into Ayurvedic healing and he has helped grow my knowledge as to what exactly happens in your body. Most issues start in the gut. So I guess I demonstrate my knowledge when I am dealing with my own health concerns.

1	When I had an infection and went to see my doctor, he told me what I had and what to take to treat it.  Once I got my prescription filled, I followed the instructions with the medication, being careful not to take it on a an empty stomach or with alcohol so that I would not suffer from adverse side effects and become ill.

1	When my child was diagnosed with certain food allergies, I made sure I am aware of the symptoms myself. I made sure I have her medication with us all the time wherever we go. Knowing what to do helps a lot in these situations.

1	I once had to call an ambulance because a friend of mine was badly injured, enough that I knew they needed immediate medical attention.

1	I was having blisters showing up on my skin one day. Even after washing they would not go away. I knew that it was probably a staph infection. I decided to go to a doctor about it and they didn't have to give an explanation because of my familiarity with the diagnosis. 
1	When my son was hospitalized, I was able to understand what the doctors were talking about as far as anatomy and body function. This helped me to get a good idea of what exactly was happening with my son and what needed to be done to help. I honestly didn't realize I knew as much as I did until I started talking with them. There were still plenty of things I didn't understand but those blanks were much easier to fil because of my basic understanding. 
1	My mother had a heart attack and while still in the hospital, she was almost given medication that would have interacted negatively with medication she was already taking.

-1	When I self-diagnosed my flu symptoms.  I started to feel bad when I thought I had a normal cold, and I was experiencing worse symptoms like dizziness and weakness.  I figured it had to be the flu based on the information I read on the internet some years earlier.
-1	I worked as a CNA for a couple years. To do that, I had to take a few medical classes. I have also taken some classes concerning health for my BA degree. Together, with being a mom, I have learned some things about health.

1	I was given a prescription and I started to have tingling in my arms. It was very strange, so I thought it might be due to the prescription.

1	My father had stents put in due to blockage in his arteries that almost caused a heart attack.  I had learned all about stents, arteries, blockage etc after this even occurred.  I had to help my dad take daily pills and check his heart rate and blood pressure to make sure everything was how the doctors wanted it. 
1	I once went to the emergency room for severe stomach pains and I was diagnosed with having gallstones. Because I have had an interest in the way the human body work, I was able to easily understand what gallstones are and how they affect my body. My diagnoses led me to further research the human body so I can fully understand how my body works and what could be the cause for any issue I might have.

1	I was sick so I looked for medicine in my house and found some by reading the label and seeing that it would make me better and feel better as well. I continued this method with buying stuff if I didn't have it or going to a doctor to tell me what to use if I needed to use something.
1	about 8 years ago i had undergo tests to see if i had contracted the HIV virus (this was after a mishap at work).  i was told the chance of my actually having the disease was something like  .01%.     knowing this didn't stop me from worrying a lot, but the statistics indicated i was virtually in the clear so i always had the statistics to fall back on when i was afraid of the results.
1	I have a child with a life long illness and am responsible for all the contact with Drs, and managing her care. I decide what medicines we are taking not what the Dr might want without doing my own research first. I do review medical journals about her condition. 
-1	An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issue was when I used the same techniques i learned after my right shoulder surgery and used it to rehabilitate my left shoulder after surgery. This way i didn't have to go to therapy and was able to treat myself. 
1	I used my experience and knowledge from prior medical discussions regarding migraine headaches to research which triggers to avoid and try to find alternative options to bring relief because the prescribed medication was not working for me. This experience has not completely alleviated the headaches, but I do feel that the frequency has been reduced.
1	Can't really say much, except for knowing to take care of myself extra well when I've come down with a sickness like a really bad cold.
-1	I have had many family members with health issues. For example my mother has diabetes and high blood pressure. My grandmother has emphazema, asthma, and other health issues that I have had to learn to treat.
1	My 92 year old mom recently fell on concrete. She had no outward signs of broken bones and was conscious and cognitively astute. There was a tremendous amount of bleeding. I felt it best to call an EMS vehicle to get her to the hospital being that she takes Pradaxa, a blood thinner. 
1	I had never had a urinary tract infection, but I began having unusual symptoms on urination. When I went to the doctor, I suspected that he might test my urine for evidence of infection. He did.
1	I saw an accident once and the guy was having some blood loss from his arm. I knew from my first aid training that stopping the flow of blood coming out was a good first step in a situation like that. I got the guy to hold his arm up to minimize the blood loss and tightened a torn shirt around his arm to help until an ambulance arrived.
1	i suffered from acne for several years.  i had worked with a few different dermatologists and tried many different drugs and topical treatments that were recommended to me with little success.  i did some research and discovered that my acne was most likely related to hormones.  i asked my doctor to switch my birth control, which solved my acne problem.  
-1	I don't have much formal training, just bits and pieces picked up over life. This knowledge came in handy when I fell out of a tree as a teenager. I dislocated my shoulder and it really hurt. First off, I knew I had to stay calm, stopped the bleeding and then proceeded to find help.
1	I have spinal issues. A friend was suffering from an injured lower back. She asked what i thought. Based on her symptoms I told her that she should take an anti inflammatory medication as well as a muscle relaxer and then rest for a couple of days. she went to her doctor and her doctor prescribed her an anti inflammatory drug and a muscle relaxer and told her to rest for a week.

1	I once had a colleague that was complaining of joint pain and fatigue. I told him he should get checked for hemochromatosis, since those are both symptoms of the disorder. He had Nordic ancestry so I felt he may be at risk. He got the test and he did have hemochromatosis and credited me with getting the correct diagnosis.
1	I can't think of one. I've been very lucky in that way. I realized my wife had an anxiety disorder thanks to a commercial for Paxil. Her symptoms sounded just like the ones on the commercial. 
-1	One time along time ago when I was a little kid I had to go to the doctor for measles and the doctor thought it was chicken pox but I knew it wasn't so I explained what I knew and how I knew it and why so we could get the correct diagnosis. I think knowing and researching some yourself to help self diagnosis is a major help as doctors are human too and may not always have the correct idea based on your description of the symptoms you are experiencing  and could lead to mistakes being made early in the discussion.
1	When my son had eczema, the doctor just wanted to give him steroid cream and told me there's usually no cure. Instead I had him tested for allergies and found he was allergic to tree nuts. Once we eliminated tree nuts from his diet, the eczema disappeared and has never returned.

1	When my friend was pregnant and was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia I was able to guide her through the process based off when I had it myself. I explained that if blood pressure is elevated, and that if you lay on your left side and it is still elevated, you are at risk for eclampsia and therefore might be induced at 38 weeks like me.
-1	I have been taking care of all my family medical forms, records, doctor visits, etc. That includes my elderly mother who has had many health issues and several surgeries. I filled out all the paperwork, talked to doctors for her and helped her make decisions.
1	Over the past year I've developed headaches and sensations of dizziness seemingly at random. after going to doctor after doctor I landed up at a neurology office. I then learned I have an issue with my spine that causes these symptoms.

-1	My son was very sick 2 years ago.  He had complications from pneumonia.  He was in and out of the hospital and we switched hospitals when the first one wasnt helping him.  I lost a lot of faith in Doctors after that.
-1	I had a time in my life where i could not see right, i could not walk right, I in general was just having a lot of issues. I found out I had NMO
1	There was a time when I knew I knew how to self diagnose myself medically. I had been having really sharp abdominal pains under my right bottom rib cage area. I looked up all my symptoms I have been having everything and I thought I had gallbladder issues. Well, I ended up going to the ER. After several tests, I turned out to be right. I had to have my gallbladder removed.
1	I had once had really bad cellulitis in my elbow region. At the time nobody knew what it was and thought I got stung by a bug or something. I knew it wasn't that and researched a lot of different possibilities. I knew I was right and I was as I was told I got cellulitis once I got to the ER.
1	"I felt sick as a dog, had sore throat and was exhausted. I went to the doctor's and he said I was fine. I went home and became sicker. I went back to the doctor's and he said I was fine. I went home again and researched my symptoms: Epstein-Barr and strep throat were the results. I marched back to my doctor's office and said, "" I have  the Epstein Barr virus and strep throat--I need antibiotics for the strep throat and a note to be excused from work so that I can rest""--and that's what I finally got from the doctor."
1	Whenever I go to the doctor I prepare ahead of time.  I do what research I can online.  I have hypertension so I take blood pressure medicine, and monitor by blood pressure at home.  I have started exercising and eating a healthier diet.  I keep track of all that I do and go prepared with my notebook to the doctor.
1	I have been getting migraines for years.  I did some research and was disappointed to find that they don't know exactly what causes them and that there is really no cure.  I started taking excedrin regularly.  I also had a facial intense pulsed light ipl treatment that made me have migraines nearly every day.  I went to the chiropracter because I though my posture and neck alignment may be contributing to neck tension and pain.  This could be leading to frequent headaches.  I wanted to continue with the chiropracter but I cannot at this time due to money issues.  I started getting what I believe were intenstinal ulcers from the excedrin, particularly the NSAIDs.  It put me in extreme pain and cramping for days which I could not get rid of.  I went to see an emergency doctor who gave me pills to stop the cramps in my intenstine.  My sister had the same issue a few years later.  I found out my whole family gets migraines at a family reunion.  I started doing more research and found out inflammation could be a cause.  I started taking turmeric supplements for inflammation.  Within a month I had significantly fewer migraines and headaches.  Now I recommend it to all the women I meet who have migraines, many many women do.
-1	my wife had a stomach pain and she started bleeding we thought its normal to bleed a little during pregnancy but later we realised it was a miscarriage and the result showed possible chance of uterine cancer
1	I was hit and run by a car while riding my bike. I had no radial pulse, lost memory, had multiple broken bones, and was 1mm away from being paralyzed. In addition, my lungs were filling with fluid. I learned a lot about the anatomy of my back, my lungs and what a radial pulse was.  I learned the treatment plans for my conditions and what could be done and what could not be done. Previously, I had no experience in these areas. I had to trust the doctors and what literature they provided to educate myself. It was a long recovery with still remaining issues that I continue to seek treatment and get educated about the body and recovery.
-1	My experiences have been to listen to my body, as I'm getting older I realize that if you pay attention to the seasonal, cyclical, and redundant reactions to changes, you will begin to learn your own body better than any other person; you can learn to trust it.
1	I accompanied my mom to get screened for breast cancer and she was given information about what to do to avoid ever having it
1	I had started coughing and had a slight pain in my throat after work one day. The next morning i looked in the back of my throat and lucky me i found some white puss pockets right around my lymph nodes. I immediately identified this as strep and made an appointment with my doctor. 
1	I recently moved and therefore, had no doctor.  I twisted my ankle very badly.  The pain was excruciating and the bruising encompassed my entire foot and went well up my leg.  I didn't really want to pay an ER bill so I took a wait and see attitude.  I felt safe in doing so because I could move my toes a little, and because I did get a little better daily.  I was soon confident that I had no broken bones.  My husband had a 50 percent tendon tear in the past, and knowing what that was like, and how it was treated helped.
-1	I have medical knowledge about asthma and how to care for people with it. I have dealt with having it my whole life.
-1	I had a nose bleed that would not stop. I remembered how a paramedic once told me, in order to stop a nose bleed; you place a gauze under the inner lip and apply some pressure until the bleeding stops. I always thought you lean your head bank until the bleeding stops. It worked like a charm when I did it the medics way.
1	I went through a health care track in college and had two years of specialized school for Medical Technology.  There you learn about hematology, microbiology, chemical biology, etc., which has given me a large understanding of medical fields.  In addition, I work in the healthcare informatics field so I am constantly exposed to these scenarios.
1	When I took a health psychology class I had to be familiar with certain health and medical issues for the class
1	In my mid-20s I began experiencing wheezing and shortness of breath during certain periods of time. I recognized the danger of pulmonary issues and sought medical advice, I was subsequently diagnosed with asthma.

1	An experience I had that showed my knowledge of health or medical issues is when I took my son to the doctor's office. I had remembered reading about certain signs the body gives away that are an indication of other issues during my studying in the medical field. My son was having a high fever and sweating a little and I figured he was teething because he was also drooling. Sure enough, I was correct when I talked to the doctor about it. He told me that I was absolutely right. 
1	My mother was recently treated for breast cancer and just had her third of four chemotherapy sessions. She was initially told that she would not need chemo at all and would just have to do radiation to lower the rate of recurrence after the tumor and a lymph node was removed, and then a month later she had to very quickly reschedule, messing up work and therefore putting her insurance at risk. All of the complaints I've given you so far are incredibly fresh in my mind.
-1	Last year I was diagnosed with diabetes.  I have lowered by A1C from 6.5 to 5.9 all by myself with diet.  I am now conscious of everything I put in my mouth.  I check my blood sugar every morning and 2 hours after a meal that I feel will raise my blood sugar. 
-1	Welp, I'm obviously not very good with the numbers! However, as a bipolar person I have extensive knowledge of my mental illness. I can see when I'm starting to go through cycles and am able to change my behavior accordingly. 
1	My husband has type 2 diabetes so I had to learn how to help him manage it to keep his blood sugar under control.  I had to learn about the condition and also about the signs to look for when his sugar is too high or too low.
1	My wife felt lumps in her breast. From my medical knowledge I knew that the firm nodule tha was easily moved was likely a cyst. The other one had a chance to be malignant so she had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I could see during the X-rays that the lump was not characteristic of a cancer. Then, during ultrasound I could see the round black hole on the screen indicating all lumps wee cysts. Was able to relieve both me and the wife while we waited for the radiologist to tell us the same thing.
1	When my father was found to need a blood thinner I did the research to understand the different medications he could take along with the side effects.  When I asked the doctor about the different medications, we both agreed on one.
-1	I went to and graduated from nursing school. That's not enough characters, so I'll add that it was a hospital school (they're long gone) so I'm a diploma nurse. I graduated in 1974 and left nursing in 1985.
1	I knew when I was pregnant the first morning after I had conceived because I felt different upon my walk to work the next morning. It seemed as though everything I was used to doing took a lot of extra effort. I kept this to myself for several weeks until I was able to take a test and confirm that my personal diagnose was correct.

1	When I had blood in my stool, I looked up the symptom online and determined I most likely had hemorrhoids.  I went to the doctor anyways because it could have been more serious.  They listened to my description of the problem (I did not change it to match the online symptoms because I didn't really have any pain) and they prescribed me fiber and told me that if it continued or became diahrrea-like to come back immediately.  I took the fiber and shortly after I no longer saw blood in my stool.
1	I really can't think of a situation. I depend on my doctor for info. If I don't know something I seek out resources to help me.
1	Two years ago I had my first UTI. I understood the symptoms as everyone knows the basic symptom of pain while peeing as well as the frequent feeling of having to go to the bathroom. Instead of having to go to the doctors I called the 24 hour nurse service and told them I believed that I had a UTI. I then asked for the antibiotics and after confirming I had the specific symptoms I was approved. I didn't need to go to a doctor for this because I understood the symptoms that I was having 
1	I went to college for five years to become a clinical laboratory scientist. We learned a lot about the different disorders that affect the blood cells and other bodily fluids. We did not learn as much on the symptoms or treatments for all disorders. I feel working in this field now for the past year and seeing the patients in a clinic setting has helped me to learn more and more everyday that I come in to work.  
-1	After years of taking care of my grandmother's medications, when her doctor wanted to ignore her odd behavior, I made it clear in no uncertain terms that her medication could not be the cause of it, and if he started messing with it, her diabetes would become unstable.

1	I really don't have much experience with health issues.  i just paid attention in high school health class. Sometimes I read articles online if I feel curious about the subject.
1	This is a weird and difficult question to answer. I went through a period of 6 months where my doctors believed I had early onset rheumatory arthritis.

1	When I went to the Emergency Department at UF Shands, the doctor assigned to me was unconvinced that I needed to be admitted.

Asshole.

1	I have costochondritis, inflammation of the rib cage. I spent a year feeling really horrible and not knowing what the problem was. I started suffering from very bad health anxiety, went to the ER a few times thinking that I was having a heart attack or dying.

After almost a year of researching and trying everything to get better, I learned about costochondritis and finally got a diagnosis. 
1	Well about 10 years ago I experienced a staph infection on my leg that needed to be treated.  At the time I the cost to have it treated was well beyond my means as I was between jobs and my co-pay was infeasible. Luckly I knew to process of dealing with such an infection was to remove the core from the boil, disinfect the wound, place a drain, then cover it up and request some antibiotics.  I was able to lance the boil and do all the treatment work (I have a very high tolerance for pain) and requested my doctor prescribe some antibiotics.  When I arrived at the office he examined the treated wound and told me he was impressed I was able to do that myself and that it looked as good as the work he would have done.  He did suggest I let a professional do it next time as I could have hurt myself but still I managed to treat it myself.
-1	I've had issues where my tongue gets inflamed and swollen for reasons I still do not understand. Most doctors look at my tongue and focus on the top portion. I have what is called a geographical tongue. It has an odd design and looks cracked and spaced apart on the surface, kind of like the landmasses on the earth. Most doctors have not even heard of this and focus on that, as though it is part of, or the reason for the inflammation. This is one area in which I actually know more than the doctors, and frustrates me when they wont listen to my explanation.

-1	My grandmother had dibeties and when I was 17 she went to get her toe nails cut by her podiatrist. He cut her toenail too short and she developed an infection. I was able to clean her foot, apply ointment and dressed her wound. I did this for a few days with no improvement. When I went to do the same thing the next day, it clearly was getting worse. I advised my grandmother that it looks like gangrene and she should go get it checked. She did and was admitted to the hospital for gangrene. They would normally take the toe but because of her age they highly recommended we didn't opt for that solution. They ended up injecting her with some type of solution and gave her an antibiotic and dressed the wound. Whatever they did stopped the infection and she lived for two more years after that incident and passed away due to other reasons unrelated to the toe

1	Let's take flu shots.  I have opted out of getting a flu shot.  I have never had one before, however this year I was tempted.  I understand that the flu shot is only about 17-18% effective in preventing the flu.  This number is not very high.  I also understand what they are telling us is that even if we get the flu, the severity would be reduced if we were to get a flu shot.  Since the flu appears so prevalent this year I am tempted, but I have taken the recommendations into consideration, along with the stats and have decided I would take my chances again this year and not get a flu shot. We'll see what next year brings.

1	I fell and cut my knee pretty badly. I washed the wound thoroughly and bandaged it.

-1	One night when I was eating dinner at a restaurant, a man fell out of his chair onto the floor. He was unresponsive. Someone called 911 and I got up to watch and see what was happening. The lady on the phone yelled out if anyone knew CPR and to start doing it now. None volunteered and I coulldn't believe none of these people knew CPR or didnt want to do it. I felt like it was my responsibility to step up since I had taking several CPR Advanced classes.
-1	There's been times where I was at the hospital and I was already suspecting myself to have POTS.

1	Well for a long time I kept getting a burning in my chest. Doctor and I were not sure what was causing it. Initially we both thought it was bronchitis as I also had trouble breathing. After inhalers and steroids didn't help, we thought it might be heartburn, as I've had history of acid reflux and stomach issues. So after being on prilosec for a bit, I noticed I still had the burning in my chest. It was then I noticed that it occurred when my heartrate went up. So after informing my Doctor of this, we knew it was heart related, and pin pointed the issue.

I ate a diverse diet and made sure I had at least the recommended amount of each most days. When I had to get a blood test done 5 years later, everything was normal. I'd like to think that the care I took about planning my meals contributed to that.

I got our RA for the building to come look at her, and she called an ambulance because my roommate's condition was getting worse. I remembered those symptoms from my mother's kidney stone the previous year, and figured that might be what the issue was. We called my roommate's parents and they thought it might be appendicitis, but I was pretty sure about the kidney stone. My roommate rarely drank water but was otherwise healthy. I of course let the medical professionals do their work and didn't posit any theories, but I was right in the end.

I started doing research on possible causes one possible cause took my attention. I knew because of other unrelated testing, that my iron was low, and in my research, a possible cause showed that low iron could be responsible for webs forming in the throat area. During my follow up meeting I asked the Dr. about this and after he ordered additional blood work, he confirmed that it was my iron-levels were the reason for the obstruction. He prescribed iron and I have not had to go back since.

Within 6 months I was 90% recovered and by 18 months I felt 100% again.
1	I think the most important way that I have displayed my knowledge is by taking care of family members who have become ill. It is very important to watch children closely when they have an illness because their life could be in danger. The scariest moment was when my son had a fever and I knew to bath him to help bring down his temperature.

It was very disturbing because I didn't know what my outcome was going to be. However, I was able to make it there on time and get sorted out while the doctors giving me prescription to help ease the pain.

Sure enough a few days later he had a heart attack. Luckily I was watching over him and I reacted quickly and got him to a hospital in time to control the situation.
1	The more often a person is prescribed antibiotics the less effective they will be.  When I do have sinusitis that is bad enough to make me actually see a doctor (feeling like I am dying) I have to tell them not to bother writing a script for amoxicillin because I won't bother filling it as it will not work, it's like eating a bottle of Tic Tacs for me at this point.

My younger sister (age 62) is blind from the effects of sugar diabetes. My brother died in 1999 at the age of 39 from cirrhosis of the liver. With all this going on, I've always been aware that I want to be healthy. It's not easy. I weight 184, 5 foot 2, work at a very physical job which benefits me.

1	Having a baby definitely made me more knowledgeable. From start to finish, I learned about my changing body and building a baby inside of me. Many things were different after I had the baby and learning about the signs and things to look for on a growing baby or just sickness in general. You learn a lot becoming a parent so it definitely makes you pretty familiar with medical issues.
-1	I worked on a icu step down unit in a local hospital where many times I was involved with caring for high risk patients. You have to be alert and aware to even be employed by this unit. Also I own my own licensed massage therapy business and have been in practice 15 years

1	I don't consider myself to be especially knowledgeable in health or medical issues. I have general knowledge in the areas of nutrition from a class I took in college. I try to choose healthier options when I go grocery shopping because of that like ground turkey over ground beef. I know sitting for extended periods of time is bad for you, so I try to get up and walk around every hour or so (I work an office job). In terms of medical problems I have gone straight to the doctor for a mole that started to look abnormal because I know that can mean cancer. For the most part I just try to make sure I take all preventive measures and get all required tests for my gender and age group.
1	in some point of my life, I have learned and read a lot of medicine and medical diseases, and in one situations i got a bad cold and i knew it and i took the cure about my self
1	Almost every instance I can think of demonstrates my *lack* of knowledge, so this is a hard question. But I've kept my husband alive through 30 years of a still-undiagnosed progressive neuromuscular disorder (he was diagnosed at first with ALS, and it looks a lot like that). I've taken him to emergency for what's turned out to be pericarditis, and for TIAs. I talk to his doctors. He's still alive, so there's that.

He told me he needed to get a massage because he has a personal trainer and his muscles felt sore and weak. I asked him if that was normal or did it just start recently. I asked if it started around when his insurance stopped paying for crestor. He said now that you mention it, it did! I said it is probably your new cholesterol drug because statins have a tendency to cause muscle weakness or aching. So his doctor filled out a prior authorization detailing the effect of the drug they recommended and he went back to his crestor and the muscle issues went away. 
-1	I take the time to discuss my health with my doctor. I also see my nurse clinic each month for a BP check. My health website has a lot of information on wellness and preventive care.

1	One experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues involved a group of friends and myself hanging out. The guys in the group were being rambunctious and wrestling inside the house (something which was not recommended). At one point, one of the guys tripped and fell hitting his head on the corner of the television. It immediately began bleeding and he was unsure as to what he should do so he immediately came to me. My suggestion was to first stop the bleeding (apply slight pressure to the area), check his cognitive functioning/vision, and make sure he didn't fall asleep, and stay positive/encouraging so he would not panic. After a little while the bleeding stopped and we further assessed his state. I gave him ibuprofen and continued to monitor his state for the next couple of hours making sure that he knew we could go to the hospital if need be.
1	When friends of mine are mixing recreational drugs, I can tell them if that is relatively safe or not. For example, I make sure my friends never combine 2 or more GABAergics.

I talked to the Head of oncology and he advised which oncologist she should see.   She lived 10 more years.
1	often times when I have a non-medical emergency I simply take care of the injury or illness myself. most of my knowledge has come from past experience and some actual education. this in turn gives me the ability to handle most small medical problems that I encounter throughout my life. Some of the more severe actions I have often look for assistance from another person close by.

I feel that my experience and knowledge is always growing, regardless of what I have known in the passed

1	One time in life that demonstrated my knowledge about medical issues is when I made a home remedy to kill my cold. I use peroxide, lemon juice,  baking soda,  and some salt.

Algebra ahh Here's some random crap off the internet Medicine (British English Listeni/ËmÉdsáµ»n/; American English Listeni/ËmÉdáµ»sáµ»n/) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[1][2] The word ""medicine"" is derived from Latin medicus, meaning ""a physician"".[3][4] Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[5] Medicine has existed for thousands of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science. Prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine. They remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. For example, evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is ""variable and inconsistent"" for any condition,[6] but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner.[7] In contrast, treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery."

Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples m.

-1	Relating effectively with patients is among the most valued skills of clinical care. As a beginning clinician, you will focus your energies on gathering information. At the same time, by using techniques that promote trust and convey respect, you will allow the patientâs story to unfold in its most full and detailed form. Establishing a supportive interaction helps the patient feel more at ease when sharing information and itself becomes the foundation for therapeutic clinicianâpatient relationships. 4 Because illness can make patients feel discouraged and isolated, âA feeling of connectedness with the doctor, of being deeply heard and understood, reduces this feeling of isolation and despair. This feeling is the very heart of healing

One of those feelings you can't explain. I decided to just keep an eye on him while we were feeding the turtles. I would look his way often and noticed he had moved his wheelchair into a different position. I continued to observe him, but I looked away for a few minutes. Next thing I know he was lying prone on the ground. It appeared that he was grabbing at a tree to pull himself up. That did it for me and I went over to offer my assistance. When I got to him he refused my help. And I realized he was using the tree to push himself to the water. He was going to commit suicide. I used my knowledge of depression (I have suffered through my own recurrent depression for 20 years) and began talking to him and listening to him all while trying to physically hold him still. I became his friend for those moments he really needed someone. I may have been the one who saved his life, but God gave me the calm and physical strength to hold him until some more help arrived.

-1	"When the government inverted the food pyramid in the early 1990s, I told my children to ignore it. Replacing proteins, fats, etc with carbohydrates would create US epidemics of diabetes and obesity in the US -- it has. 75% of the brain is myelin, myelin is 100% cholesterol. Statin drugs inhibit liver production of cholesterol, creating our epidemic of Swiss cheese-brained cadavers from Alzheimer's disease. A 6.4 cent 100 mcg vitamin K tablet - size of saccharin tablet - prevents required blood serum calcium and blood  serum cholesterol from bonding at the molecular level into vessel plaque. When I had to tell a doctor that I had a strep throat, he took a culture, then didn't know what to prescribe because I'm allergic to penicillin. His PDR was no help to him, and he finally asked me what was usually prescribed for me, and wrote the prescription after again checking the PDR for correct dosage by weight, after asking me my weight. I was 20 at the time. Want more? Despite foreknowledge of both grandmothers dying of uterine hemorrhage and special care being taken for my first two deliveries, I suffered a uterine hemorrhage with my third child and ""died"" and I'm here only because I responded positively to resuscitation. Further idiocy? Second hand smoke was disproved in 1999, but they keep beating that dead horse. I smoked a pack of Marlboro reds throughout all three pregnancies, and gave birth to healthy, perfect, over 8 pound babies, a girl and two boys. Start looking for the correct reasons -- like minerals missing from the diet because they're never replaced in arable soil -- for birth defects."

I lost 100 pounds, my doctor never told me I needed to lose weight, just that she was proud of me for making the choice myself and she has found that a doctor can't make someone lose weight just by telling them they have to, the person had to want to. But I lost my health insurance due to the new Marketplace health insurance deal and I couldn't do to the doctors anymore, I have started gaining weight back. I realize that I need someone with me encouraging me and giving me ideas on what I can do like my doctor did without forcing it onto me. "
