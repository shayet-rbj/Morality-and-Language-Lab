0.238100	Not knowing what is going on and how bad it will be.
0.714300	I am worried about finding out any bad news. I also worry about the staff being rude or uncaring.
0.500000	That they might find something wrong with me
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. I love going to the doctor's office and love interacting with the medical team. 
0.809500	I am always worried about the outside chance that I may develop a serious condition, like heart disease.
0.714300	hearing bad news.  Sometimes I think ignorance is bliss.
0.428600	I just always feel a little bit concerned that the doctor might find something bad (cancer, a need for surgery, a health condition.)
0.952400	Just the general idea of going to the doctor makes me uneasy.  I do not know why I feel this way but it is always like this.  I even just make the appointment and I get super anxious.
0.452400	Just the process
0.523800	I'm afraid of hospitals due to my childhood. I had to visit them a lot, so that gets me anxious already. I feel like I'm going to mess something up.
0.642900	I dislike the smell of the office. I feel nervous when I see sick people.
0.428600	I get anxious that something will be wrong with me I always worry about that when I go
0.571400	I worry that I will get news that I am afflicted with some disease.
0.761900	They are going to tell me I'm going to die soon
0.190500	I'm almost never anxious or worried, but as I get older, there's always the chance that the doctor will find or notice something that I haven't. I'm a good weight for my height, but I don't exercise much, so eventually I'm sure he'll tell me I have high blood pressure or cholesterol, but that hasn't happened yet.
0.428600	nothing really just the quiet setting 
0.976200	that they are going to put me back in a mental health institution. I don't like going there. They have cookies though, and ice cream. but no smoking. 
0.285700	I'm usually not anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's office. 
0.666700	That I'm going to get a lecture about my weight.  Also that I might have to have a shot.
0.357100	I always expect something major to be wrong.  Haven't had that happen yet, but I just always assume bad news is coming.
0.428600	I sometimes worry about whether or not I am presenting myself properly. I am worried that I may not be able to give all the information I need to in order to make my doctor be well informed.
0.309500	I worry that something could be wrong with me but usually don't have anxiety over it.
0.285700	I am not terribly anxious or worried, but I do think that there needs to be more open communication. There's a paterlistic attitude sometimes. Be open.
0.238100	I am just an anxious person to begin with so I always get anxious if I feel something might be wrong
0.238100	Just the process of going to the doctor.  I get nervous about giving blood and the overall exam process.
0.547600	Waiting for the doctor and fear of judgement.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried, because I'm not a worrier.  Maybe about how much it will cost....
0.476200	I usually go to the doctor only when I have a health issue. Sometimes I get worried that I might have a serious condition or am getting worse
0.285700	I do not feel any of this
0.357100	It's uncomfortable to be that vulnerable.
0.619000	Generally I don't go to the doctor unless I know something is wrong, so it's the wondering what the problem is 
0.571400	the visit in general. I don't want to hear bad news
0.142900	When I go to find out something is wrong I am usually nervous but for a regular check up I am usually at ease.
0.357100	I have hypertension, so I am most often worried that I have not done enough to control it and my BP may be high when I am there.
0.619000	"I'm always worried that I will do or say the wrong thing and be a ""bad"" patient. I have issues with anxiety surrounding being a ""bad"" person or doing something ""wrong""."
0.261900	I don't really get anxious or worried, I just get bored with the long wait and the hassle of it.  The only time I've felt anxious at a doctor's office was when I was getting my cheek biopsy because they were thinking it was skin cancer (it was). And then the surgery and reconstructive surgeries made me feel anxious because I was worried about scarring.
0.452400	If I need to get blood drawn or get shots. Anything painful. Or anything uncomfortable to talk about. 
0.571400	That I might have something wrong with me that could be bad.
0.333300	I am some sometimes anxious if I think I am overweight and not been eating or working out like I should
0.619000	Mostly relatively minor phobias about things like needles.
0.714300	Being sicker than I can handle.
0.238100	sometimes I am scared of the news I may receive. I have a lot of health issues so I get worried. I do not get worried about my doctor, but at the news I may get. 
0.381000	I always get anxious when going for something that is hurting, or my anxiety because I think that they all think I just want pills or something like that. So, instead I deal with a lot of pain and anxiety, because of the anxiety it causes me to ask about it. Its a horrible anxious loop.
0.381000	Just the uncertainty if I have a major illness that is going to kill me
0.595200	I'm afraid that they will try to force me to get a procedure that I don't want. 
1.000000	That I'm not getting the best help possible. That my doctor is so preoccupied with what's wrong with his next patient or the one in the other room that I know he's go back and forth between that he's not paying the least bit attention to what is going on in my room. 
0.904800	They will hurt me in the examination process or will be unkind to me and not believe me when I explain issues I have with my health.
0.214300	In general I think it is just something that everyone feels when they go to a doctors office.  You are just fearful of what they will say it is just the general fear of the unknown
0.571400	My medical condition, if I think it is serious
0.142900	Finding something wrong
0.238100	Having to wait a long time for service. 
0.666700	They will rush me through. There is a large population here. In my small town growing up everyone knew everyone. I went to church with my doctor. Here all they want to know is what kind of insurance you have. Usually they don't take mine. I just don't go and treat myself. I avoid vaccinations and unnecessary treatments. 
0.547600	The waiting times which happen and you are in a check up room alone. 
0.285700	Their incompetence. I take care of a (non-family) disabled adult. Many doctors appointments are just terrible for them, because the doctors seem incompetent and inept. So that person doesn't want to see the doctors because they know it will be stressful.
0.142900	The long wait at times.
0.666700	The idea that he might find something really wrong with me. I worry about contracting a terrible disease.
0.571400	Afraid if there's going be a long wait.
0.547600	I feel the most anxious about getting my blood pressure tested. 
0.142900	I mildly dislike needles, and poking around in my private areas is more annoying than embarrassing, but I get over the annoyance and look away when they do the blood draw.
0.238100	most likely the unknown of what exactly is wrong. 
0.500000	Mostly, I am an anxious person in general. Plus, I'm always a bit worried that something will show up that is wrong with me. Doctors offices in general make me a bit anxious.
0.333300	I dont like to give blood. I get dizzy so that bothers me sometimes. I also get anxious waiting for the blood test results at times
0.571400	I'm worried that something may be wrong with me!
0.714300	I fear the end result or diagnosis.
0.238100	Waiting on the dr to arrive in the room and then not knowing what the outcome will be of your symptoms.  Also can get nervous when waiting on him to provide you with test results.  It's an uneasy feeling.
0.857100	I don't want to be touched really. After that, I don't want to hear anything bad.
0.500000	I am always afraid that they will find something wrong with my health and it will lead to death. It is fear of the unknown.
0.547600	i am just curious. i want to know what help i will need. I also want to know if there is something i should be concerned about
0.714300	Discovering a medical condition that may be unbeknownst to me. 
0.619000	that something will be wrong and it is unexpected.
0.714300	I am very paranoid and I feel that things never work out for me. I always dread and fear the worst,
0.738100	I don't like doctor's offices, needles, or exams. Anything out of my normal routine makes me nervous.
0.738100	I find it most uneasy the thought that they will find something serious wrong with me, and even worse, what this problem will end up costing me, both emotiolly and fincially.  I worry that any treatments will simply be out of my budget.
0.881000	Going to a doctor could always mean something bad. You never know what you're going to find out when you're there. So it makes me fearful every time I go to one
0.381000	I have anxiety.  I don't like interacting with people.  I'm a private person. I don't like discussing what's wrong wit me.
0.452400	I just am always curious what is going on with my body and I am hopeful that it isn't too serious. I don't know what they are planning once I get into the exam room. So, this sense of unease leads to some anxiety.
0.142900	I sometimes feel anxious that I will be waiting in the exam room forever, especially when I have other plans after the appointment.
0.857100	getting bad new about my health, getting a shot
0.142900	No, I never worry.
0.714300	I am most anxious about hearing bad news. I am worried that something would pop up positive on tests. 
0.500000	Anticipation of unpleasant news. Usually not an issue. Occaisolly though, you go in worried to begin with.
0.476200	just that they will find something i dont know about or wont truly listen to me
0.357100	The only thing would be the uncertainty. Not knowing what my problem is. 
0.142900	I'm never really anxious when I go to the doctor. The only thing that would make me anxious is if I was experiencing horrible pain but didn't know where it came from 
0.428600	Probably just that I am worried that there's something wrong or that it's worse than I imagined. 
0.142900	Blood work or additiol studies that might be needed and take a few hours for results. 
0.595200	It's most worrisome when you don't know what the results are going to be. It could be bad or it could be good, you don't really know what you're going to hear. Most of the times it ends up being good so worrying is probably unnecessary.
0.166700	I am not really anxious about seeing a doctor because I feel it is better to take care of any problems right away rather than waiting for them to get worse.
0.642900	I just hate the whole experience. I think it's the attitude of the doctors. They seem like they are better than you. I get super nervous.
0.904800	I worry about whether I am going to die. I believe if I'd had more money I would have had better care. I do not get to choose my Dr. I have to go where my insurance will be accepted and these Dr.'s are always different. I never see the same one twice. A few years ago everyone had a family Dr. who knew them all their lives. No longer. 
0.404800	Un unknown illness or condition.
0.428600	Potential of the doctor finding health problems.
0.476200	That something might be wrong.
1.000000	I am most scared I am going to get a death sentence. I have really bad health anxiety.
0.642900	They probably aren't qualified to do what they do. They are LARPing.
0.142900	What makes me anxious is the anticipation. I don't know if I have something wrong with me or not.
0.547600	The cost
0.809500	Being around people, having to discuss problems. 
0.142900	Nothing generally makes me worried other than the thought that something might be serious wrong with me.
0.500000	That they won't take me seriously. 
0.761900	I feel worried because I'm a very secretive and self-reliant person. Visiting the doctor is all about depending on someone else and letting them examine and judge you. I don't trust them not to reveal my persol information to anyone they see fit, even if I would strongly object.
0.142900	Nothing usually. I am generally very comfortable visiting the doctor. 
0.642900	I worry about what is wrong with me. The doctor doesn't make me feel this way, and I am hoping whatever is wrong isn't serious. It's just the whole waiting game I guess.
0.809500	"I don't like most examitions especially the ones that invade much of my ""privacy"" as far as private parts. That always makes me nervous. It's just not a good feeling to have the doctor look at parts that are usually not disclosed unless to an intimate partner."
0.785700	I am anxious that my doctor will criticize my lifestyle or my habits without seeing me as a person. I am worried that my doctor will not listen to me. I am worried that something will be wrong with me.
0.214300	I have had some medical isseus in the past and I always worry it may come up again 
0.785700	Having someone exam my body and tell me that I'm unhealthy. 
0.142900	I'm not sure if it counts, since it doesn't actually relate to the actual doctor's office, but the drive over there makes me feel the most anxious.  I have panic attacks when I drive and I really hate to drive because of it.  If that doesn't count, I guess the only anxiety I would feel is if my doctor wasn't in that day since they have three different doctors and I only like him.
0.595200	I feel the most anxious about how much money it will cost me when I'm there. If I'm told I have a serious medical affliction, I practically have to accept my death. This is understandably unsettling to cope with, and thus I to an extent don't want to visit a doctor for this reason.
0.809500	What kind of tests will they have to do? Will they hurt? Will it be expensive? What if they find something serious? Will I have to have surgery? How will that alter my way of life? Do I have the time in the day to tend to all of this? 
0.333300	I worry that I won't get the full attention of the doctor and won't get all my questions answered. 
0.761900	I want to live forever, but as I get closer to 40, I've had a few more issues.  I hate that I now have to start getting rectal exams and things like that.  I just don't ever want to get bad news.
0.690500	When I have a bad feeling about a test result or something negative that my doctor will tell me. Also, when my doctor doesn't support my ideas or beliefs or doesn't trust me.
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. 
0.357100	Not knowing what will happen.  Not always taken good care of myself
0.142900	I DONT LIKE TO HAVE A FINGER STUCK UP MY BUTT
0.666700	The impending case of my pain, or if I may have something I do not know about. 
0.142900	If I felt I had a loss of life sickness I might be nervous, but otherwise I'm never nervous.
0.142900	Lack of compassion and understanding. Also, acknowledging the existance of chronic Lyme disease at some point would be nice. 
0.166700	Being weighed and having my blood pressure taken is usually nerve-wracking. I have struggled with my weight all my life, and the last couple years my blood pressure has not been stable.
0.571400	Having to wait for so long in waiting room. Then having to wait in examition room. My mind wanders and too much free time and quiet is not good when I am at a doctor visit. I don't want to be told anything is wrong with me.
0.238100	Fear of my health getting worse.
0.285700	It doesn't really apply because I'm not anxious or worried when I go for appointments.
0.571400	It's an unfamiliar environment and people usually go to the doctor's office when there is something wrong with them healthwise or they are afraid something could be wrong. The uncertainty is likely what causes me the most anxiety.
0.714300	That they will cause me more harm than good. 
0.666700	I start imaging the awful diagnosis that he could discover, like cancer. 
0.142900	Nothing does, I have no anxiety when visiting a doctor.
0.142900	I would feel anxious not knowing the outcome of the visit. It would scare me to find out that I have a problem with my health.
0.190500	Pap smears.  It's just an awkward situation, though what actually gets me is it can hurt LIKE HELL.  I'm pretty good with pain, it's necessary so I shrug it off, but it's certainly not something I look forwards to in any way, shape, or form.
0.928600	That they'll find something really wrong.
0.571400	I'm done writing pal, this is ridiculous for the pay.  
0.285700	Getting test results for things that i'd rather not knows, for which if the results are bad it's totally going to be my fault cause I made bad decisions in  my past.
0.142900	I only feel anxious or worried when I know I am about to receive a shot.
0.238100	Them finding something bad.  ALso, something that may be uncomfortable physically, like a shot or a procedure.
0.666700	I am worried I will go home still not knowing what is wrong with me.
0.595200	Just that I never know what they are going to say. Also that I may not agree with what they say or they may want me to do things I don't want to do. It's just that unforseen things can happen.
0.142900	idk why but the only thing that makes me a little anxious is having my blood pressure checked. For some reason when the cup goes on my anxiety shoots up and they always have to retake my blood pressure a second time.
0.857100	possibility of their being something seriously wrong with me; judgement from the doctor.
0.309500	Just the fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether the doctor will find somethng wrong with me, and if he does find something wrong, how serious will the condition be. 
0.761900	I'm always anxious for any stranger to look at me in depth like that, whether it's a doctor, dentist, or person on the bus. It's very intrusive and unsettling. I'm also worried that my doctor will give me bad news or even worse will refer me without telling me why and it will take weeks to learn what's wrong with me.
0.142900	the fear of the unknown
0.452400	Whether my condition is more serious than I expected
0.428600	I worry that something minor will turn out to be something major. I'm not a hypochondriac, and I don't worry about stuff all the time. It's just that health can be complicated sometimes.
0.714300	When I am just waiting for the results from everything.  My mind will keep thinking of the worst outcome until I hear a solid response.
0.142900	I am not anxious or worried ever when going to the dr. 
0.904800	I worry they aren't gon be able to help me. I also worry that it could be something bad.
0.357100	I'm turally anxious, so I feel that way about most new/unusual experiences.
0.142900	I am in good health so I really do not have any concerns when I visit.  The only thing that makes me anxious is when I have to wait for a long time to get called to the back.
0.285700	I don't really get anxious or worried when I go to the doctors.  It doesn't make me worried unless they tell me something is wrong with me.
0.309500	That I will forget to ask something or tell them something that is relevant. 
0.285700	Just having to deal with answering lots of questions and getting tests, etc.
0.142900	I don't usually feel nervous or anxious. I am generally calm. 
1.000000	I feel that the doctor is judging me and my lifestyle and will be harsh and critical of my choices.
0.619000	I am worried about a potential health problem that I might have that was previously unknown by me. A lingering disease or illness is a scary thought. I also sometimes worry about the costs. 
0.333300	I would be worried that there could be something seriously wrong with me during a visit.  Especially when I've been experiencing pain or unusual symptoms.
0.214300	I get anxious when I have to get weighed because I already know I have to lose weight. I also get anxious when I need to have blood taken or I may be worried if I am waiting for some type of results. 
0.738100	I have health conditions which could lead to serious problems. Especially when my doctor is looking for signs of cancer, I'm anxious. I know that it could be bad news for me.
0.428600	I have PTSD and have been nervous talking about it, which is the reason I've most commonly gone to the doctor recently.
0.881000	The anticipation of the exam results is the most nerve wracking. There may be something that I wasn't aware about such as cancer. 
0.690500	blood test. I am terrified of needles and the results.
0.500000	Generally I am worried about the bad news I may receive.  I feel that if I get a bad prognosis then I am doomed to an extremely expensive medical bill as my insurance has a relatively high deductible.
0.452400	I have social anxiety. I feel nervous about interacting with the doctor and staff. I feel inferior.
0.428600	I don't tend to get anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I think if I had a serious medical condition, the not knowing if I was going to get better or worse would make me the most anxious. I don't get nervous for annual check-ups. 
1.000000	im worried about cost. i dont want to go to the doctor because it's expensive. thus, when i do go, I'm worried about what he will find and what it will cost.
0.857100	I don't know, I've always had anxiety going into a doctor's office.
0.976200	I feel the most anxious about visiting a doctor in general because of the dread of the diagnosis.  I am worried about what a doctor will find wrong with me. I am also worried about the fincial burden tests will entail.
0.166700	Seeing if I have gained weight.
0.976200	What may come out of the visit - such as a bad diagnosis.
0.309500	When I am feeling very bad, I worry that it may be something serious.  Also, having to wait in the lobby and then in the room makes me anxious because I sometimes have to wait a long time.   The exam room has no windows and I sometimes feel claustrophobic. 
0.714300	I feel anxious about getting the right service I need. I feel anxious about the cost 
0.142900	The waiting period is difficult. It is hard to sit there and wait for the doctor
0.142900	Nerves in general. No one likes to go to the doctors. But int he long run you know you need to go, even if its for something small. Because that small thing could be something large and if you didnt go something worse could happen to you.
0.214300	Knowing what my weight is.
0.738100	I just get really anxious in general when going to the doctors office. I think it is a combition of something being wrong and I also just don't like the whole waiting environment and all of that. 
0.666700	Part of me worries that they may find some serious medical condition.  I also just find the whole thing awkward in general, sitting there undressed or half dressed.
0.619000	I'm worried about embarrassment, or that something is wrong with me.
0.428600	I would feel anxious if I was in the office to hear results. If i was in for a regular exam or check up I would not have nerves. 
0.619000	I worry about getting bad news.  
0.619000	I feel like I am in good health, but there is always a lingering thought in the back of my mind that he will find something wrong.  It's not a strong feeling, but it's there.
0.476200	Waiting in line, hoping I didn't actually break something. In my wife's case, it was questioning who made the decision to have an OBGYN look at what turned out to not me a problem. I also don't like receiving bad news, which thankfully I largely didn't.
1.000000	I don't like the idea of taking medical tests. I always expect the worst and always thing that my blood work or other related tests will come back bad or that I will be diagnosed with something really bad. I also do not like the very sterile and fluorescent lit environment that Dr offices are in. 
0.619000	I don't like needles and there is always a worry that they will find something that is serious. I worry they will find cancer or something like that when examining me. I don't want to have to battle a serious health issue so I get a little anxious. 
0.238100	Worrying about whether or not something is abnormal or not. If I will need extra testing or other medication.
0.571400	I worry that I will have bad test results or that I will be kept waiting too long
0.595200	The unknown. I like know what's going on in a situation, and the few times that I do need to see a doctor outside of routine visits, it means something is not right and I don't know what's wrong.
0.761900	 I am usually nervous or anxious because it just has a cold environment and you're unsure of what's about to happen 
0.785700	Pain. The thought of being truly sick. Feeling potentially helpless. FEAR OF USEA
0.142900	Only thing I can think of is getting medicine I can't pay for
0.500000	The unknown. Plus, when a doctor has to touch me, sometimes that makes me feel uneasy.
0.595200	Usually when i visit a doctor it is because of a health problem. I am always concerned that it will be something more serious. I also worry about costs and whether I can trust the doctor to offer the best situation.
0.761900	The outcome of what ails me. Is it worse than I thought it would be?
0.285700	NO WORRY
0.523800	I get worried about there being something really wrong with me. I get scared that it will be worse that it seems.
0.309500	The unknown of how any results I am waiting on will come out. 
0.571400	Just the worry of what the doctor says the condition coudl be. I'm also always too nervous to ask many questions.
0.428600	I don't get too anxious at the doctors office unless I feel very sick. In that case I'm usually already worried about my health. 
0.642900	Sometimes I worry that something major is wrong with me (cancer or surgery needed).  I have a lot of chronic pain that I get nervous about when going.
0.285700	Maybe about what could be wrong with me. I get anxious every time I see the doctor and don't really know why. Maybe because I didn't do what I am supposed to do or finish my medication which I am pretty good at.
0.214300	Just the thought of finding something out wrong.
0.952400	I am worried that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. 
0.142900	I'm only worried about catching someone elses sickness when I go to visit the doctor.  I'm not so much worried about myself...what's the point?
0.738100	Being told I'm not healthy.
0.761900	I worry that I will forget past information, that the doctor will not remember what I tell them, or that I will get painful or invasive testing. I worry too about potentially painful or expensive follow up care.
0.714300	I feel anxious that the issues I have that I think are probably relatively smaller problems are the result of a larger issue that needs to be taken care of. I worry whenever I go to the doctor that he will find something serious that can negatively impact my life.
0.285700	I feel most anxious or worried that there will be some bad diagnosis but in general I don't tend to worry about this because I have good health.  I would only worry if I had symptoms that were concerning or alarming, and this has never really happened to me.
0.190500	I would say just not making enough progress on the things I was given advice on last time. It's easy sometimes to hear information in the office, but applying it to daily life can be much more difficult. 
0.381000	I think I am generally uncomfortable with visiting a doctor's office. I have never had a particularly bad experience at a doctor's office, but I find going to appointments to be an unpleasant but necessary thing to do. I am also a bit disturbed by having to share breathing space with other sick people in the waiting room, etc...
0.333300	The potential of my doctor finding that something is wrong with me or that I'm living an unhealthy lifestyle. While I'm generally healthy, I fear that something could change that.
0.547600	I always think the worst possible outcome when I go to the doctor. Because I read all kinds of health information online, I tend to think that I have the illness and my doctor tries to remain optimistic with me and not to think the worst all of the time.
0.595200	I am afraid I will have testing that results in me being put on more medication or that something termil will show up that I've missed

0.571400	That I will be termilly ill or have cancer. I get scared of the lights as well.
0.500000	It's awkward and uncomfortable.
0.142900	I wouldn't say that visiting the doctor in general makes me anxious, but there are certain procedures that I do dislike and cause me to be apprehensive, such as having blood taken, or having to take off clothes. 
0.500000	I don't think I'm actually a hypochondriac, but my mind always shoots to the worst possible scerio when something is wrong. I'm worried that I'll be too anxious to appropriately describe the issue I'm having and just hope that the doctor figures out what's wrong on his own.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office.

0.547600	I worry a lot that I am not being told what I, as an individual need to do. I feel as though there are very standard treatments and more often that not, these are not the best for every single individual.
0.738100	I'm worried about getting bad news. Usually when I'm at the doctor, something is wrong with my health.
0.119000	Honestly, the only thing that bothers me is the long wait. Besides that.... nothing really makes me anxious...I figure the worst that will happen is I find out I have some kind of flesh eating disease.
0.571400	That staff will be rude or mean. That I will have a condition
0.476200	I don't like drawing blood. Last time I went to the doctor they stuck me three times and couldn't get any because I was so tense. They told me to go to a lab and I refuse to, even if I probably should see my lab results. 
0.785700	It's not knowing test results. I want to hear quickly that I don't have serious illnesses. Then I can calm down and deal with what's bothering me.

0.666700	The unknown of what is going on with me. 
0.571400	If I think something is wrong with me. If I haven't been there in a long time.
0.285700	Nothing really, I've not had a bad or surprising experience with a physician. The only thing I would worry about is how long is the visit going to take!
0.476200	I sometimes feel anxious during exams, specifically the well woman exams. I usually just try to breathe and relax, and ask questions when I am unsure of something.
0.571400	That i am going to be sick. That the doctor will be rude
0.761900	I think the thing I'm most worried about is that they will find something wrong with me that I'm not even aware of. Something that could drastically change my life.
0.642900	I am always worried that I am going to find out something that I don't want to hear. For instance, I am worried I could be diagnosed with a major health issue. Also, I fear sometimes that I will be reprimanded for not properly taking care of myself in between visits. 
0.285700	I worry about if my condition has got worse. But I hope I hear they have found a cure.
0.500000	I just don't want to be unhealthy and that makes me anxious. The thought of there being something wrong and how I could afford to take care of myself. 
0.476200	You never know if the reason you're going in is more serious than you thought it was going to be. Plus it can be a stressful situation, especially if you aren't feeling well

0.142900	I think they will try to shove something down my throat.
0.714300	I am most worried about the bill.
0.785700	I get worried they won't be nice. I worry that they might look down on me. I worry that they might try to make me fearful. I've experienced this with some doctors. I've also had ones that don't listen and act annoyed when I ask simple questions. This is what I worry about.
0.428600	I think it's just the fear of the unknown. If I'm not going for any particular reason, you never know what they could find that could be potentially bad. It's just a little scary.
0.714300	I feel most anxious about whether or not I will receive a bad diagnosis.  Often I let my mind wander into the worst of possible situations.  It would be horrifying to me if I received a diagnosis like cancer.
0.452400	I don't always speak up for myself, especially with a new doctor, so it makes me anxious that I may agree to a treatment/medication/etc that I don't actually want to go through with.
0.309500	I usually just get anxious that they'll ask me to do something that makes me uneasy, like having my blood drawn. I have no real reason for it, but I dread having my blood drawn. I'd like for it to stay where it is.
0.690500	I have panic disorder so I'm almost always anxious and worried. But I don't like to think that my doctor will find something termil like cancer.
0.285700	You always hear horror stories about doctors finding serious issues during routine checks. Although the odds are minuscule the thoughts still cross my mind 
0.571400	It is the waiting and wondering if they will take the time or just throw a prescription at me.
0.428600	Visiting the doctor's office, one usually feels apprehensive. The reason for this is that there's always a chance they can find something else wrong than what currently ails an individual.

0.261900	There is always a possibility that you could have something major wrong with you such as cancer or a disease.
0.714300	I'm fat. They always tell you that you need to lose weight or die. 
0.381000	I get worried that there is something seriously wrong with me, potentially lethal.
0.714300	Well sometimes you might have a small problem that you think is bigger. So I try not to panic until I talk to the doctor and find out what's wrong and usually it's nothing really big.
0.214300	The thought of my numbers for my blood tests being bad are what worries me the most.
0.285700	I feel most anxious about getting test results and the impending decision that will need to be made based on those results. It makes me anxious about overthinking the decision or making the wrong choice.
0.309500	getting bad news

0.500000	I am concerned that there is something going wrong with my body

0.309500	That something might actually be wrong makes me feel anxious, but what makes me feel even worse is if I go in with a problem that turns out to be nothing.
0.285700	I'm not usually either of these things. It's the not knowing prior to the doctors that leaves me anxious. Going there I feel relief.
0.142900	If I feel anxious and worried, it must be the test result have some issue and doctor needs to talk to me personnel.
0.714300	I am not in as good as shape as I would like.  I don't like being ked and being fat.
0.714300	Just hearing or getting back the results from tests or seeing what I've read or seen is true.  Guessing that the worst may come true from what the doctor says.
0.357100	If they look at the chart, and then exit the room immediately. This happened when I had interl bleeding from a wrestling accident. I immediately knew it was more serious than I initially thought.
0.976200	I have to go so long between visits to a physician, and my general health and nutrition are so poor that I dread hearing I have a serious illness every time I go. I worry about my wellbeing. I fear that years of poor health and dental care will catch up to me every time I see a physician.
0.166700	Nothing makes me feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I can also relate to what he's saying on a technical level and understand all of the different tests so it is hard to make me feel nervous.
0.928600	I just worry that they will find something that is terribly wrong with me.  I stress that until the exam is complete that I could have some issue that I did not know about.  
0.642900	The general sense of invasion that examition brings, the thought of future discomfort or pain or inconvenience or tragedy, all waiting for me in that little room.
0.214300	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor. Maybe if I had a condition I was sure was serious I might feel kind of anxious.
0.690500	Just the fear that something may actually be wrong and I have no control over. It gives me a great deal of stress.
0.476200	I do not like going to the doctor's in general so when I have to go to a doctor I feel restless and worried sometimes for no reason.
0.142900	Not a lot. It would have to be something quite serious that i'm concerned about for me to be nervous or worried. I don't recall the last time i was worried about an issue i was having to be honest. The only thing i may worry about is the cost of an antibiotic and if it's available in generic form. 
0.261900	The thing that makes me most anxious is just uncertainty.
0.142900	Only times I get nervous is when I am in the waiting room, surrounded by sick people. I really do wish more offices had a split up area where people going in for check ups or non contagious things could be sat away from those with spreadable sicknesses.

0.142900	I do not feel anxious at the Dr. Maybe annoyed because of wait times.
0.381000	The most anxious aspect of visiting the doctor's office is waiting in the lobby to see the doctor. The actual process of talking to a doctor and getting tested isn't a problem for me as I'm a healthy individual.

0.142900	I am worried if they will have to give me a shot that day

0.142900	In the back of my mind i worry that the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me like cancer and that is scary. But this is not at the forefront of my mind and i do not think of it often
0.142900	Well, any time I go there I'm a bit more anxious than usual.  Because it's a doctor's office!  Specifically, probably the sense that he may find something wrong with me that I was not aware of.  And something I do not want to know about.
0.619000	 I feel like they won't believe me when I say I am sick, and I'll have to pass some sort of test in order to get a prescription. I worry my copay money will be wasted if they just tell me to go home and wait it out.
0.857100	The doctor commenting on my weight
0.619000	The thought that something might be terribly wrong with me
0.500000	I am just generally an anxious person. I do not like going to the doctor, especially if I know it will involve a blood draw. I do not do well around blood or needles.

0.142900	I don't get anxious when visiting the doctor

0.904800	I have anxiety in going to the doctor. I feel that the doctor will try and diagnose me with something that I do not have. 
0.452400	What makes me feel most anxious is when i'm sitting in the waiting room forever
0.714300	Being given some negative information about my health that I had no awareness of.
0.285700	The only thing that makes me anxious is the wait time to see her.
0.785700	My main worries are that my lab work would have shown something or that the doctor is dissatisfied with something in my health. My family has many health conditions that I am predisposed to that I also fear about showing eventually in my life.
0.357100	The thing that makes me the most anxious would be going in when I know something is truly wrong with me and not having any idea of the outcome - the uncertainty can be very worrisome. 
0.952400	I fear most that they won't find a solution to the problem I'm having. My pains are real and sometimes they act like I'm faking it.
0.142900	Mostly time constrictions, which really has little to do with my doctor at all. She's pretty great, I must say.
0.428600	Trying to find out why I'm having certain symptoms 
0.690500	Just the not knowing if anything is seriously wrong. Also visits are usually annoying because you have to wait so long and it can be hard when you are sick. 
0.238100	I just always wonder if he will find something wrong that I don't know about. Maybe something has changed in my bloodwork that I need to take care of 
0.333300	Finding out that something is seriously wrong with me.
0.142900	Mostly it's the cost of going to the doctor. I don't normally expect the worst as far as my health is concerned.  
0.261900	its mainly when i don't have a clue whats wrong and could be something serious.
0.142900	Nothing really. My current doctor takes care of me very well.
0.714300	I am always anxious that a problem will be something serious, even though it usually isn't. It is in my ture to prepare for bad news whether it is particularly likely or not.
0.881000	I am afraid of being judged.  I am overweight and I haven't been to a PCP in many yrs.  Both of these things will bring judgment on me.
0.166700	If I'm undergoing a procedure that could have bad results, that makes me anxious. Also, if I have to wait a long time.
0.571400	I always worry that a simple problem is actually something very serious 
0.761900	I usually imagine a worst case scerio, so I am worried about finding out something is seriously wrong with me. I also worry that the Doctor wont take my concerns seriously.
0.571400	I get most anxious when I'm waiting for test results or something. That's when I feel the most anxious, the waiting. I also feel anxious when something painful, like a shot, is about to happen.
0.166700	I would say what worries me the most is that the doctor may find something seriously wrong, like cancer or the like. As I age, I find that I am much more attentive to the possibilities of those types of diseases (cancer, dementia, arthritis, etc).
0.690500	I worry that they might find out I have a medical condition or disease that I will have to deal with. I am also nervous they might say I have not been taking good care of myself, like not exercising enough or not doing enough to watch my cholesterol.
0.142900	I am not anxious at the doctor but if I had to pick something i would say just maybe anxious about shots/pain
0.142900	If I am sick, I will get anxious before seeing doctor worrying about what may be the cause of illness.

0.642900	I would feel the most anxious about finding out bad news.  I would be worried about finding out I have a health problem.
0.904800	I am worried because I'm overweight and self conscious. I'm worried they will give me a hard time about my size. I'm worried they will find something wrong with me. 
0.571400	I don't like being examined and you never know what may come up.  There's always a worry that a doctor will find something wrong.  
0.238100	Strange environment, nervous about having to talk about myself and my issues. Having to bring up questions and concerns when they are doing things. 
0.571400	I'm worried I'll have a condition I didn't think about. I'm worried I won't be able to live.
0.881000	I don't want to have to take my clothes off. Most of the time the basic rule of society is to avoid being ked in front of other people, it's hard to adjust to the idea that it's supposed to be normal to do for medical professiols.
0.833300	I have a general anxiety towards doctors. I feel as though if i go to the doctor i am going to get bad news. No matter what i go for, i feel like they are going to find a termil illness that i did not know i had. 
0.857100	I don't like being touched or judged. 
0.261900	I do not like needles so having to take a blood sample with usually make me a little worried.
0.714300	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor is going to discover a serious medical condition I did not know I had. I am anxious that this will affect my quality of life going forward. This makes me anxious to some degree about visits.
0.761900	Probably the idea that something is very wrong. I am rather overweight, and I know that leads to major problems.
0.238100	I'm occasiolly nervous about what the diagnosis will be or if there will be one. There have been times that I've had to go back a few times before being referred and finding out what is really wrong. 
0.642900	That they will say something that is not what I wanted to hear. Also that they might now really look into what is going on.
0.595200	Sometimes I just get worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I will need surgery or something too costly.
0.547600	I just don't like the sterility and seriousness in the office. It's not because I'm afraid of what's he's going to tell me.
0.714300	My condition is serious and currently I am in remission but every time I have a new scan and go to the doctor there is a chance something could show up so I am anxious
0.428600	Not knowing whats going on or why I feel the way I do (symptoms). Not knowing how long the wait times are.
0.571400	I just worry something bad will be found. That's always a possibility. I dont really like being touched by a stranger either.
0.166700	There is always a small risk present in many interactions. I am afraid that something will go unchecked sometimes.
0.714300	I don't like going to places I'm unfamiliar with. I don't like seeing sick people. Doctors offices usually have a real sad, depressing and anxious environment and feeling. 
0.428600	Just the anxiety of waiting to hear if anything is seriously wrong. I get worried when I have to wait, but I'm usually reassured in the end.
0.142900	The only time I would feel anxious is if I think something is really seriously wrong and then I would worry about the outcome.
0.857100	He always tries to prescribe pills to me I don't want to take. An example is my blood pressure is normal, and yet he stills tries for me to get high blood pressure pills.
0.690500	That the doctor will find something wrong with my health.
0.357100	How long it takes. The test that I have to take.
0.785700	I feel anxious because I know my problems will be over looked or shoved off as not important. It makes me unhappy to be wasting my time. 
0.738100	When they are scowling and in a bitter mood. It's not my fault but they still end up taking out their anger on me. It greatly pisses me off. So i go home think whether or not they truly told me what I needed to hear
0.690500	I am most anxious that the doctor will tell me that something is wrong. I know that if something is wrong, I will have to do/take something that is very inconvenient or expensive.
0.285700	I am sometimes worried that I'm not going to pass one of the tests and will have some sort of condition. Before going in, I feel like I don't know how healthy I am. 
0.785700	I usually assume the worst, when I have a doctors visit. Most of the time I was right. 
0.523800	The results of tests and what might be wrong with my body.
0.761900	I worry that they are going to tell me something is wrong, that I am sick or dying. Just a general fear of receiving bad news.
0.761900	not knowing what they will find, or even if they will listen to what is going on with me
0.309500	I feel little uncomfortable to describe some pain about mine body.
0.214300	I am most worried that the doctor will find something wrong.
0.404800	I don't honestly feel anxious when visiting the doctor. I am there to get help. I can imagine if I had a severe health problem that my anxiety level would be much higher but so far I have not had that experience.
0.404800	If I think something is actually wrong with me. I'll be a bit nervous until I get the results. Usually I try to keep calm.
0.404800	
0.666700	I am a very paranoid person when it comes to my health. Health is one of the most important things in this world so I am always concerned about losing my health. Even though I live a relatively healthy lifestyle and am young I still worry more than I should. 
0.142900	Not knowing how something is going to turn out. Whether a test is going to give not so great results or something else like that.
0.214300	I'm always worried that my doctor will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer
0.738100	Just sitting there wondering what they will find or if my condition is changing for the worse.
0.333300	I have always been anxious at the doctor's office, from when I was an infant.  Nowadays, it's not so bad, but mainly the sterility of the room, and the hyper-awareness of my body, plus being poked or prodded at, makes me nervous.
0.809500	I worry the doctor will find something I did not expect. I also worry that if something is wrong, it will be expensive to treat. I tend to fear for the worst.
0.381000	Bad surprises.  Not getting satisfactory answers and/or individual attention
0.238100	I know that my physician will want to spend less than 5 minutes with my care and that annoys me. I feel anxious in order to get my most immediate needs out as quickly as possible knowing that he will soon sprint for the door. I do not feel that I am receiving adequate care with him and am looking to change physicians.
0.190500	Just that something might be wrong but only slightly have the feeling
0.404800	That I will be forced into a new medication that my body won't tolerate. 
0.285700	I am not typically anxious about visiting the doctor's office.
0.404800	Unexpected changes in weight, blood pressure, etc. (i.e. the unknown.)
0.500000	I do not like getting blood drawn, and I get scared to hear bad news.
0.619000	worried something might be wrong. 
0.785700	I am an anxious person to begin with, so waiting in a public area with other people is already nerve wracking on it's own. I also have trouble talking with people I know well about my problems, so the idea of divulging intimate physical problems makes me very nervous.
0.619000	Of course I am concerned there may be some serious issue that I didn't know about. Everyone is a bit paranoid about their health and little pains or symptoms that they experience.
0.381000	I am mostly worried about the worst outcome. If I have a problem that I do not know what is going on, I am worried that the diagnosis will be poor and that could affect my lifespan or quality of life in general. I am also anxious when they lecture me about my health habits because I don't need a lecture as an adult, I understand my choices.
0.214300	I think most anxiety/worries just come from not knowing what is going to happen
0.142900	possibly finding out some bad news
0.476200	I only feel anxious when I feel I have a problem that may require further visits. I have little or no anxiety with check ups or other tests. The only other times when I am anxious is when I have a problem so bad that it interferes with my life.
0.333300	Just the thought that some illness may be discovered that I have.
0.285700	I don't want to be diagnosed with a serious condition, I'm not anxious about seeing the doctor but the possibility that something is seriously wrong with my health
0.738100	I don't like the feeling of being exposed to strangers. I don't want to find out information that might make me change something drastic in my life.
0.666700	Just that he might find something terribly wrong, or he missed something on a previous exam. Or something small that I don't think about turns out to be very important. Like a small pain or something that I don't think about turns out to be a symptom of something worse.
0.476200	The lighting in most of the doctor's offices seem to mess with my anxiety. I don't care to sit in those rooms waiting on the doctor. Depending what I am going for I may get nervous of the results. 
0.523800	Worrying about blood results coming back
0.595200	I'm always concerned that there might be some hidden condition that I am uware of that the doctor will find on a visit. I also dislike any sort of pain or discomfort during an examition. The worst part for me is waiting alone in the exam room before he comes in - my imagition is working overtime at that point.
0.285700	I don't get too anxious but i would probably have to say when they check my blood pressure.
0.904800	finding something wrong with me.changing my meds
0.523800	I feel worried and anxious that the doctor won't listen to my concerns and will dismiss me.  Instead of providing me with a solution, they just tell me there is nothing they can do to help me.
0.142900	The only thing that  has ever worried me is having symptoms that doesn't have a clear diagnosis. At that point, the doctor has to guess just like I would. 
0.738100	Pain.  But also, I know that I need to lose a few pounds.  I exercise regularly and am not dropping any weight.  I know I'm going to be scolded for it.
0.142900	Because I have dealt with cancer in the past, this would be my most main concern when going for check-ups - that they would feel something suspicious.
0.642900	I hate having to talk to people about myself, and I feel like if I say something's been bothering me they'll treat me as if I don't know my own body and as if everything's my fault. I feel like they look down on me when I'm not in 100% top condition.
1.000000	i HATE going to the doctor and hospitals. i was in and out of them nonstop as a kid with very serious health problems.
0.285700	that I might get some disease or virus from the patients in the waiting room or from surfaces in the doctor's office. He also always shakes my hand. 
0.857100	I'm worried they won't listen to me. I'm worried I will encounter yet another doctor who does not care at all. I feel mistrustful after previous experiences.
0.761900	They're fairly sterile and I generally feel concerned about what possible medical problems I could have.
0.428600	Trying to explain accurately what's going on and hoping I don't need further tests. Uncertainty 
0.309500	That he might find something wrong.
0.666700	You never know when they are going to find something that is going to be a problem.  Even when you feel healthy, an exam always makes me anxious.
0.428600	The thing that makes me the most worried is wondering if my doctor will diagnose me with some sort of rare sickness that will cost a lot of money or if he will have to check my testicles for cancer. 
0.190500	Just the waiting in the office to be seen and hearing everyone else cough and sneeze makes me anxious
0.571400	I'm occasiolly worried about what I will be diagnosed with.
0.571400	I guess it's because I really don't like doctors. They are not always honest to you.
0.595200	Only that they might find something I'm not aware of. I am almost 60 so anything could go wrong. 
0.190500	What makes me more anxious while visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what they will say about anything.
1.000000	In my dad's side of the family (possibly mom's too), we all have fear of doctors. I worry that the doctor will find something really wrong with me that nobody can fix. I'd rather live my life happily not knowing instead of dreading what I could possibly have.
0.142900	What makes me feel most anxious is just the interaction with the doctor.  I respect his opinion.
0.309500	I am most worried the doctor may come across a condition I was uware of, and that requires lots of treatment
0.452400	The bill, for one. I can self diagnose online for free. We only go to the doctor to get pills for a condition we didn't know we had. I would rather die a horrible cancerous death than bother going on chemo or any BS like that. There are numerous altertive medicines out there that can literally cure this, but since big pharma says no, doctors won't acknowledge it. That's where the mistrust and anxiety comes in.
0.619000	I am worried something serious will be wrong with my health.
0.285700	Having little time with him because he stays busy all day, so I worry I may not get the time I need to talk about what is happening with me. 
0.142900	I don't want to hear any bad news about my health.
0.833300	I am worried that they will find out I have some horrible disease, or they will give me a medication that causes bad side effects.  I also worry about how much my medical treatments will cost.
0.761900	I think it's just fear of the unknown. I wonder whether I've developed some type of illness since my last visit, and let that fear take me to some dark places.
0.142900	I worry that they'll find something very wrong with me. Such as cancer or something
0.142900	I don't. I'm always calm when i visit my Dr
0.523800	The fear that soemthing worse might be wrong with me then initially thought. That uncertainty can make me very uncomfortable.
0.666700	I feel like they don't really care that much and don't even try to pretend to.  They are quick to prescribe pills before any other options.
0.690500	I'm mostly worried about not asking the right questions while I am there. I'm not usually sure what I need to be asking. I then worry about whether  I'll be able to understand all the information that is going to be thrown at me. I'm just hoping it sticks so I can move on with my life as comfortably as possible. 
0.690500	The thing that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility that I could have a health problem. This makes me anxious because even when you live a healthy lifestyle, you can randomly get health problems. So it is this dread of the unknown that makes me anxious when visiting the doctor's office. 
0.571400	to hear some bad news about my health
0.571400	Mostly when I feel worried or anxious it's because I'm paranoid that something is wrong with me and I'm about to find out some terrible news.
1.000000	I have been sick most of my life. My anxiety is spiked when I have to deal with a new nurse, or sometimes the regular Dr is not in when I go to my appt, I prefer just my primary care provider. I do not trust the others very much.
0.547600	I've always been afraid of needles and visiting the doctor, but I have become better about this as I get older. Sometimes I worry that she will find something wrong that will require daily medication or some other more aggressive treatment.
0.690500	I fear physical aging of the body such as joint pain and also breast cancer, which my mother passed from.
0.381000	I am always concerned the doctor is going to find something seriously wrong with me, something i have not noticed. Like a tumor or cancer or some type of STD. 
0.142900	Nothing.
0.642900	I have longstanding health problems and I'm always worried they are going to say there are signs that they are getting worse. This makes me anxious and worried.
0.738100	i had having female check ups those seem so invasive
0.214300	That I'm going to have an underlying problem that is going to be a long-term health ailment. My biggest fear is that I go in for one problem, but my Dr. discovers something more horrendous. 
0.142900	Usually it's just a routine check up, so I never really am too worried. I would guess that the only worry I would have is if something came back unusual from my regular check up, but then again, that would just mean it was caught before I even noticed anything wrong, which would be better than being caught too late.
0.690500	I always am worried about what is going on with me or if she will find something out that I don't know about.  I feel horribel getting on the scale and am embarrassed 
0.142900	What makes the most anxious is when they're running extremely late and I have to sit there and wait.  It gets me upset that they don't care that I've had to take time out of my day and they should be courteous to others as we are to them.
0.714300	I am more worried about being taken seriously for pain and symptoms I am having even though I have rarely had experiences where they were dismissed. I am also usually worried about the outcome or source of discomfort or symptoms. 
0.404800	The fear that you have something worse than what you really have.
0.357100	I usually feel anxious when waiting for the results of tests
0.142900	The only thing that makes me really anxious would be getting shots or have blood taken.   I am in relatively good health so I don't usually have health problems so I am not usually worried when I see a doctor 
0.309500	The ever-present possibility of long wait times. 
0.381000	The one thing that makes me feel even slightly anxious is the idea that I somehow may have contracted some sort of disease that I would have not noticed without going to the doctor.
0.238100	I do not get anxious around doctors.
0.523800	I just don't like going. It's a fear of the unkown, and not wanting there to be anything bad wrong.
0.619000	My family has a lot of health problems. While I have been relatively healthy for my whole life so far, things could change at any time. I get nervous that I won't have my health in a future situation, so I try to do everything I can to stay healthy so I can live an active life. 
0.285700	I would say that I feel most anxious when the doctor's facial expression says something before they even tell me.  if the doctor looks discouraged about test results I usually become anxious or worried.
0.642900	After having some tests done, I'm always fearful while waiting for the results.  She will usually tell me what to expect, but I worry about everything. 
0.428600	I get worried when I go to doctors when they give me results of blood work or tests.
0.738100	I am worried that my doctor will tell me I have a disease or that I am overweight. Or he'll tell me that I need to start eating better.
0.666700	I am worried that the diagnosis would be something completely different from what I expected it to be. I am worried that something may be more serious than it seems. 
0.785700	I hate needles I hate the blood pressure machine my health is reasobly good it's just I don't like being poked and prodded
0.738100	I never know what could be wrong with me.  I'm most worried about not knowing what the procedure might entail, if anything will hurt, and if a new condition will be discovered.
0.166700	The wait time.
0.452400	I just don't enjoy being poked and prodded by other people. I also have received some unfortute medical diagnoses (melanoma twice) in the last year, so it makes me a little worried that it will come back. 
0.595200	When I visit the doctors office it is usually for a reason, and I am worried that it will be a larger health concern than I would like to have. For example, I worry that the bump on my ear must be removed by surgery and thinking about hearing that makes me anxious. 
0.309500	That they will find something unexpected that is detrimental to my health.
0.714300	Not knowing what the outcome will be. I'm not a hypochondriac per se, but I do tend to think the worst thing whenever something is wrong with me physically. I dread getting a bad diagnosis but usually it's not that bad and can be easily fixed.
0.428600	Without a doubt, giving blood or receive a vaccition such as a flu shot. I really don't like needles:)
0.381000	What makes me most anxious is just being around people, and having the environment be chaotic and loud. 
0.500000	Well if he insist on taking another test
0.523800	I always worry before a doctor's appointment. I always worry that I'll get bad news. 
1.000000	"I basically have ""white coat"" syndrome. Everything about a doctors office scares me. It just makes me feel like I am in danger even though nothing is wrong."
0.285700	The expentancy of news, the fear of having a desease or having something wrong with me without a cure. 
0.333300	The unknown or possible conditions that could be found. 
0.404800	What makes me feel anxious is whether I am going to get new information or not.
0.619000	the uncertainty of whats wrong with me, and if they can fix it and HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
0.690500	I always worry about hearing bad news. 
0.476200	Just not knowing what is going to happen.  I always have a hard time when I don't know what to expect.
0.690500	If he's going to find something wrong with me
0.523800	I worry about not making the appointment on time. I have to take the bus and make at least one transfer so there is a question of missing the appointment.
0.142900	I am always calm in the Dr's office.  I don't worry until there is something to worry about.
0.595200	I feel worried that something is going to turn out more negative than I expect. That the doctor will find something wrong that I wasn't expecting or give me bad news.
0.309500	Not much, usually. If I have to discuss an embarrassing issue I could be nervous, maybe. 
0.690500	Will I need any bloodwork done? Will I have to fight them to convince them to change my birth control or acknowledge my bi-annual sinus infections that I've gotten like clockwork since I was 16? 
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious or worried when I go visit a doctor. 
0.452400	I am worried that I won't be able to get my prescription any more.
0.285700	Potential health issues.
0.690500	I just feel like the doctor might not take my opionions seriously and maybe rude to me. I also fear there maybe something seriously wrong.
0.666700	I'm nervous to begin with and do not like going to doctors to begin with and then you add the added anxiety of them finding something wrong, so yes I do feel anxiety going to the doctor for a couple reasons.
0.190500	I have a history of medical problems. Every time I go to the doctors I pray nothing else will be wrong. Along with my current issues are stable/improving. 
0.261900	If I have an ailment, I'm most worried about how much time and cost I will have to dedicate to having it treated.
0.571400	I get worried that something may be wrong and I don't know it.
0.714300	A doctor, whether they like it or not, has a certain amount of power over their patients, and I have a lot of trouble dealing with situations where people have power over me (and I have been justified in that concern). It's stressful having to be in situations of uncertainty or where I don't have the control I want.
0.142900	When I have something wrong and the doctor takes a long time to figure out what it is. Though I suppose the worst is worrying about the cost of the procedure.
0.547600	Misdiagnose me or just scam me into spending more.
0.142900	The only thing I ever feel anxious or worried about is (1) waiting too long for the doctor to appear and (2) worry about whether I going to get a nurse who will do a painless job with the needle!
0.738100	You never know what they are going to find.  Even if you feel totally healthy they could tell you something is wrong.  That is what makes me feel anxious.
0.666700	The fear that something might be wrong.
0.904800	It's just uncomfortable having your body examined by a stranger. Waiting in the room, sometimes half ked, is really not my idea of fun. I am afraid of being judged by the doctor or afraid of finding out some sort of bad news about my health.
0.285700	The only problem I have is finding a doctor who will do a thorough examition and LISTEN to what I'm saying.  I don't mind one that experiments as long as I know it is and that we are working together.
0.476200	It depends on the situation. If I am seeing my doctor, say, because I am not feeling well or in a lot of pain, then of course I'll feel anxious and worried that something might be seriously wrong. If it's just routine checkups, then I'm relaxed.
0.881000	I am incredibly anxious to begin with and I'm not a huge fan of going to the doctors. I hate the unknown, but I hate bad news even more. I also get scared of being judged by the doctors and nurses. 
0.261900	Hoping the report will turn out fine as usual
0.571400	He telling me that something is wrong with my results.
0.500000	I worry that I am going to receive news that I have a physical illness that went undetected before. I'm worried that I might have cancer, diabetes, or heart issues. I am obese, so my weight is of great concern. 
0.523800	I am usually worried that my blood pressure will be high. The anxiety ends up making my blood pressure high. It is sort of a cycle. 
0.309500	Just the possibility of things that could go wrong. Things could always go awry. The doctor could always find something that you did not know you had going on.
0.142900	I feel anxious that the doctor will be in a rush and I will not be able to ask questions I have.
0.142900	I get a little anxious if I have to wait awhile for my physician. Sometimes I'm worried if something new is bothering me and finding out what it is. 
0.547600	The fact of what could be wrong makes me anxious.  I don't know if I have an issue that will require further medical attention.
0.381000	It's not a remark on my confidence in my doctor; it's more of the fact that I'm worried that I have some underlying condition that is more serious than I anticipated.
0.714300	I think I worry the most about what could be wrong. Even though I'm in excellent health, I have somewhat of a fear that something could be wrong with me when I go in.
0.476200	Nothing specific.  I do not take great care of myself and have a rough family medical history.
0.785700	I get anxious going to the doctor because I don't know what they will say or have me do, and I don't know if I will be able to explain my problem well enough for them to understand.
0.547600	i just do not like being touched by people i am not close with. i also hate waiting to see if something is wrong with me
0.666700	I'm always afraid that he will find something knowing that I'm not a spring chicken.
0.666700	worry that something is wrong
0.142900	I never feel anxious when I visit the doctor. The few times in my life when I did it was only because I thought the illness I was experiencing might be indicative of something very serious. I was worried about the diagnosis but not the doctor.
0.476200	When I am there for symptoms. Also the anxious feeling is there because no one taught me how to go to doctors and make appointments for myself.
0.666700	When visiting the doctor , I sometimes feel anxious because of the unknown. You never know what a doctor is going to tell you. If something is wrong , I always have the feeling it will be something horrible...
0.785700	I always fear a negative diagnosis such as a termil disease or serious debilitating condition.  Some of the tests are not fun either.  Such as blood tests.  
0.690500	The not knowing why they do what they are doing when they are doing it. I have yet to find a doctor that will answer my ongoing questions as to WHY things are done and What the purpose of those are, in a complete way. Sometimes the answers that I get just make me have more questions.
0.714300	"The physical vulnerability makes me antsy - I'm a very physically private person, so the examition itself usually makes me uneasy. And then of course there's the ""what if"" thoughts of what could be the worst-case scerio."
0.500000	I am always worried they will find something serious like they did with my mother's cancer.
0.595200	I worry about what the doctor might find. I feel much more at ease once it is over and I am given a clean bill of health. Until then, I get nervous about anything that might be going in my body that I didn't know about. 
0.285700	"I am most worried about the ""fear of the unknown"".  In other words, will the doctor discover something that I am not aware of.   I am not worried about taking any shots or vaccines - but more worried on what I don't know at this point about my health."
0.571400	Nothing makes me so. I believe in God's providence in everything including my own health.
0.381000	I get nervous when it gets really persol such as at the OBGYN and I also hate getting shots or blood work done.
0.238100	Not knowing what to expect from the appointment, or test results.  
0.714300	I just hate being examined and having to visit the doctor in general. Life would be easier without having yearly exams to have to go to. :)
0.857100	Feel worried my health will be judged. There's also the looming fear that my health is worse than I imagined. 
0.333300	I am a general worrier anyway. Going to the doctor for a general check-up does not worry me. But If I am having any kind of strange symptom I may being to woryy or become anxious over what could be the problem.
0.690500	I feel anxious looking at the different types of instruments.
0.547600	I always get a little nervous when I go to the doctor so my blood pressure raises. That makes me more anxious that I'll have an extremely high blood pressure when they take it. Something about being at a doctors office is slightly off putting.
0.571400	The thought that something completely insane might be discover like cancer
0.428600	I usually feel most anxious when I am waiting, waiting to be brought back to the exam and waiting to see the doctor. I also get anxious when I feel sick and don't know what's wrong with me, the unknown makes me worried.
0.619000	I am worried that something will be wrong with me. That, or I worry that the doctor may judge me. I'm worried he might think I'm lazy, gross, or don't take catre of myself.
0.619000	I'm always worried that he may find something terribly wrong with me. I'm always worried about cancer.
0.642900	The wait, I'm sitting there just thinking about different things to worry about.
0.476200	My health might have problems makes me worried. My health also might be worse than last time.
0.690500	I just don't like the idea of being examined or judged for my bad decisions in life. 
0.666700	I think for me there is always the fear of what will they find that I don't know about, the what if something is really wrong fear. Other than that the exam, albeit uncomfortable at times is not really an issue. 
0.761900	I'm always afraid that something serious will come up that I was uware of.
0.476200	Because I have some current and past health issues, I am often anxious about whether these health issues may be negatively effecting my health in a serious way. I am also nervous that my doctor may ask me questions that I am nervous to answer because I feel I might've done something to negatively effect my health.
0.238100	They might find something seriously wrong.
0.761900	I dealt with some health issues in the past. So it makes me anxious when I am visiting a doctor for a problem I think I may have. Mostly I am anxious that they will tell me I do in fact have this problem but I am also hopeful that I will not have health issues
0.214300	nothing really
0.666700	If the doctor seems preoccupied or spends little time with me and leaves my care in the hands of his nurse, that concerns me.  When his staff makes a mistake, that worries me.

0.619000	I feel anxious when the doctor makes me uncomfortable or talks down to me. Additiolly, if the nurses or front desk staff are rude when I walk in, I start to feel uneasy.
0.857100	Pap smears make me very uncomfortable. I do not like getting ked in front of my doctor. I often leave the hospital feeling violated.
0.142900	"I'm not anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, at all. There isn't a need to be. It's not as if I ""must"" by some law follow what they ask me to do, it's merely a choice. I'd be far more worried to visit a dentist and worry about needing a cavity filled then seeing a doctor. "
0.523800	The doctor may find something wrong that I didn't expect. I feel like I am in good health and don't like to find out there is something wrong that I didn't know about.
0.595200	I have a lot of social anxiety, so just going there and talking to a doctor makes me anxious, just from the social aspect of interacting with them. It also makes me anxious to talk about issues I'm having, especially if they are embarrassing. I also don't like mentioning things related to lifestyle choices that may reflect badly upon me, and it makes me anxious when things like that come up.
0.476200	I'm at the age where 29 years of firefighting are catching up with me. This is wehre the weird cancers, heart problems, etc start coming in . I will probably have to take early retirement due to my TBI, so I am dreading that
0.547600	Worried that it could be something serious, or even termil.
0.476200	I usually don't feel anxious at the doctor. But sometimes I feel anxious at the doctor with my kids, I just want them to be healthy and I get nervous if something is wrong.
0.523800	Not knowing what results the doctor will find.
0.714300	I feel anxious because even though I know there is most likely a problem I hate to hear that I have a problem. It's an anxiety that I have always had before visiting a doctor or dentist.
0.214300	I'm usually just worried that something is going to be seriously wrong with me. Or that the doctor will miss something important.
0.619000	I hate shots, giving blood, etc., and will do anything I can to avoid them.  I wish there was a way for the doctor to put me more at ease.  I don't think it's her responsibility to do this, but I have had experiences where I felt much more at ease depending on the person when I've had to give blood.  
0.190500	That he may find something wrong. Even though it would perhaps be able to get better, sometimes ignorance is bliss.
0.714300	The possibility of finding out something is wrong can lead me to feel anxious or worried. The more regular my visits are the less worry this causes me.  
0.428600	I don't know, I don't like to get ked or just put on that paper gown. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Also, I get worried about how much it's going to cost, because even though I have insurance, the copay can still be really high.
0.690500	I always get nervous about having blood drawn.  Even though it's not that painful, I still dread the puncture.
0.238100	I think it is just an overall feeling I get from seeing a doctor.  I have never been good at doctors offices or hospitals, they just give me an overall nervous feeling that I can't really explain.
0.142900	I don't generally go to the doctor's office very much except for a routine check up. It doesn't make me feel very anxious or worried because I am fairly healthy and active for a woman of my age, and I don't see why anything would go wrong or if anything negative would happen when I am having nothing going on.
0.952400	"They're going to want to order more tests ""just to be sure"" so that our understanding goes from 90% likely to 92% likely, but these new tests are going to cost me enough to take years to pay off."
0.214300	If I'm going in for something unknown, I might feel a bit anxious.  Other than that, it's routine body maintence.
0.690500	Something might come up. Maybe it will be caught early, or maybe something terrible will be detected like cancer.
0.428600	I really don't suffer from anxiety at all when visiting the doctor. Potentially missing work is the only thing that worries me.
0.785700	If I am going in about a problem I am worried about what he tells me is wrong with me. I am worried that it will be something serious that would require more medical attention from a professiol.
0.142900	The most worried I get is being concerned about having to wait to long to be seen.  Other than that, there isn't much to be worried or anxious about.  Whatever I am there for, the doctor will do his best.
0.833300	I've had doctors insult me, accuse me of lying, or jump to false conclusions. I don't feel safe in a doctor's office.
0.261900	Its the waiting in a crowded room.
0.690500	I get anxious wondering if I will have health problems.
0.142900	nothing, I feel fine when I go. 
0.738100	I feel anxious because i sometimes think i will be diagnosed with a terrible disease.
0.881000	I am worried about having to get ked. I am worried about finding out something is wrong with me. I am nervous about having to talk to a stranger about persol issues.
0.571400	I am working hard to improve my health and I always get worried that my tests will show that I have regressed in my work.  I also worry that at some point it may come back and tell me that I have developed a serious health issue that will require lifestyle changes.
0.738100	The man barely looks me in the eye. He's very brusque. 
0.571400	Doctors usually are hurried and that makes me anxious. I usually have questions and I'm worried that I won't have time to ask them. Or I worry about whether the doctor will listen to me and help me. I have been dismissed so often by doctors, especially for my children. 
0.738100	Being examined and evaluated more than anything. Insecurity, if I had to put it another way.
0.595200	Them finding something wrong with me that isn't easy to fix.
0.142900	Getting sick from other patients. 
0.500000	Needles primarily, but once it happens it isn't htat bad. It's the anticipation that bothers me.
0.619000	What they may find or tell me what is wrong.
0.142900	I don't usually feel anxious or worried about going to my doctor. If there are problems, then I will deal with them when they arise. Only time I'm a bit apprehensive is if I need to see a new doctor.
0.238100	Just know I don't go enough and dont stay on top of my health and past health issues so when I go I am slightly worried about things I neglected to keep checking on being worse 
0.690500	Being judged. Having to get kid. 
0.142900	That I'll have a super long wait. I really don't get nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.166700	It does make me worried if I have some sort of condition that feels unresolved or it could worsen. I know it is good to figure out what is going on, but it worries me to imagine what it could be.
0.690500	not being able to properly explain my condition and not receiving adequate treatment
0.952400	I am afraid I might be told something I don't want to hear, such as cancer.
0.452400	I can feel anxious about my doctor finding something wrong with me.
0.595200	Honestly, just the thought of having to go into the office and waiting. I have gotten to the point in my life now where I freely discuss health issues and concerns. 
0.642900	I am most worried about the doctor telling me that something is wrong (like finding a lump) and that farther testing will be required. Some things cant be found or will go unnoticed until you visit a doctor, and I am most scared about some illness creeping up on me.
0.214300	I, like most people, have a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. This stems purely from not knowing if something is wrong with me that I might not have noticed. I stay in shape, and have a healthy routine, but there is always the chance that something is lurking underneath. 
0.119000	I honestly have no anxiety when meeting with my doctor. I enjoy the process. 
0.547600	Am I going to have the issue addressed or will I have it out aside again.
0.285700	I guess it's all the waiting. There is always at least a 10-15 minute wait in the office before the appointment. 5-10 would be more acceptable. Then there is also the time you have to wait in the examition room. 
0.238100	"I'm turning 40 this year, so I do get a little anxious these days when I go to the doctor. There's always a little ""what if he finds something"" voice in the back of my head, even though I'm quite healthy overall. I don't really mind going all that much, though."
0.666700	Probably that they will find something horrible. They are going to tell me i'm to fat and to quit smoking. Both are easy to say but hard to do.
0.642900	Even if I feel healthy, I get worried that there is something wrong. Also, I don't visit the doctor often so I get anxious about being in an unfamiliar place. Since it is so far between times I visit a doctor I get worried that I waited too long for them to diagnose.
0.190500	I'm worried that I may have a hidden condition of some sort. I generally feel healthy, but there is also a small thought in the back of my head that I may have hidden, lingering cancer or something. I don't want to get bad news. 
0.690500	Finding out that I might have a chronic disease.
0.690500	The fear in the back of my head that they will find something drastically wrong.  I am worried I will get bad news. 
0.190500	Not much really. It is a process I understand that has to take place and sometimes it is tedious and takes time to complete.  Too many blood draws on occasion 
0.357100	It's not so much the doctor visit that concerns me.  It's the lab results.  As I am under aggressive treatments for my Cancer, my lab numbers fluctuate with various modalities and medications and that gives me modest concern.
0.404800	It's a little irratiol, but sometimes when I'm in the waiting room, I worry about that the doctor might find something terribly wrong. I know there's nothing really wrong because I feel fine, but in the back of my mind, I still think something might crop up that will be a terrible burden to treat. 
0.738100	I hate shots. I hate shots a LOT. I'm always in fear that my affliction will result in a blood test or a shot of some sort and that's when I get REALLY tense.
0.666700	I often worry that results from an exam or test will point to a disease or condition such as cancer. When I wait to hear back via email from a doctor regarding test results, it is often a tense and worrisome time. 
0.452400	I mostly just get worried that I will have some unforeseen symptom that they notice that could mean something bad. I also get worried I will need a shot that day.
0.142900	nothing i know my body and the health care system as well as my doctor so there is nothing to be anxious about
0.619000	"I guess there is always the possibility of seeing a doctor for a simple check-up and having them start a sentence with, ""Oh my god, why didn't you have this mole looked at sooner....you have a week to live."" I don't really think that way until I am half-dressed and being examined.  So I would say there is a moment of feeling vulnerable in that situation, but I don't obsess or anything."
0.476200	Typically I am just worried something will come up during the exam. My doctor is capable of making me feel better. The diagnosis of things is typically explained properly as well with little questions from me.
0.285700	Maybe having bad results.
0.809500	I don't want to hear any bad news.  I just want to hear that all is well and I can go about my life.  I do not want to hear that something is worrisome and I need more tests, etc.
0.881000	How much my insurance will cover.  If the doctor will tell me something I don't want to know.  If they are going to treat me with respect and give me the time that I need.
0.571400	Fear that I may need to spend more money. Whether it's a follow up, a medication, or even just a test.
0.285700	Nothing about going to the doctor makes me feel this way.  Usually I feel annoyed because of the kids, the waiting, and the cost.
0.666700	That they will push needless meds and tests and not do anything for me anyway. Doctor is no longer a noble profession
0.714300	If I have a health problem I usually get anxious over whether the doctor will be able to help me or not. I get worried about what tests or procedures might be necessary and whether any serious diseases might be discovered.
0.714300	Health problems for me tend to get found when things go wrong. I have had serious health problems. Ever examition feels like it could lead to a new treatment, a new bill, a new health concern. 
0.214300	that he might find something wrong with me that i was uware of or that is bad.
0.738100	I am always afraid even if i  am doing  everything right that I'm going in and they are going to tell me bad news. I have what they call white coat syndrome and it makes me feel bad. 
0.642900	I think the feeling of finding something seriously wrong. I've been lucky to not have very many medical problems in life so I only have to go to the doctor for something minor. It's not a familiar place so that makes for some anxious feelings overall. 
0.833300	When I visit a doctor's office I am always anxious because I don't know what he is going to find. I am always worried about my physical health.
0.523800	I think it's just the fact that I could get really bad news at the doctor. 
0.690500	I always worry that the doctor I'm seeing won't be attentive to my needs. I have encountered several doctors that seem to have a script that they recite, no matter what ailment I'm being seen for. I worry that the visit will not accomplish anything, and it makes me feel quite helpless.
0.595200	I am afraid of the procedures that cause pain.Also finding something is wrong with me is scary.
0.238100	What makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility of receiving really bad news whether it pertains to me or my children. This holds especially true every time my daughter has a checkup or when my wife and I had our hearts looked at to ensure we didn't have any issues go unnoticed for the majority of our lives.
0.428600	I tend to feel anxious whenever there strangers involved, especially professiols. I tend to be anxious all the time, especially when outside of places I'm comfortable with or familiar with, and a doctor's office is the furthest thing from a comfortable space to be in. That, and I'm always paranoid that I might unintentiolly make it more difficult for the doctor to actually do their job. I tend to breathe very differently, almost as if I'm trying to keep myself from showing any potential symptoms. Plus, my self-destructive tendencies (that are caused by my depression) tend to come in the form of me denying myself help, so even I mage to get to a doctor, I feel cornered. 
0.976200	Just nervous being at the doctor's office, I have anxiety every time even when it's just a simple check-up. Mainly the uncertainty.
0.166700	The thing that I experience the most anxiety from is the fact that there are other people at the office. I always have anxiety when being in the same room as multiple people. However, one on ones with the doctor or nurse doesn't bother me at all.
0.642900	Recieving bad news. Getting a wrong diagnosis.
0.381000	I think there's always that worry in the back of your head that there may be something really wrong with you and the doctor is about to find it and tell you.
0.809500	Normally I am concerned, like most, that my doctor could find something seriously wrong with me. My mother passed of lupus, and my father just recovered from colon cancer, so I am concerned that it's only a matter of time that I am diagnosed with a life threatening aliment. 
0.523800	i would say a fear of getting bad news. a fear of being judged. i don't like to be touched also so that makes me anxious.
0.738100	I don't like doctors in general. I always worry they will find something that I don't know about. I have a great doctor, but it is just a scary process. The physical evaluation is also worrysome. I don't like people poking around my body. 
0.357100	I'm usually worried they won't believe me about whatever problem I'm having. I've had this happen multiple times, and both issues turned out being detectable, serious ones even though the first doctor didn't believe me.
0.523800	If I truly think something is wrong with me, then I am most anxious when she is  giving the physical examition.\
0.714300	I almost always feel skeptical that I will get any good answers and it makes me feel worried that I will never find an answer.
0.523800	I am worried that there will be something that will be expensive. Unfortutely we are in a position where we don't have great insurance coverage and we don't have a lot of savings so a medical issue could be very costly to us. 
0.714300	I lost trust , because i want doctors to tell the truth if they are not aware of some type of medical problem before, rather than using someone as a guinea pig for their experiment.
0.666700	I am most anxious and worried when visiting a doctor because I am fearful that they might find something seriously wrong with me. I am not a hypochondriac but I usually only see a doctor when something is bothering me.
0.142900	Probably just the blood tests I have to take.  They changed people and the new people aren't very good at making it quick and painless.
0.285700	I don't normally feel anxious for myself, but i do get nervous for my child and unborn baby. I worry that a simple cold is actually cancer or that the baby will have some rare disease. With myself, I worry that I will have cancer and won't be able to raise my kids. The actual doctor doesn't make me nervous at all. 
0.595200	I always fear the worst. I think I'm going to end up getting something really bad and those thoughts run through my mind while im in the office.
0.214300	I feel anxious that something might be wrong with me. I worry that I might get diagnosed with something bad.
1.000000	They want to make a healthy person sick by prescribing unnecessary tests and procedures to charge a huge bill, also lacking skills and giving incorrect diagnosis.
0.452400	I feel most anxious before the uncertainty of answers. I understand trained medical professiols are not supposed to let on emotiolly about the prognosis/diagnosis of a patient. Still, I rely on the small nuances in their expression or tone, body language, etc. to gauge the real severity of the situation.
0.952400	When I visit the doctor, I'm afraid that I am going to be very sick. This feeling comes even if I've had no symptoms or other serious illness
0.833300	I am most worried that my doctor will notice that my health has been going downhill since the last time I saw them. I am also uneasy about the physical examition that involves my doctor physically touching me under the hospital gown.
0.666700	That they'll find something seriously wrong with me. I'm always afraid I will have some termil illness.
0.714300	I ALWAYS KNOW THE ISSUE ABOUT MY WEIGHT IS GOING TO COME UP.  I HATE TALKING ABOUT IT.  I HAVE TRIED AND FAILED MANY TIMES TO LOSE WEIGHT.  I ALSO NOTICE MORE PAINS THAN USUAL AND WORRY KNOWING MY FAMILY HISTORY.
0.285700	I am not anxious or worried at all when I visit the doctor's office. There is not point in it. If something is wrong then worrying about it isn't going to help the situation get any better.
0.309500	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fact that I always have to wait so long before seeing him.  Sometimes I might be in the waiting room for hours.
0.238100	When I do not know what is wrong with me.
0.214300	In case I am feeling bad about something that I think is the worst case scerio and I will not find out until he has examined me or ran some tests. Worrying is mostly in my head and not a result of the doctor himself.
0.738100	finding something else wrong
0.523800	I only get nervous about a bad diagnosis.
0.500000	Not knowing what they're going to tell me or what test they're going to pressure me into taking, which will cost me extra money.
0.642900	I think just the thought of them finding something  wrong is why i get really worried , 
0.642900	I just worry in general about my check up results.  I'm getting older and weigh more than when I was younger.  I just get a bit anxious on blood pressure now too.
0.142900	I can't. I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I feel calm and indifferent, and a bit bored.
0.833300	Feeling embarrassed by something that is going on with me I guess. I think I am more anxious about that than anything else. My health is pretty good, and if it wasn't I don't think I'd really fear that. The money, also, the money makes me extremely worried. I fear having to pay thousands of dollars for my health.  
0.690500	I am always afraid that they are going to find something seriously wrong that I am not aware of.
0.476200	I am most anxious about the unknown and having routine tests uncover something serious that I wasn't aware of. So far there have been no major problems but as I get older I am expecting something sooner or later.
0.809500	I worry about what disease I may have after reading information online about causes of severe pain. I worry about my organs and as I age, there seem to be more things wrong and more things that I have concerns about.
0.619000	Fear of the unknown. I have come because something is wrong and I do not know the answer and I will have a long wait and this will be all I am thinking about because  have to reschedule my whole day to do it.
0.595200	What might come of the visit. Not seeing my doctor, just what may or may not be wrong.
0.547600	My anxiety stems from uncertainty. Each time I go to the doctor for a physical exam, I have to do blood work. Even though I am relatively healthy, I do not know what that blood work would come back saying. This has little to do with my doctor and more to do with just the uncertainty of the human body. 
0.523800	I'm little bit afraid of bad news.
0.571400	You worry about what could possibly be wrong with you. Worry about getting certain things done. or worry about how people percieve you.
0.428600	I'm getting ked in front of a mostly complete stranger who is poking and prodding me, literally looking for things that are wrong...
0.595200	Uncertainty.  Anything can happen. I could be walking out of there and know that I will be dead in a week or I will no nothing more than I did before. 
0.428600	Usually fear about bad outcomes or future illness.  I, like everyone else worried about what could happen.  Even though I know that my condition isn't contingent on whether I am aware of it or not, it's still bothersome to learn.
0.809500	Just the overall experience. You never know what to expect or what they could find that isn't necessarily good.
0.166700	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is if he finds something to be concerned about.
0.642900	I have not been anxious from going to a doctors office in a while.  Everything that I have been told in a while was what I was expecting.
0.857100	I feel like my doctor is judging my body. I feel like I am inferior because I am not in good health and have many problems compared to my doctor.
0.642900	Getting my blood pressure taken and going on the scale to measure my weight. Two things I dont think many people like doing.
0.738100	I fear the unknown just like everyone else.
0.619000	I worry that the doctor will find something that i am uware of. I fear what they find will be painful or expensive to treat.
0.190500	That they might find something that I have wrong with me. I have to doctor a lot for my problems and I'm paranoid that I will get something that is caused by the medicine.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel nervous about seeing a doctor
0.309500	I worry that I may have a serious medical condition. This is usually fretting about nothing, but I continue to worry anyway.
0.571400	I'm worried about something being wrong with me or something that I would not expect. Also the time can be long in waiting and that makes me anxious.
0.285700	If I have been very ill for a long time and there has been nothing to help me for a long time, I would worry wondering if the test results would show some dangerous illness like cancer, aids, etc. which could kill me soon.
0.761900	I am worried that my doctor will be very upset with me because I am not losing weight.  I keep gaining weight.  I am worried that I will eventually have high blood pressure or diabetes.
0.428600	Being in a doctor's office makes me feel anxious because I am vulnerable and surrounded by people I do not know. That is an uncomfortable situation for me. 
0.428600	I worry about new findings or a change in my health.  I also worry if a procedure is going to be uncomfortable or painful.  
0.523800	I have no problem with being in a doctor's office since I used to work in one. But, I do hate when they take my vitals then have me sit for a half hour before doing their quick 5 minute check up. 
0.523800	That I'll get sick from being around so many sick people.
0.833300	I often have to have physical examitions and blood tests.  The blood tests especially incite dread, anxiety, etc in me simply because I know they will hurt.  Even the physicals give me discomfort though.  I also worry about what thing I will have to correct my doctor on this time.
0.428600	I feel most anxious when I have something wrong with my health that I am worried about. 
0.619000	For my mother, any visit to the doctor's office is a possible event filled with dread. Has the cancer spread to her brain yet? How long will she be able to breathe effectively before the tumors in her lungs over power her? For myself? I'm basically as healthy as a horse and entirely apathetic about it.
0.714300	Getting results back from tests when trying to find out if certain symptoms may be signs of a new condition or decline in health will make me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. 
0.238100	Not much really, unless I'm going there because I think there is really something wrong with me. Like finding a lump in my breast or something of that kind. But generally, I feel fine when I go there.
0.500000	What makes me feel anxious sometimes is seeing other patients with various ailments waiting to see their doctors. When I'm thinking there might be something wrong with me, it unsettles me a bit to see other people who aren't well.
0.142900	When I am feeling ill and I don't have a good idea about what is wrong.
0.381000	I am worried that I am going to get bad news or poor test results.
0.381000	I don't like to have closed contact with people in general. Visiting a doctor and having the doctor examine my body is uncomfortable for me. 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. 
0.666700	"A lot of them have elitism or an ego about them. I expereinced this several times with doctors. Or while you are sitting there at your lowest point, barely able to hold your head up, they will talk down to you. YES THEY DO. fuck em. Sorry but I can't with medical doctors. There is so much intellectual elitism and yet they haven't actually ""cured"" anyone of diseases because the underlying issue of what everyone is eating isn't addressed. We act like if we can eat it, it's our food source and will go in and out of the body. Unfortutely people forget that in anything, if you burn dirty, or the wrong fuel, you will RUIN the machine/your body."
0.642900	The fear of them finding something wrong with me.
0.285700	When my doctor is checking my weight I get worried because I am trying to lose weight to control my diabetes 
0.785700	I am most anxious or worried about receiving bad news or requiring a procedure that I'm not comfortable with.
0.166700	Just general anxiety because I've experienced a lot of incorrect diagnoses, and as a result, been prescribed medicine that has a very negative effect on me. I worry about not being listened to. I dread the patient blame that I've experienced.  
0.690500	Not sure what they will say. Sometimes they make me feel bad about myself.
0.500000	More so the results of testing or the results for why Im there.
0.523800	I get anxious when I visit the doctor's office because of the fear of what could be wrong. I think that it is deep rooted from the loss of my first born child.
0.738100	I am mostly nervous about the cost of the visit.  To a lesser extent I am worried about what he might find (ie cancer) or something of that ture. 
0.285700	I don't usually get anxious when I see my doctor.  I might get anxious if I see a new doctor b/c I don't know how he will treat me.
0.238100	How long I will be sitting there.
0.476200	I am always about any appoiment, every time I go se the doctor I just don't like to wait.
0.500000	That they won't know what's wrong, or that they won't take me seriously enough.
0.833300	I get anxious thinking they will think less of me for how little I've taken care of myself. Which is not true really. I exercise every day. Literally every day. The results are not very noticeable, but I would be WAY worse off if I didn't exercise. 
0.571400	The possability for bad news.
0.142900	What makes mw feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office is finding out that there could be something seriously wrong with me and also having to get a shot or blood drawn.
0.500000	I just get anxious for some reason.  I don't like being told something is wrong with me so I get worried.  Also I hate having to give blood or do other procedures that could hurt.
0.238100	Sometimes I see the doctor for exams and they will draw blood so I feel a little anxious
0.404800	Having something wrong with me that will require me to take a medication that is the only option to cure what is wrong with me but at the same time will have side effects which will continue to effect me for a while.
0.142900	I dislike going to the doctor in general so I always feel anxious being in a doctors office.
0.190500	It's uncomfortable and totally abnormal to be semi-ked in an exam room with someone you see once a year at best.   It's going to make anyone anxious.
0.404800	I worry that test results will come back showing something wrong. These worries are usually unfounded.
0.309500	I feel upset if I am being taken care of by a PA/NP instead of an MD. I am wary of their diagnosis or whether or not they are able to give a better assessment than the MD.
0.381000	I am most worried that my doctor will find a new problem or disease when I am examined. I don't want a new disease to deal with. I am also worried that I will lose my health insurance and I won't be able to afford treatment.
0.714300	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office when I am awaiting any test results or physical examitions. I worry because I fear something may be wrong and I would need medical treatment.
0.357100	Since I have a mental health issue on top of physical health issues, am always anxious that they will not take me seriously when I complain of some heart related issue (although I have a heart history).  Unfortutely, a mental health issue is rather like having a giant red mark following you around and often professiols have a hard time looking beyond that for another explation for a problem,
0.404800	I have anxiety just being in medical buildings not because of the doctor herself. I also often feel worried when being examined that something wrong will be found.
0.714300	I am an anxious person anyway. Going to the Dr is a very persol matter, which makes me nervous. You do not know what to expect.
0.238100	Nothing in particular.  I'm pretty much comfortable there.  Nothing has ever happened that I would be terribly anxious.  I think a certain degree of anxiety is normal if you are sick and going to the doctor.  I think the anxiety is more related to the illness or symptoms than seeing the doctor.
0.285700	The bill. And if they can actually help
0.547600	I guess I worry first because it's full of sick people and the energy is negative. Anxiety about the future is also a general condition existent in all and a doctor's office is a good symbol for that. No one knows what the shadow knows.
0.214300	Probably the bill.
0.428600	I am an anxious person in general.  So after having waited in the waiting room, and then waiting again in the exam room as I wait for the doctor to come in I am already getting anxious and worked up.  It's not because I fear what I might learn or what might happen, but I'm just nervous in general about meeting the doctor and the waiting and anticipation helps fuel my nervousness.  I am far more nervous about meeting and talking to the doctor than I am about what might happen or what I might learn during my visit with the doctor.
0.595200	Occasiolly, I may feel anxious at a doctor's office because I have a fear of needles. I always have to lie down when I need them to take a sample of my blood. I also become anxious because if I am unsure about a medicine or pill I haven't taken before, I am worried about the possible side effects.
0.452400	I always dread what the doctor will find out, like if I have some horrible illness. I also feel like he talks at me rather than to me. This worries me because I don't feel that I'm a part of my healing program. 
0.142900	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting for the doctor is when he asks me very private information. I understand why since they are related to my health, but as a private person, it still makes me anxious/worried since I prefer those information to stay in my brain.
0.666700	Not knowing what's wrong with me.  Worrying that it's worse than it actually is.  The fear of not knowing whether or not they are able to help me.
0.833300	I would be most worried about being told I had a terrible disease. I would be andious about being told I needed urgent surgery. I would be worried about being told I needed to take manh drugs for the rest of my life.
0.619000	I am not a people person.  Even though I like my doctor, any time I have one-on-one with people that I do not deal with socially, I am uncomfortable to some degree.  I recognize this, and know that my doctor is there to help, but I am still anxious.  The waiting does not help.
0.404800	When they are in a bad mood. They have a facial expression of someone angry and mad at the world.
0.928600	I feel worried about what could be wrong. I rarely will see a doctor due to the fear that something major could be wrong medically. Also anxious due to feeling like the Dr does not want to be bothered with me as a patient.
0.238100	"When visiting the doctor, there's always a ""what if"".  I'm never scared or worried about my health, per se, but just if something is not feeling right or beginning to come on."
0.642900	The main reason is that I am almost always anxious, especially when around other people, that is something in fact that I would probably be visiting the doctor for.  Other reasons would be just worrying if something may be wrong.  Most of it is due to the fact that I have an anxiety problem and it doesn't really take anything to make me that way.
0.642900	I guess worried that the Doctor may find something wrong or more serious than I thought. The uncertainty of going to a doctors office brings about a tension and I know that elevates my blood pressure. Some times a problem might be embarrassing to talk about and that brings about a feeling of anxiety as well.
0.619000	I dont like waiting. Then I worry that they might find something wrong with me.
0.595200	No one ever wants to hear bad news about their health and when you don't see a physician often, it's likely that there may be underlying issues you are not aware of.
0.142900	I don't usually feel worried or anxious when I go, I live a fairly healthy life and I feel healthy. On the rare occasions where I do feel anxious is when I hurt myself working out. I've sprained my ankle badly before and I felt anxiety cause I didn't know if I broke a bone or something more severe. So the anxiety stems from not knowing the severity of my injuries.
0.738100	Waiting for test results.
0.642900	I sometimes feel somewhat anxious or worried about my general health profile and whether or how much my health might be declining or how much I might be developing risk factors for future problems.
0.238100	Other people that are there that may be sick, and I end up catching what they have.
0.523800	I get worried I won't have the time to ask everything I need,  or that I put it off too long. 
0.404800	When I am there because I know something is wrong, i dislike the suspense of waiting.
0.333300	Contracting something from other sick people, or feeling vulnerable just being in the office when I don't really want to be there.
0.428600	"That there might be something wrong with me that I just didn't ""feel""."
0.690500	I don't like being poked and prodded while wearing a paper gown.
0.285700	there's the inevitable 'you need to be taking a statin' but that doesn't bother me much.  I know its coming, I know she's doing it because thats what the establishment teaches her to do.  my understanding of the issue, based on recent research, tells me different and the establishment it just lagging.
0.761900	Even though my overall health is good, I always worry when I go to the doctor that she is going to find something wrong with me. This is not based on any real evidence or health concerns, but I still worry about it quite a bit.
0.166700	Just the uncertainty of which tests I have to undergo and what shots are going to be given to me.
0.428600	"I get anxious about how the doctor will treat me and whether they will take me seriously.  I'm usually more worried about the doctor dismissing me than I am about them finding a serious health problem.  I also worry about the inevitable ""you're fat"" lecture.  I know it matters, but it still makes me feel bad."
0.547600	The thought of having your blood drawn makes me cringe.
0.142900	When I have a problem and I work myself up by googling signs and symptoms which usually tends to point me towards the worst case scerio.  When i go to the doctor to confirm my conditions, I get anxious waiting to hear what I really have going on.
0.571400	If I already have a bad feeling before going to a doctor then I will be worried that they might confirm my suspicions.
0.571400	I am anxious about what the doctor might find about my health.  Even though I am a healthy individual, there are always some uncertainties.  I just anxious about what he might find even though I believe he will find nothing.
0.285700	I haven't felt anxious or worried about visiting a doctor's office since I was a small child. I don't really enjoy sitting nude with nothing but a paper shirt on, but it doesn't make me anxious or worried. 
0.666700	With some health care providers in the past, I felt that they were too rushed and a little rough. During my first pregncy, I saw one doctor in the practice who gave me a quick, rough interl exam. Even my husband was cringing. When a doctor's bedside manner is impersol and they seem rushed for time, it usually makes me feel nervous, and I am much less likely to ask questions, lest I annoy the doctor.
0.285700	I am anxious just because I do not want to get a bunch of drugs to take that are bad for me.
0.142900	"Nothing. I don't worry or get anxious. Worry is a waste of time. Mark Twain said ""I have worried about a lot of things in my life, and some of them actually happened.""  People need to relax. If anything, maybe the bill would worry me, or that a treatment needed would be way too expensive to get. "
0.619000	I just generally feel that I am worried to discover that something is wrong with me. If I am just there for a checkup, you never know what it is you are going to find out. Just the atmosphere of being around other suffering people makes me anxious.
0.142900	the results of whats wrong with me 
0.666700	I mostly feel anxious when I am at the doctor because I don't like needles or pain whatsoever. If I have to give blood or get an exam, I get so nervous because the pain makes me feel sick.
0.738100	Not having a proper conversation that may get to a root.
0.928600	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me!  I do not like them trying to talk me into testing that I do not want.  I used to fuss about my weight and my blood pressure.
0.666700	The uncertainty of what may be found during the visit
0.904800	I just hate being out of my element and hate having people I don't know touch me
0.761900	Will I be helped or just shoved through the system?  We don't see doctors anymore unless we can pay their price to see them.  We see s now and while I'm sure they are very good I'd like to know why doctors are letting them take over when they went to school for.
0.666700	I am a bit uncomfortable being social in general outside of people I know very well, so I'm usually more worried I am going to make a fool of myself. I also worry that the doctor will be disappointed with the ways I have been handling myself, even though I've never been treated harshly for such a thing. Filly, there is always the small worry of finding out about a debilitating condition that might change my life.
0.857100	Getting some sty infectious disease or being given news about some complication with regards to my health. I really don't trust doctors or visiting them for any reason. I try to stay relatively healthy to avoid having to go to one.
0.809500	Having found the possibility of a life threatening diagnosis.  If not then a chronic disease.
0.714300	It's just the uncertainty. I don't know what they're going to do or say and I don't necessarily trust that they'll make the right decision. As such I just feel a general nervousness and uncertainty when going in.
0.571400	"I am always worries about getting ""grim news"" about a symptom I go see my doctor about.  I know being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness is rare, but I always feel I will be one of the unlucky ones who gets that bad news."
0.666700	I get anxious just being there. I am a person with high anxiety, so just being in the doctors office causes me as great deal of anxiety. I also get anxious that something will be wrong with me.
0.547600	I don't like attention being on me. I always feel anxious when being seen for myself (and not my kids) and being examined. I would prefer to just skip over all of it!
0.142900	Getting weighed 
0.261900	That the examition/treatment might be painful (such as the time when I had an ingrown toeil remedied).
0.642900	I worry about what could be wrong with me.  It's not the doctor that makes me nervous. It's dealing with sickness.
0.690500	I feel most anxious or worried when it comes to what the doctor might tell me is wrong with me. When I am waiting to see the doctor, my mind starts to race with negative thoughts. While I understand the doctor is there to help, I would usually not be seeing the doctor at all if there was nothing wrong with me.
0.238100	I don't feel anxious about the visit. I have lived a healthy lifestyle. I don't expect bad news.
0.690500	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something seriously wrong.  I worry that someday he will discover that I have a serious health condition.  As I get older these concerns are slowly increasing.
0.738100	Because I'am getting older not any younger.
0.619000	The only thing that makes me nervous is the thought of my doctor actually finding something that could potentially kill me.  I get extremely nervous sometimes, but so far it's always be fine.
0.261900	Hearing news that is not good.
0.809500	I have medical PTSD from a very bad experience with an ambulance and hospital. Anything medical worries me. The nurse, in particular, is rude and has no business being in health care. She has mocked my mental health and has gotten away with it. I am afraid of actually telling them how I feel because of this. 
0.642900	I only have two doctors. I don't like going to my primary care doctor because I don't feel any connection with him. I only go when I really have to, and I feel like I'm judged there, both by my doctor somewhat, and by his assistants. I don't get anxious or worried when I visit my other doctor. 
0.547600	With many problems due to a gastric bypass and anemia, I get worried when I have stomach issues or symptoms related to anemia so when I go to Dr. I think the worst in those cases.
0.785700	What makes me feel most anxious or worried about going to see a doctor is that I'm very nervous to tell someone my problems because they might not understand or they might judge me. 
0.452400	I would be worried that something may be bad as I get older.  I typically have good health, but always think the next visit could show a bad diagnosis, worse health, etc...something that could impact my family as well as myself.
0.285700	I only feel anxious if I feel like the doctor has something to tell me but aren't being straight with me. 
0.738100	Bad news. That is all that needs to be said. There may be things that are wrong with you and you may find out on that visit. You could have cancer, you could have lupus- there are thousands of potential scerios that will start to unfold after that visit and its only human to be scared of those potential outcomes.
0.809500	First off I have social anxiety and general anxiety. So everything makes me anxious.  Second off having a strange person poke and prod at me bothers me to a high degree.  Then there is the worry about whether something is wrong physically with me.  
0.833300	I know that they are there to make money.  I don't want to be another product along the factory line.
0.142900	Im most anxious that the doctor will miss something important, just give me a medication that I don't need and then push me out the door to fend for myself.
0.976200	I had GAD, so even small issues cause my anxiety to kick into overdrive.
0.142900	Nothing, it doesn't make me anxious to go to the doctor.
0.476200	Fear of the unknown. Afraid of receiving a diagnosis that is far worse than something I have previously suspected.
0.666700	Fear of receiving bad news, fear of a painful procedure, fear of expensive medical bill
0.714300	They might find something seriously wrong with you, or they need to perform some invasive procedure.
0.142900	I worry about the cost of the care I am receiving.
0.785700	I am worried something is wrong with me, or what other tests and labs or procedures might be recommended. I also worry about money. Sometimes I worry that I am not explaining my issues correctly, or that my doctor is not considering all angles of my care, even though I know he tries. 
0.428600	The feeling of the unknown is probably what makes me the most anxious.  I try not to think too hard about it, but there is always a possibility of getting bad news when anyone is visiting the doctor.  
0.190500	It's the unknown, the uncertainty of it.  If I am there, it's because I was uble to figure it out on my own, or uble to gain access to what I need to treat myself.  Again, a Dr should be viewed as a partner in helping you achieve good health.
0.833300	I just don't usually trust people in general that easily. I also hate that I feel like there job is to judge my everything I do. I feel like many doctors don't follow their own advice which makes them hypocritical. 
0.547600	I just don't like al the poking and prodding, and the overly eager attitude to just prescribe medication for every little thing.
0.642900	I always feel anxious when I have to wait for test results. I am also anxious when a doctor does not have a quick solution to my health problems.
0.642900	I get most anxious about being diagnosed with something else, haha. The doctor doesn't make me nervous, just the whole idea of potentially having another thing wrong with me.
0.690500	When I go to the doctor's office I have a hard time not thinking of the worst possible outcome. All the uncertainty can give me anxiety. 
0.761900	The thing that makes me the most worried when visiting the doctor is the unknown.  That I will find out some dreaded news that I did not know before. 
0.142900	Just making sure I am doing what is right for my body, keeping my blood pressure in check and following my heart meds as expected.  I sometimes worry that my benign condition will suddenly become something to worry about.
0.142900	Getting to my appointment on time.
0.142900	I don't have any anxious feelings. I've know this doctor for many years and he is a nice person as well as a good doctor.
0.261900	When i feel something is wrong with my body and I'm hoping it is nothing too bad. 
0.761900	I'm anxious because I don't know what is wrong with me and I don't have any confidence in finding a solution. Mostly, I just go to get relief from whatever is ailing me but I don't expect to be healed.
0.761900	It's always a little awkward to have a physical.  I worry that my breath smells.
0.690500	My doctor seems reluctant to prescribe me certain medications, and it makes me think that he views me as someone who is drug seeking.
0.595200	When I go to the doctor, I find myself far more concerned with the costs associated with being there than I am with my actual health. I feel like I constantly have to decided between taking care of my health and mainting fincial security. Knowing that medical procedures can be very expensive causes me serious anxiety and stress.
0.881000	I worry because I have bad habits. I know he' going to tell me things I don't want to hear.
0.619000	The thing that makes me most anxious is probably the possibility of having some horrible disease. For all I know, I could go in for a checkup feeling fine and walk out knowing that I have cancer. At the same time I get kind of worried about the doctor misdiagnosing me or missing something important.
0.928600	I have a lifelong phoboa of doctors/hospitals, etc. Big time. Comes from a near death when I was three. Ratiolly/intellectually I know it is safe and good and helpful, but my body and mind go FEAR to the enth power. I even sweat walking by an ambulance. Have tried everything and can't undo it. 
0.500000	I am usually not very anxious about going and seeing a doctor.  Seeing a new doctor for the first time always makes me anxious or if I'm worried about my current symptoms and her diagnosis but generally, I'm not anxious about seeing my current doctor when I need to.
0.714300	Just the fact that I'm sick enough to be at the doctor's is enough to make me sick. Then I also start worrying about how I'm going to come up with the money to pay the over-inflated doctors' fees.
0.571400	What makes me anxious or worried is the uncertainty of not knowing what might be causing me to feel unwell. Whether is it something serious or minor.
0.333300	I tend to feel anxious because I really don't like getting exams. I feel worried because I tend to feel like something will be found even if I am a healthy person.
0.261900	I guess it is the fear of not knowing.
0.547600	I tend to worry a great deal about the bill.  This makes me overall anxious of the types of tests, etc.  When I am going for a specific issue - as opposed to a check up - I am often a little anxious about what the issue will be.  Will it cause me pain?  Can I recover quickly and easily or will it be on going?  Will it be expensive to treat?
0.547600	I am most anxious or worried about them finding something I did not expect that will negatively impact my health. I am also worried that they will tell me I have been doing something wrong or that I am putting on too much weight.
0.619000	The most anxious part is the waiting, whether it is in the waiting room or inside one of the examition rooms. It is the time where I think about what's going to happen, what the doctor might say, and the necessary questions I need to ask. Since I don't know all of this ahead of time, I'm trying to think of questions for any scerio, which is stressful. 
0.833300	May receive news/diagnosis that you do not want to hear
0.357100	What makes me most anxious when visiting the doctor is myself. Aside from strep throat, which I get fairly often, I usually have a worse case scerio that turns out not to be so bad afterward. 
0.666700	I just get myself worked up for no good reason. I hate going there, even though I have never had a horrible experience. I guess I don't like other people poking, prodding, and seeing me ked. I am the same way about going to the dentist or giving blood.
0.142900	I'm in good health so I am never nervous about seeing my doctor. I go once a year for a check-up. The only thing that bothers me is the blood draw that he orders each time, this is needed to monitor my PSA because of a previous cancer diagnosis.  I also don't care much for the colonoscopy I must endure every three years.
0.666700	I wonder whether I am going to have wait a long time. I also wonder whether something is going to be wrong with me. 
0.547600	I hate feeling like I might have some lingering undetectable disease that's going to kill me at any time and suddenly finding out about it and realizing I only have a few months to live.
0.428600	I'm generally worried about my condition. Or the news they'll give me. Or some intrusive test.
0.476200	When I go because I do not feel well it makes me anxious that they will not find anything wrong and I will continue to suffer because they cant figure out whats wrong.
0.666700	i worry about getting weighed when i go to the doctor. i don't want to gain a few pounds and the doctor say something to me about it. i also worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me and then i'll have to deal with a tough situation. another thing i worry about is sweating. i get nervous about seeing the doctor for whatever reason and i get sweaty. that's kind of embarrassing.
0.785700	It's just a weird experience altogether. Having a stranger poke and prod me is not something that makes me feel comfortable. They ask a lot of questions and the little gowns are way too small and don't make me feel any less ked.
0.452400	I have had a serious condition in the past. It's not the doctor it's what she might find.
0.738100	What makes me most anxious is finding out that I have some horrible sort of disease or illness. I also tend to feel worried that I'll be taken advantage of.
0.690500	I worry that there will be something seriously wrong even if I am just going in for a cold.  Many times I think about what could be the worst possible scerio as far as sickness could go.  Or I am afraid that the doctor won't be able to figure out what the problem is and I will have to continue to be in pain.
0.833300	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor will start telling me that some of my symptoms are all in my head or that the doctor will decide that he wants to try some new treatment.  I am very drug sensitive and don't do well when I have to take a new drug.  I have had way too many bad reactions to medications, so now I have anxiety over any new medication I try.
0.738100	basically i feel uneasy because it's a sense of what is gon be wrong this time? i also in the back of my mind wonder if i will be mis diagnosed based on previous bad experience of filly getting wrist surgery 8 months too late
0.309500	I am most anxious about screenings for diseases such as cancer and heart because there's always an element of doubt on how the results will be and if I would require further tests. 
0.142900	Nothing really. I'm always calm about going to the doctor, even if I do feel sick or injured. I guess I just think positive the entire time. I don't know. It never bothered me or worried to go and see a doctor.
0.381000	I get anxious about being weighed, about what my blood pressure will be and about getting ked.
0.666700	Doctors finding tumors.
0.500000	When I first started going to him it had been quite a while since I have had a primary doctor. I was very anxious about my test results. I had 2 serious issues. The first one is completely under control now. We are working on the second. This had decreased my anxiety. I guess my anxiety stems from not knowing about any issues I have.
0.142900	I guess I am sometimes anxious when I feel I might have something wrong with me. I get a bit worried about what it actually is and whether it is dangerous. Otherwise I am never worried about the actually doctor's office visit itself.
0.785700	Well when its a cold or the flu it isn't that bad. It's when you don't know what illness you have that's really scary. When you have this unexplained pain that doesn't go away and you mistakenly look on the internet for answers towards what it may be. Even without the internet, sitting there with pain in an area that could have a serious illness like cancer, waiting for the doctor to come back with his diagnoses would make anyone anxious. Simply, people fear hearing the possibility of bad news, no matter how big or small. 
0.690500	I worry about the communication aspect of a doctor's visit. I know that I will not ask the questions that I should ask and may not remember the information they have told me.
0.285700	That I might find out something new I have to deal with, when I really don't have the time or patience for more medical drama. 
0.690500	finding out something bad
0.500000	What kind of news I might get. I worry about what they'll say about my unhealthy lifestyle. The might say something about seeing other doctors.
0.642900	Always worried that something I can't fix will go wrong. I'm like that with everything not just medical problems. Bring my car to the mechanic and wait anxiously until I get the diagnosis. Same is true of my health. I'm sick I go in to find out what's wrong but going to be anxious until i get the all clear.
0.833300	Are they going to see my scars and ask me about them? What if they call the police on me and have me committed against my will?
0.642900	Mostly my weight. It has been an issue due to some of the medications I am on. I worry that I have gained weight each time I visit and that my doctor will comment on it. I also worry about the blood test results I have done each month and hope that they reflect that the medications I am on are working so I don't have to change medications yet again.
0.761900	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is that I do not know what to expect each time with my persol health and hoping that nothing is going to come up as wrong or a health issue. I also get anxious about just sitting in the waiting room and wondering what will happen when I get called into the office. 
0.333300	I am mostly worried about long waits. I am sometimes worried about a possible diagnosis.I am sometime worried bout the doctor's mood.
0.547600	I have more of an untural fear of doctors and dentists. This is most likely due to the fact that I so seldom need to see a doctor. If I had been unhealthy and seen a lot of doctors, I suspect I would be way more comfortable with the process. But I assume it's much better to be healthy and see a doctor seldom and to be sick and see a doctor so often as to not be uncomfortable.  :)
0.833300	I worry that a simple problem is actually the beginning stages of something serious. I also worry that the doctor may miss something that leads to prescribing the wrong medication.
0.952400	I don't like the atmosphere of doctors offices. I don't like feeling like just another number coming through. I don't feel like I'm being heard or cared about when I am visiting the doctor. 
0.809500	I just hate going there I've always been that way. It's kind of hard to explain. The doctor isn't a big deal but the nurses and assistants are different all the time and do different things like look at different things I don't think really matters. Then there expressions change and they say nothing so this makes me anxious. So pretty much the whole thing I hate, I'm just always happy to get out of there.
0.523800	That something severe is wrong with me
0.571400	Will I remember to tell them all the necessary information.
0.357100	That he's going to tell me something bad. I worry I'll have some medical condition that requires extensive treatment.
0.714300	That they will give me bad news, and that the treatment will be something I'm uncomfortable with. 
0.571400	You never know what is wrong, I get nervous going to the dr with a  complaint not knowing what it is.
0.261900	Recently I worry more about if the doctor will accept my health insurance, than if there is something wrong with me. Also, I'm worrying how much of the bill is my responsibility and how much insurance's.
0.619000	I guess there's always the back-of-the-mind fear that the doctor will find something wrong. That's not usually a huge concern for me, though, because I've always been quite healthy aside from my weight, which I'm working on. Mostly I'm just anxious because there's nearly always SOMETHING uncomfortable in a doctor's visit. Taking off more clothes than I'd like to, or painful examitions (and I have a VERY low pain threshold - I consider those blood pressure cuffs painful), or being told yet again that I'm overweight as if I couldn't see that for myself.
0.357100	Just the waiting process makes me nervous because I just want to get it over with. Usually, doctors visits have been pleasant but I just want to get them over with so I can continue my day. If I sit in the office waiting for a long time, I start getting stressed over the potential wait in regards to whatever I have planned after, and it just makes me nervous overall waiting.
0.595200	I feel anxious or worried that I may find ou bad news. I worry that some of my bad habits may have caught up with me. I am concerned I will receive bad test results 
0.690500	Concern that there may be something severely wrong with me.  I also would hate to get blood drawn. 
0.690500	I am sometimes worried about what diagnosis the doctor may give when I have a serious health concern. I also get worried that the doctor may dismiss my concerns or that I won't be taken seriously.
0.690500	If I have something wrong with me that is concerning me that I want looked at, yes I feel anxious. If I am just going for a yearly wellness visit, I am at ease.
0.500000	Not sure what they're going to say, if something is wrong with me.
0.666700	"I am always worried I am going to get a ""death sentence"".  I also worried that the procedure will hurt.  I also worry that the doctor will tell me something that I should be doing, because what I am doing is not good enough."
0.500000	I am just worried that something is more wrong than I thought was actually wrong with me when I went in there. I like being in control of my body but I just fear hearing bad news.
0.476200	When I have a gynecological or sensitive problem that I feel embarrassed about. I'm getting to be less worried about that but especially when I was young that was a main area of discomfort.
0.333300	It's extremely silly, but ever since I had to learn to perform blood pressure readings in a high school atomy and physiology class I find the idea of the brachial artery being shut off extremely creepy, which stresses me out and raises my (actually a bit too low, when it can be accurately measured) blood pressure. I then get anxious about the fact that the reading will be incorrect, which makes me worry more and drives the reading sky-high. It's an annoying and very nerve-wracking cycle that happens almost every time I go to a doctor's office.
0.738100	If I visit a doctor's office, I'm worried about several things. I worry that something is wrong with me and it's going to be worse than I imagined. I also worry that I will be misdiagnosed, and I also worry about what the doctor or his nurses think of me, particularly if I have to disrobe during the examition.
0.238100	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I can never be completely sure what diagnosis I am going to get. It would be silly to say I wasn't worried or anxious that I could get some negative news regarding my health.
0.309500	Even though I'm comfortable at my doctors office and have known him for years, I always get a little anxious when going in for an exam. I think it's mostly because I'm worried about what they'll find that's wrong. Most of the time it's only something minor or nothing at all, but I still get a little worried.
0.738100	Mostly just the fact the person is usually someone I haven't met before because I do not have a stable family doctor, and also the cost. 
0.214300	I will be worried if they will told me to undergo medication because I will need money in order to that.  I hate expenses.
0.261900	Just the idea that even though everything feels and looks good, there's the possibility that something is wrong. The unknown is what makes me the most worried.
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.
0.190500	I don't worry much when visiting the doctor.
0.500000	Just that I may have to switch medications or that something new will be discovered. That she will not be able to find or fix what is wrong. That she won't give me a recommendation if she feels it is not needed. 
0.619000	I tend to expect the worst so I often feel anxious about what the actual diagnosis will be. 
0.428600	I dont like needels  
0.738100	I am worried about them finding something big wrong with me.  Something that would change my life drastically or something that cannot be fixed.
0.142900	I'm more worried about the cost than anything else. I'm very healthy, but I'm afraid of the high cost of falling ill and having any medical issue. That's what concerns me the most 
0.261900	Because instead of addressing the source of symptoms they usually just give you something to cover up the symptom while the underlying causes just get worse. And also because they are very time inefficient. I once had to sit in a room for an hour and a half with very excruciating pain just for the doctor to figure out my nose was broken, which i already knew but he didnt think so
0.857100	I feel anxious at the doctor because I never know what they will tell me. That alone worries me. What do I have to pay for next is the question in my head.
0.285700	The anxious part is just the exams in general. I don't have great health insurance so if they find anything wrong I couldn't be able to afford it.
0.285700	In good general health. Not expecting any surprises. Mostly go for routine annual checkups.
0.428600	What the diagnosis will be. If there is anything wrong with me. 
0.595200	I usually do not have anything serious wrong with me so that is not a worry. However, I am always just a little bit afraid that they will find something new is wrong with me that I didn't even know about. I know this is not likely but it is still a fear of mine. 
0.166700	Nothing really nowâ because we have had the same Doctor for several years and we know him and converse openly with him. He is friendly and remembers persol details about us which help a lot. He is always open and honest and has always taken very good care of us when we have had needs. We both go to the Doctor regularly and because of that and our relationship with the Doctor there is a large level of comfort now
0.547600	I worry that my blood pressure will be high again and that worry makes it worse.  I also worry that my disease will be out of remission and I will not be able to work.
0.333300	Anixous that there will be something wrong.
0.714300	Obviously, that something is wrong. That you've gone in for something routine and there may be more going on than what you were prepared for. For example, going in for something that you thought was a swollen lymph node and being apprehensive that it could be cancer. I think about these sorts of things when I have an appointment. 
0.666700	They will get me hooked on some medication that makes me worse and dependent on office visits. 
0.333300	If they were to tell me that I have a loss or restriction of mobility.
0.357100	The only thing that i usually dislike is getting my blood pressure taken. Not only have the PA's taken incorrect readings on many occasions, but , because i had hypertension in the past (since resolved) i still fear getting a high reading. Usually my heart rate elevates a bit while i'm getting it done. 
0.547600	I get worried if they can't figure out what is wrong relatively quickly. I would start to think it is something serious and potentially lose sleep over it. Luckily, I've only had that happen a few times, and in the end the problem was resolved.
0.404800	I am most worried about whether or not the diagnosis will be something minor or major.
0.381000	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is that something could possibly be wrong. Even if I go for a normal checkup and I do not have any signs of anything being wrong with me, just going to the doctor makes me slightly anxious because I know that if there is any bad results this is the place it will come from. 
0.404800	a possibility to hear something bad about my health
0.452400	I feel worried if I think I will get a bad result or hear something I don't want to. I also get nervous around needles. 
0.452400	If I'm sick but I don't know what I have, I might be a little anxious to hear what the diagnosis is.
0.928600	I am afraid that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I am also afraid that the doctor will make a mistake or mis-prescribe me a wrong medication. I also feel that the doctors do not really listen when I tell them something. 
0.571400	I feel anxious when I require blood draws and I also get anxious sitting in the waiting room. I get worried that there could be something wrong when things progress so slowly during the appointments. 
0.285700	that my doctor is not well informed of my health needs prior to and during the visit
0.476200	Wondering if something is wrong
0.381000	Just hearing her 'official' word on lab results, I'd say. I've normally already looked at the numbers thanks to an online portal where they post results, but I don't necessarily know what they mean and I don't generally feel like doing research (e.g. to see if a small change in my triglycerides is significant) when I know I'll see her within a week (lab work always a week before I see her, results usually online a few days prior to appointment with her). It's ever so slight. 
0.357100	I can't put a finger on it, but possibly hearing that I am doing poorly in some aspect of my health.  I try to be a healthy person, but it would be hard to hear that something is seriously wrong, and I guess that's where I become anxious.
0.595200	I feel nervousness in general, like maybe the doctor will find something that wasn't there before. I am worried they will lecture me about smoking cigarettes. And I am just anxious in general when I go out in public.
0.809500	I am anxious because I can't predict my results. I am most scared of being told my health is in a poor state. Bad news could possibly come out and I wouldn't know what to do about it. 
0.142900	Waiting around sick people, more often than most.
0.642900	i have hypertension and when i go to the doctor, my bp is typically higher than outside the office. the thought of it going higher at the office makes it go higher at the office if you know what i mean. i also don't being weighed as i am currently overweight.
0.738100	I am worried there might be a problem I'm not aware of, especially high blood pressure or thyroid issues which run in my family. I also feel like the nurse and doctors at the practice I go to don't really listen to my concerns much. 
0.738100	My anxiety when visiting a doctor's office is pretty irratiol, but I can't deny that I feel it. It's largely because of the uncertainty of the experience. Even if I feel that I am in good health, it's possible that the doctor could tell me I am in poor health or have a condition I was uware of. Though knowing about the condition would be positive overall, it is a frightening thing. 
0.595200	I used to feel worried when discussing the symptoms and progression of sickness. Now I don't care to the same degree unless I am presented with a new symptom. 
0.142900	nothing -I do get upset and tend to walk out if he she has not seen me within 30 minutes of my appointment
0.381000	I feel afraid that the doctor won't have enough time for me, or he'll brush off my questions. Those are my two biggest concerns when I go to the doctor. I don't like my opinion to be brushed off or disregarded, and I hate feeling as though my concerns don't matter. It also makes me really anxious that I wait 45 minutes to see a doctor and then the overall appointment takes only 90 seconds. It just makes me feel really worried that I'm not getting the care or attention that I should be. 
1.000000	I HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS.
0.142900	I think what would make me feel most anxious would be if my doctor found something wrong with me
0.381000	I WAS FEELING WORRIED ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME OR IF MY CONDITION WAS IMPROVING. I GUESS I AM ALWAYS ANXIOUS ABOUT GETTING ON MORE MEDICATION THAN I WANT TO.
1.000000	Just that I don't go very often at all, and I'm not young. Sooner or later, they are going to find something wrong. I also don't like getting undressed for anyone. I have major self esteem issues, and as I said, I am a very nervous person. 
0.571400	Not knowing what is wrong with me and I get worried about if anything has gotten worse
0.142900	I really don't feel anxious or worried at all going to the doctor. I feel relieved that I am going to get better with her help. I guess a worry would always be finding out news that you may die soon, but I'm young so I really don't think about that.
0.881000	What makes me anxious is the possibility of having a serious condition. I know it's just a small chance of it, but just the possibility of that make me very nervous and scared. 
0.714300	Ever since I found out I have a rare blood disease I feel a sense of dread and worry whenever I see the doctor.  It passes as soon as she tells me everything is okay, but up until that moment, I feel worried and nervous.
0.785700	A physical exam is generally unpleasant to me. I worry about what professiols might think about my body, or me in general. I also worry that something unexpected might show up and my health is declining.
0.976200	The fact that they make assumptions and don't listen to me. I've witnessed them giving incorrect information to other people and I'm always annoyed that they will do the same to me. So just based off of previous encounters, I dread that. 
0.500000	Even though I'm very healthy overall and generally feel pretty good, there's always that gging idea in the background that they may discover something seriously wrong that isn't currently presenting any symptoms. It's also just an anxious situation in general when another person you don't know well - or know at all - is examining your body and mind and peering into some persol and private things, even if you trust them to be objective and professiol about it.
0.333300	I tend to be anxious in general. I worry the doctor won't understand my concern, won't be able to help me or will choose not to.
0.500000	It is a woman and though I am not ashamed to undress for her,it still leels a little bit uneasy.I would feel worried,when I have to see her,when I have sudden complaints,that don't go away.
0.214300	Obviousley, him finding out I'm sick. Him finding out something on me is broken. Or even him telling me I'm uble to reproduce. 
0.333300	The possibility of finding something I don't want hear.
0.142900	nothing makes me feel most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor's office... 
0.881000	I am worried that they will find something serious. Although I'd rather know than not know.
0.928600	I am always concerned that they will find something that will require further testing. In my past experience, further tests can be expensive and painful, and for me have always turned out fine. But even still, it is scary to decide to ignore the doctor's advice and not do further tests. 
0.357100	Having someone poke me and hover around me. I like my space.
0.642900	I have a tendency to avoid going to the doctor unless it's necessary (even though I know it's not smart), so when I do go, it's usually because something is wrong. I worry that it's going to be something more serious than what I expect, or that something else wrong will be found. It's not really the exam itself that bothers me, but the potential for serious health problems.
0.523800	I worry that he might find something that I didn't know about.  Like some growth or cancer or something.  It's just the unknown and then what it might lead to. 
0.285700	I only sometimes experience slight anxiety. This comes from a general sense that there could be something wrong with my health.
0.666700	You are always a bit on edge hoping that you won't find out you have a terrible illness. I feel like I don't know my doctor anymore so it's very impersol and makes you feel a bit awkward in telling someone so much about you. I also feel like there isn't enough time to be told things in detail.
0.952400	I have social anxiety. Going to see a doctor is like being asked to perform on broadway completely ked without ever having been given a script. You don't know what to expect. You feel like the doctor might be secretly judging you, and when it's all done you might find out that you are gon be dead in a month.
0.571400	I feel anxious because I know she is always going to find something wrong. If it isn't my thyroid it is something else. I am worried because she always wants to put me on that blood pressure medicine with a diuretic, which made me sick and pass out constantly last time. My doctor is a real piece of work. She doesn't think of the tural approach to things.
0.238100	I REALLY DO NOT FEEL VERY ANXIOUS GOING TO THE DOCTOR UNLESS I GO THERE WITH SOME COMPLAINT. IN THAT CASE, I HAVE A SLIGHT WORRY THAT THE CONDITION MAY BE MORE SERIOUS, PERSISTENT, OR REQUIRE MORE ATTENTION THAN I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH. ALMOST ALL MY VISITS ARE FOR ROUTINE CHECK-UPS, AND I FEEL NO ANXIETY ABOUT THEM.
0.357100	Sometimes, I felt uncertain about my disease condition and related treatments when visiting the doctor's office. I was not sure if I should take a new medicine for my disease. 
0.881000	Blood work mostly, procedures that could go wrong, not really listening to me. The whole thing is a stressor.
0.738100	Generally I am worried about the possibility of needing to get my blood drawn, as I have a severe phobia of injections.
0.476200	I'm anxious about what he might say I have and it's untreatable and that worries me a lot.
0.761900	Honestly, that they think I am exaderatting my symptoms - or that they will not know what to do and i go undigainosed or mis diagnosed because they are not allowed to perform the tests that they should be cause of cost
0.690500	Shame, afraid that I will be judged for not taking better care of myself. Anxious based on past experience when the doctors wouldn't listen to me and couldn't figure out what was wrong.
0.690500	I worry about all the things that could be wrong with me that I didn't notice, but the doctor might find out. These might be expensive to fix, or embarassing, or something that I was foolish not to notice on my own. I might not be in as good of health as I had thought.
0.523800	I feel most anxious about getting a bad diagnosis. But on the flip side I also feel anxious that my doctor will not take my symptoms seriously and will think I'm overreacting (it's happened to me too many times).
0.714300	Fincial requirements are number one. I have insurance but can not afford very much out of pocket expense. As far as whether the treatment is correct, I seldom worry about that cause I can just skip the recommended treatment when I get home. So I have to make sure whatever is done is covered by insurance or I probably will not do it.
0.666700	  If someone there or around is ging to get me sick.  If someone will give me the wrong diagnosis.  If someone will give me the wrong medication.
0.309500	That the doctor might find something wrong with my health.
0.500000	I worry that the doctor may find something serious wrong with me, and I worry that he may prescribe tests or medications that will cost more money than I can afford to spend. I'm fairly healthy, so mostly I worry about the costs.
0.523800	I have had breast cancer and am now always ready for the shoe to drop when I am in to see her.
0.142900	The language barrier.
0.381000	I am afraid that my blood pressure is going to be high and then this will be the visit I'm stuck on blood pressure meds.
0.142900	The times that I have felt anxious has been when I didn't know what was wrong.  I had knee pain a few years ago after injuring it playing basketball.  I was nervous or anxious that I would find out after examining it that I would need major surgery.  It turned out to not be a big deal and I just needed to rest and rehab it, but it was a very anxiety inducing day for me. 
0.142900	The thought of having a newly discovered illness is what tends to worry me the most about visiting a doctor. I always have a fear when new tests are run the doctor may discover cancer or some other life-threatening illness.
0.619000	I get worried about cost of visit and needed things after. I also get anxious thinking they will have nothing but bad news for me.
0.761900	I am a generally anxious and uneasy person. I takes a lot for me to trust someone on a persol level. Therefore, my visit's to the doctor tend to bring on anxiety and worry.
0.142900	I get a little worried when my doctor recommends something I don't want to do (like a colonoscopy). In general, however, I am not worried at all. My doctor knows that I might not agree with everything he says and I always have the option of going to another doctor.
0.142900	I might have to waste some time in the waiting room.  I prefer to spend my time as I choose to spend it.
0.500000	That I will receive bad news - whether that is pregncy or a medical condition I didn't expect.
0.571400	The unknown. Possibility that they will find something wrong with me that requires medical attention. 
0.452400	I feel these feelings sometimes because i do not always know what to expect from my doctor. I also dont know what they may find wrong with me if anything. It is always a nerve wrecking experience.
0.214300	I have a general anxiety disorder so sometimes even the most common events can make me feel anxious. It really has nothing to do with the appointment. it just happens.
0.500000	I hate going to pay a copay and then not get what I feel is the best option for me. It stresses me out to go and also I don't drive so getting there its not an easy task in general. So its just getting there and still having unresolved concern.
0.476200	"Always experiencing the worst case scerio when identifying illness. For instance, ""my leg pain is getting bad"" with the doctor response of ""well, I guess we should saw it completely off""."
0.666700	The actual exam. I just don't like people touching me that way.
0.857100	The whole think.  The waiting, the gowns, the sterile environment.  It makes me very anxious.
0.785700	I am worried that my doctor will do a seemingly common test that will indicate i have a life-threatening medical condition that i was completely oblivious to.
0.714300	Being told things I already know or cannot do anything about makes me feel anxious. Also, being examined makes me feel vulnerable. I had an ob once who called me fat the entire time I was pregnt and that I would be obese after giving birth. I knew I had gained a lot of weight but I was eating well and was exercising. Being pregnt I felt like I had no control over being able to actually lose weight until after giving  birth. It ended up I had edema and lost 45lbs in 4 weeks after delivery but ever since sometimes I feel anxious, dread or worrysome when doctors tell me something I already know eapecially if it is something I have little control over or are currently working on.
0.428600	I don't feel much anxiety when I'm at the doctor's office.
0.333300	I sometimes feel worried when visiting the doctors office because if I am there it's because I'm not feeling well.  But I feel regular checkups are a good thing to stay healthy.
0.261900	If I have a real issue that is not just pedantic-like complaining---that it will not be thoroughly dealt with due to insufficient time alone. That would be some mega bullshit. It's why Im trying to learn a lot as to how I can effectively help myself through altertive medicine options such as aryuvedic. 
0.285700	How seevere is my condition.Some doctors like to practice fear mongering.
0.238100	Visiting a new doctor can be a bit stressful because I don't know if he/she will listen to me or be accepting of me. Beyond that, there is always a bit of anxiety that something might be wrong with my health.
0.214300	"I think there is a general anxiety when visiting a doctor or dentist's office. I feel more anxious when I am in the office because of a serious problem I am having. The anxiety is not caused by the doctor but rather by the possibility my ""ailment"" might turn out to be serious."
0.142900	For now, I don't feel that way because I trust my Doctor so much.Seems that he is my family or brother
0.381000	I am worried that my doctor will discover a health issue and not be able to adequately explain the cause or offer treatment solutions.
0.785700	That I've either come in about an issue that's too trivial to need a doctor's attention, or that I've waited too long on an issue when I should have known it was more serious. Basically that there are multiple ways my own judgement could be wrong. That I'll embarrass myself by making a bigger deal out of something than is warranted. That I might have to redirect a conversation of the doctor seems to jump to wrong conclusions or makes bad assumptions.
0.595200	What makes me feel worried is the thought of a bad health report. As I get older and my body starts to slow down, I feel I'm more prone to bad health. What if I suddenly have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or my urine shows signs of XYZ, etc, If a doctor comes back with news like that, it's sure to have me worried at least a little.
0.595200	it might be bad experiences in my childhood
0.142900	That they will find something wrong/incurable. 
0.857100	"I feel the most anxious about the unknown.  Even totally healthy people can have bad things happen and I have not been living the healthiest lifestyle.  I worry that there will be something wrong with me that cannot be ""fixed."""
0.595200	It makes me feel worried that the doctor might discover a problem during the examition that I didn't know about.
0.142900	I do not feel worried about a visit.
0.452400	I get anxious about my lab results for my condition and also about my weight. 
0.452400	Since I have had numerous medical issues, I do have some anxiety or worry that something may be amiss when i discuss current symptoms or have to get certain blood work done.  I usually, however, keep things under control!
0.785700	I would feel out-of-control.  I would feel depersolized and treated as a body.  I would feel vulnerable.
0.285700	The only thing that really worries me is that they will find something bad, like cancer or something that will be expensive or difficult to treat. And depending on what happens with the ACA, I am also a little worried about what they will notate in my file. 
0.714300	When I visit a Doctor's office, it is because I am already showing symptoms of something that has not gone away on its own. As a result, I am already worried prior to the visit, as if it doesn't go away on its own, it may be serious.
0.452400	THat something will be wrong with me.
0.761900	I'm always worried that what they think is wrong with me is incorrect. I think that it is something worse than what it is.
0.833300	I'm worried they will find something.  I'm worried that the doctor may think less of me because I'm overweight.
0.738100	That the doctor may find something wrong. That I may not be taken seriously. General anxiety and panic due to mental health issues.
0.952400	I do not like to be touched by people, so being examined is extremely stressful to me.  I am also a nervous person in general, so it does not take much to get me worked up.  I tend to be pessimistic, so it is easy for me to assume the worst about health conditions.  I (and members of my family) have been brushed off when we did bring up medical complaints, so I tend to worry whether the doctor will take my complaints seriously.     
0.809500	The possibility of health issues is always a concern. However, I am quite an anxious individual, so just the base process of attending this appointment fills me with an uneasiness and a sense of dread. I feel a lack of confidence and a sense of embarrassment, even seemingly without just cause.
0.357100	Cost of treatment Treating the pain or injury I have would cause me to stop doing something I like to do.
0.761900	That they will discover I have some horrible illness or that I will need some awful treatment. I also just dislike the environment (cold, reeking of disinfectant).
0.547600	Being in that paper gown makes me uncomfortable. You aren't always at your best when you need to visit the doctor. I may have a serious problem or feel very sick.
0.404800	Its the whole scene of making the trip their, sitting in the waiting room, surrounded by strangers and their aliments with my my thoughts that drift off to cooler place I wish to be. 
0.571400	"I have had fairly aggressive responses from professiols when I ask them simple questions. When I ask my healthcare providers questions I either get unsatisfactory answers or outright defiance. It is too easy to offend a medical professiol by ""questioning them"". Studies show that for a therapist their compassion is more highly correlated with their success than their skillset or education. As computers become more capable of diagnosing health problems (and as most doctors just put your symptoms into google these days anyway), I think we will have less autistic doctors that can ace any test and less stress in the doctor's office."
0.285700	Uncertainty about my illness, or the treatment I may need.
0.238100	its usally a long wait when I go to the doctors the waiting makes me anxious and when I have to wait to get results makes me feel worried some times.
0.142900	I have a condition that is called white coat syndrome. When I go to the doctor even though I do not feel different my bp rises. After I settle down I come out normal. I do sometime feel a little bit nervous when getting back blood tests but other than that I look forward to seeing my doctor. 
0.881000	I feel most nervous that they are going to tell me about something that will kill me that I was uware of. 
0.142900	This depends highly on the current health situation. If I had a serious health issue, I'm sure I would feel some anxiety about the diagnosis and treatment. Maybe more so about the costs than anything else. 
0.452400	I feel like they might found something bad. I also think that I may have a bad condition.
0.785700	I worry that I won't be taken seriously. I worry that I won't be able to get what I need. I feel anxious about experiencing prejudice (many healthcare professiols have prejudice against fat patients and transgender patients). I worry about the results of lab tests. 
0.428600	I guess whether or not something will be wrong with me that I'm not aware of. I don't normally think like this though. 
0.547600	"I feel most anxious about the ""what ifs"". What if something were wrong, or something was gong to happen medically. I often get anxious about my interactions with a professiol, I am not a ""people"" person."
0.381000	Honestly the most anxious I get is over getting shots. I know they're important but they trigger a phobia in me and it makes me very uneasy to deal with it. 
0.571400	I don't know what the outcome is going to be.  Is this going to be a serious issue?  Will it be expensive?  Perhaps, I'm also somewhat anxious about whether or not they will be able to tell me what is wrong at all.
0.404800	I always worry that they will look at my former diagnosis and decide or judge me verses taking a look at whats bothering me at the time. for instance, I was self medicating with alcohol, i came in drunk several times, so when i get asked several times if im still drinking in the same visit, its irritating. Are you sure you havent drank this week? its patronizing. 
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, is the possibility that he finds something abnormal during the check up.
0.452400	I worry if the doctor may be right in the diagnosis and I worry that the doctor would prescribe a medication that would eventually harm me in the long term. I feel that the doctor only concern about making her quota for the day and would not give me the full attention i require.
0.690500	i always seem to get bad news. i hate being told or wondering if i am doing things right. everything seem so cold and sterile.
0.619000	I've had so many health problems in the last 10 years that a visit to the Dr. is almost never good news.
0.928600	That my knowledge of my body and my views about medicine and disease will not be respected. That I will be forced into treatments that run counter to my beliefs. That I will be abused and put through unnecessary procedures or tests.
0.738100	I'm more worried they might find something bad that I wasn't aware of. This is more me worrying than anything as it's rare they find anything serious. Most of the time the problem isn't serious and they can treat it. I just kinda hold my breath when I'm at the doctor anyway, you never know if they'll find something you don't know about....
1.000000	I am worried about the cost, about whether or not the staff are friendly, if whatever I am going in there for is going to end up being something worse than I expected. There are a ton of reasons to feel complete and utter anxiety and worry while you're in there. That's why a lot of people don't go. 
0.404800	I am usually worried about the results of a blood test and just making sure my numbers are okay in general.
0.381000	I tend to be anxious in unusual social situations. Being in a small room with another person puts me on edge regardless of the actions of the physician. 
0.142900	I feel most anxious about anomalies showing up in my blood tests and the embarrassment of getting a pap smear.  But in general, I do not get anxious or worried when seeing a doctor.  I see doctor visits as a necessity, and any medical problems must be detected and dealt with head-on.
0.738100	In all honesty, what makes me the most anxious is walking into the doctors office and sitting there alone waiting for my doctor to come. There is nothing more that puts me on edge like that.
0.738100	Nothing
0.642900	I'm just a very anxious person in general, and I have white coat syndrome, so my blood pressure rises when I go to the doctor, which in turn makes the doctors/nurses worried, which makes my anxiety increase. I also get anxious that the doctor will find something wrong with me, which will have a negative impact on my life.
0.285700	I am generally not anxious when I see the doctor. I am rarely sick and just don't have much fear when I go see a doctor. I guess there is always a fear of something being terribly wrong with me but I tend not to think about that. I guess I am more anxious about picking up an illness at the doctor than anything else, like the flu.
0.642900	If the doctors says unpredictable things or some thing bad it scare me to see the doctor.
0.452400	I mainly worry when I am not certain about what is going on with my body. What is causing issues of illness.
0.642900	whether i will get the best solution for me
0.690500	I am most anxious about finding a reason and remedy for any health problems. I become worried about invasive and expensive testing that give no answers. I worry about being overlooked or ignored about my concerns.
0.476200	Wondering what battery of tests or measures may be necessary, whether something unplanned or unnounced will be painful or stressful.
0.142900	Nothing, I love visiting my doctor.
0.642900	Can they be trusted?
0.595200	Just doctor's in general make me nervous no matter how many times I have been. I think they call it white coat syndrome. I am fearful of a scary diagnosis even tho I have never had one before. 
0.357100	It depends on the circumstances. I not usually anxious or worried at all about a routine examition. If I'm there because I'm injured or ill, I might be somewhat worried about my condition or the prognosis.
0.357100	The chance of receiving bad news I suppose. I have cancer in my family and it is always a worry of mine. 
0.571400	I do not have to visit the doctor often enough to have worry.
0.785700	I'm not sure there's anything specific. The whole visit is overwhelming. I'm nervous I won't get to tell them what's wrong. That they will be rushing and not listening to you. If you go for a physical and tell them things that have been wrong with you, you have to worry about insurance because it's no longer a physical. You worry about them overbilling because if you aren't requesting an itemized bill, you know they are.
0.381000	I only worry if I think something is wrong. I visit my doctor to decrease my worry.
0.595200	I'm afraid they will tell me something bad. 
0.976200	The uncertainty of the potential outcome is what worries me most.  That uncertainty stems from a fear that something may be terribly wrong with me. Along with that, there's always the fear that either way, I'm going to have to undergo frightening procedures that may include getting needles (I have a phobia of them).
0.619000	I think the biggest thing is that I always think the worst and assume I will get bad news a lot of times. It takes a lot for me to go to the doctor usually so when I do go I get nervous and anxious. 
0.785700	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel most anxious about having my weight and blood pressure checked, because they are usually higher than recommended. I also feel stupid if I need to ask for clarification if I don't understand something the doctor said. And just being around people in general (in the waiting room, for example) makes me very anxious. I fear judgment and criticism, and also fear possibly becoming ill from sick patients.
0.476200	I feel anxious at time of visitation because I feel sometimes they will give me some negative results about my health.  
0.714300	i hate to go to clinic  the atmosphere makes me sick more
0.333300	Just the unsureness of what could be wrong with me. 
0.785700	That they will press on an issue that I don't feel like looking into or that I don't feel is serious. That they will refuse to continue seeing me if I don't do some kind of testing that I don't want to do. That they will think I'm lying when I say I have no issues. 
0.809500	Cost is always a big factor and then you worry about what they may find and what treatments and/or prescriptions that you will have to take and what side effects could be included. 
0.666700	Just being in a doctor's office makes me anxious. You know you are there because you're not feeling well, but you don't know the exact reason why and you never know what you might be diagnosed with. You also never know if the doctor is going to reprimand you about the way that you handle your health and that can be embarrassing and upsetting. I am a relatively private person and I hate putting myself so out there and that includes telling the doctor private health information.
0.428600	Just the rush rush of it all. I do not really trust that dr's are really listening to what you are saying.
0.309500	I think that what makes me worried the most is that they might  find something really wrong. 
0.666700	The language barrier concerns me most.  What he says and what I think he means are sometimes different.  As an example, they tell me that tests I need to take for an existing condition are preventive; they are not preventive if I already have the condition.  The tests at that stage are diagnostic.  They are more concerned with a patient taking standard tests than treating them for the condition the patient is most worried about. 
0.785700	My family on both my mother's and father's, have histories of terrible diseases as well as cancer. My dad died of cancer at a young age. There is also quite a bit of mental health issues, the cause of my mother's suicide. I've spent a lot of time in hospitals watching people die and just driving by a hospital gives me the chills. I worry because I always expect the worst when it comes to doctor visits.
0.285700	I don't know. Nothing really. If I have a concern that I think something is really bad, I would probably be nervous. If I had no idea what was going on with my health.
0.547600	I think it is usually the possibility of illness or a bad visit and finding out something is wrong.
0.285700	NOT APPLICABLE
0.285700	I do not typically get worried when going to the Dr. Unless it is going to be a painful procedure.
0.595200	I get most upset and worried when it comes to physical examitions because of my own persol views about myself and my body.
0.190500	"Mostly it's finding out something is wrong. Other than that, it's more of ""did I cut my ils, or wash well"", and making sure I don't smell. The exam is just ""there"", and doesn't cause me too much worry."
0.214300	just the thourht of the unknown like getting bad news but not usully that bad of and experience as far as worrying goes
0.571400	There is nothing in particular, it is just a generalized anxiety I get just by going to the doctor. It is just an uneasiness that I get just being there. 
0.809500	I am always worried about bad news. My mind always goes to thinking that any results will come back bad. I also fear being told I will have to come back for more testing.
0.571400	Because of how people can't do things with how the doctor's office and the results
0.523800	Uncomfortable questions. And also the dread that he will find something wrong with me. 
0.333300	The only thing that makes me nervous is when they take blood because I hate needles.  I also have in the back of my mind the notion that the blood might come back with something negative that might negatively affect my life.
0.238100	I am always anxious about my blood work.   However, nothing ever turns up bad so that is a relief.  
0.619000	I get nervous because a lot of people in my family have had cancer, I've been pretty healthy my whole life but I'm afraid my luck will run out and I'll get it too.
0.166700	Mostly I am worried about unseen or unknown health issues that might show up in an examition. If I am unsure what caused the problem that brought me to the doctor's office, I will usually have some sort of concern or worry. If I have a general understanding or notion as to what is wrong with me such as a flu, I am typically not too worried at all. 
0.500000	Don't have any complications or disorder. Still anxious about needles since I was little.
0.452400	I usually get my blood drawn when I see my doctor. He does it as a good habit, I suppose. I'm terrified of needles.
0.714300	My blood pressure is always high and it is even higher when I go to the doctor's office.  I am always anxious because I'm expecting it to be high.
0.500000	I worry that my doctor might tell something bad about my health.
0.357100	I am most anxious of being called out because I haven't kept to a low saturated diet as much as the doctor recommended.  I hate admitting I haven't followed instructions.
0.714300	I worried about what the diagnosis the doctor will tell me.  Will it require surgery, how long the recovery period will be if surgery is required, is it a termil illness, or a decline in my mental faculties?
0.571400	I never know if something is wrong that I don't know about or if the doctor will find something that I didn't know was wrong. 
0.571400	"I call the chair that I sit in closest to the doctor the ""hot seat"".  :o)  I am always a little nervous going to the doctor.  I wonder if what I am going in for might be something silly and I am making a big deal about a small thing.  Also I worry that they won't find whatever is going on with me and after testing they don't find anything.  I feel a little foolish after that."
0.142900	Sometimes I may feel that way but it is not because of the actual visit is. It is more because I have to be there in the first place, meaning something is really going on with me and I am anxious to find out what it is.
0.285700	I really don't feel nervous visiting.  If it's a check up I feel pretty good about it and don't really worry about what they might fine (I can't change it anyway and would rather know).  I think the only thing I don't like is when they take blood.  Sometimes it goes smooth and other times it's painful as they have to restick me several times.  Other than that it's all good.
0.690500	I haven't had a male doctor since I was a child.  Now I have a male doctor and I feel very uncomfortable with him.  I think that if I had either a female physician or a male physician who was more concerned and caring I would not have these feelings.
0.642900	Even though I am relatively healthy and have no family history of major medical conditions, there is always the chance that something can go wrong. I wouldn't say I am extremely nervous when visiting my doctor but I am a bit anxious. 
0.904800	I don't know what could be wrong with me; the mystery bothers me. I would love to have straight answers at all times.
0.904800	I'm usually worried that I will get bad news. I get anxious that they will tell me something is very wrong. Or if I don't know the doctor I get scared that they won't treat me right. 
0.666700	I am usually anxious or worried because I fear that something will be wrong with me.  I worry that I will find that I have diabetes or some other bad news.  
0.642900	That i am wasting my time and not going to get the help i need to fix or understand my problems. Most of my problems are not real bad just yet but they are problems i want to understand before they become major issues.
0.785700	The unknown.  I never have been comfortable with doctors and the older I have gotten, the less I trust doctors, especially since the ovomitdon;tcare tax went into effect and we are refused treatment once we reach the age that we cannot work and support the correct number of career welfare families.  
0.690500	The results of tests.  That can mean blood work or various other tests.  I also had unprotected sex which made me nervous waiting for the test results for that.
0.238100	I'm often worried that the solution to my problem will be complicated or very time-consuming/expensive.
0.166700	I'm not typically worried or anxious when I visit a doctor's office.
0.952400	I am most worried that he will neglect to find the source of the problem, and I will die due to an error that was easily preventable with a little care for his job. I think they have no consequences for patient deaths, so they do not care if they miss things that will save lives. They do not care for their patients anymore, they just milk them for their sheckles.
0.142900	I just have no faith in any of them and feel I'm going to have to visit at least one more time permitting to get a second opinion and they always say it's something else so then you have to figure out which is correct which means a third opinion or simply suffering until your body kicks the ailment itself.
0.404800	Most my symptoms are things that I worry about, and not the doctor herself. I am fearful that some of the pains I am having are serious medical conditions.
0.523800	I imagine it would be the uncertainty.  it is also uncomfortable.  why are you even asking this question?  you have to know the answer.
0.190500	I'm not worried just cautious and aware..educated... 
0.166700	I worry about my doctor's age and how long he is going to remain in practice since he is well aged. I also worry about some of the staff at the office and how many have left over the years. Just general white coat anxiety is what makes me feel most anxious, I have always had that and always will.
0.571400	I'm passed the point where I receive good news at the doctor
0.261900	Just the concern that something may be worse.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious at all at a doctors office. I feel like I'm doing things that I should probably do more often, but I don't because of fincial reasons.
0.619000	Unless it for just a regular check up I'm there for a reason which I need help with I'm worried. If I'm feeling pain especially in abdomen I'm especially worried it might be something serious like cancer.
0.714300	I worry that the doctor will find a health problem I am not already aware of. I worry that the doctor will get short if I ask too many questions. I worry that the doctor is so attuned to conventiol options that he won't think broadly about new possibilities to address conditions with less side effects and more benefits.
0.500000	I am worried that something might be wrong. I don't usually go to the doctor so when I do, its because of some pain or problem so I am anxious that it is very serious
0.881000	I always feel like they will find something else wrong with me, I take enough meds now
0.571400	Certainly there's some anxiety or dread in going to the doctor. Whether it's just an exam or you're going for a specific purpose, there's always some uncertainty about what the doctor will say. It could be everything's ok or you have some serious medical problems. That uncertainty makes it tural to be anxious.
0.690500	If the doctor will sound harsh or criticize me.  If the doctor will ignore or discredit what I say.  If I end up having a really bad health problem.
0.642900	Usually it's things like how bad my cholesterol is, maybe anxious on things that might be suggested by my doctor...and definitely not looking forward to full (yearly) or prostate examition.
0.166700	The only thing I fear is the wait. This makes me anxious because I do not like to waste time. Sometimes this can be the worst part of the doctor visit.
0.142900	getting blood drawn is what makes me the most anxious. when i get blood drawn i always pass out.
0.285700	It'll sound odd, but okay. It's extremely rare for me to catch a cold, but I always feel a little anxious about the potential germs. The main reason getting sick bothers me is that it'll get in the way of my weight training (and I happen to be a training stimulus addict). Ironically enough, nothing else bothers me...I maintain a single digit body fat percentage virtually year-round, and my doctor often comes to me for fitness advice ;-)
0.714300	From the smell when I hit the door until I escape, I am anxious about everything. I trust them to a point but am always wondering what they aren't telling me which isn't really fair to my current doc because she is very thorough and takes more time than any other doc has ever spent with me. My blood pressure always skyrockets although it never is away from medical facilities but filly my current doc figured this out. I expect bad things to happen because of past experiences.
0.642900	The unknown of what the doctor will say. You are always worried that the doctor will find something unexpected. 
0.738100	It is just an uncomfortable feeling. I don't think anyone looks forward to going to the doctor.
0.500000	I have high blood pressure. I'm always anxious about have my blood pressure tested because it varies so much and it is usually high when I go to the doctor's office because I have walked to get there. Sometimes it bothers me because the nurses get a high reading and are overly concerned. If the doctor takes the blood pressure later it's usually lower, but the nurses don't seem to understand that.
0.761900	I just worry they will find some major health issue wrong with me. 
0.500000	Hoping my chronic health conditions are not gettimg worse. Nervous about test results. Trying to be optimistic.
0.428600	the wait and being around other people who could be sick 
0.738100	What makes me most anxious about a doctor visit is two-fold: the thought of finding out something dreadful is wrong OR that nothing is wrong and I look the fool. 
0.285700	I really don't feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor.  The only issue I have is that I had a really bad experience with a doctor in the same practice and I don't really like to see him.  If I do, I just pretend that he isn't there. It is so worth it to see our current doctor that I will deal with seeing the other doctor for a minute or so when we are walking to the exam room.
0.809500	What worries me most is thinking of  all the things the doctor might find. It's stressful to think you may have some disease or cancer and the doctor is about to change your life forever.
0.333300	I always wonder if they will find something else wrong, besides the problem that I am there for.  I usually get a little anxious because I know that I have waited too long before going to see the doctor.
0.428600	They might find major health problems 
0.500000	When I visit my doctor for my examitions I am always anxious about m results. I always think that something might go wrong and this makes me nervous.
0.690500	Finding out the cause of any medical issues I am contending with. 
0.642900	I feel anxious about going to the doctor at any time.  I am not a fan.  I can become a little worried about the idea of tests or anything out of the ordiry.
0.357100	I feel worried, because I am not sure I get the best medical advice. Some anxiety comes from realization that my doctor doesn't incentives to give me his utmost attention.
0.642900	I worry that I wont cover all the things I feel like I should talk to the doctor about in order for them to give me proper medical care and that the reason I wont is because I worry they will think I'm some kind of hypochondriac (although I see a doctor less than once a year, sometimes if you have a lot of concerns when you see them they seem to become pretty tired and dismissive as the exam proceeds.)
0.357100	i get the white coat syndome when they take my bp it always goes way up and scares me
0.619000	You know when you don't feel well or are in pain, but there are tests and measurements that can locate possible diseases or health issues that I may not even be aware of.  I'm also not very comfortable being ked, so that's very nerve wracking.
0.381000	They advise me on weight loss as if it can be done over night or its really easy.
0.547600	In my current situation, the cost is my biggest concern. Otherwise, I don't really have issues with seeing the doctor. There's only the slightest worry about what might be wrong with me.
0.238100	The potential for a negative visit usually is what bothers me the most. If I've never been to a particular doctor's office, their demeanor mostly gives me cause for worry.
0.761900	Mostly I worry about my condition and how it will affect me. I also get nervous around doctors in general, because usually when you have to see a doctor, you won't be getting good news. So I'm usually already feeling a bit anxious before I even see the doctor.
0.714300	Thoughts that there is no point to visit the doctor, I just spend time and money without any results.
0.333300	My worries at the doctor are usually less about the actual meeting with the doctor than surrounding matters like cost and health insurance. I am sometimes concerned about prescription side effects or misdiagnosis, but am willing enough to accept my doctor's recommendations that it doesn't bother me.
0.142900	I sometimes think about how much the visit to the doctor will cost me. I think of it more as an annoyance than I'm being taken advantage of.
0.142900	I am anxious to have the exam over with but worried that maybe the results will not be good.
0.523800	Now that I am 64 I cannot help but worry about what the doctor may find; if there is some condition or clue that I am not even aware about, but may lead me down a serious path of health treatments and expenses. I think I am actually more worried about the possible fincial consequences than the physical discomfort.
0.238100	I'm a anxious person in general. But when I go to the doctor am a little more anxious I think just because I'm afraid she might find something bad, like cancer.
0.738100	The hope that nothing bad comes out of the exam.  I go to an exam if I think something might need to be checked, or for bloodwork ect.  Its always a worry that something will maybe be wrong.  
0.428600	Not knowing if everything's gon be okay or if there's some issue the doctor might discover that I didn't know about.
0.595200	Anxious about getting old and sick.
0.952400	The thing I worry about most when seeing my doctor is potentially finding out that I have a serious problem and will need surgery. Just the thought of surgery terrifies me!
0.666700	I do feel anxious at times that they won't know what is wrong with me or it will cost a lot of money to heal me.
0.761900	The idea of receiving bad health news or finding out that there was something extremely wrong with me or my health.
0.238100	The potential for being diagnosed with something serious, I suppose.
0.452400	Mostly I worry if my health is improving or backsliding. I have a silly worry that he will find some horrible disease or something. I mean, not really, but kind of if that makes sense. I also don't like getting shots. Or the backside exam.
0.928600	The attention of the doctors
0.142900	Not knowing what the doctor will tell me. Uncertainty of the situation.
0.523800	Not really about the doctor but more about what I might find out and how much it will cost.
0.785700	You never know if your next physical could be the one that you find out that you have cancer or some other life-crippling ailment.
0.142900	I worry that they might find something that I didn't know about and it is very serious.
0.452400	my doctor takes hours to come into the office to see me. that makes me really anxious because sometimes i have other things to do that day. also, i just met him so i get anxious about describing all my issues to him.
0.142900	I dont get anxious or worried when visiting a dr office.  There is literally no point in adding stress.
0.714300	Unless I am having a routine visit then there is always a chance that I could have a serious problem. Even when having a routine visit there is that chance, but it is more worrisome when the problem is not something you have normally dealt with. In my case I have a condition that will generally get worse as I age and I am anxious because I may get information that I have gotten worse instead of staying the same. 
0.547600	I feel most anxious or worried at a doctors office wondering if they will listen without being brushed off or ridiculed. They tend to be dismissive when realizing I am not able to tolerate medicine, and rather than researching to find the root cause I often feel brushed off or abandoned. I get anxious or worried because I'm obviously visiting the office for a valid reason and wish they would take a moment and try to help find or recommend an altertive solution. 
0.214300	What makes me most anxious is now knowing what the doctor might find, that is medically wrong with me, during the office visit.
0.476200	Diabetes runs in my family.  I want to make sure that I never get that disease ever in my life. I'm always anxious at the thought of the doctor telling me that I have diabetes whenever I come in. 
0.642900	I feel like I am not going to remember to share all my concerns or that if I bring them up the doctor will think they are stupid. My husband recently brought up concerns I had over a procedure that he needed done and he said the doctor literally said the concern was stupid. 
0.142900	I don't typically feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office.  I know my body and my health very well.  Visits to the doctor's office, up to this point in my life, have been relatively event free.
0.595200	I feel anxious about the exam itself and not speaking well. I get nervous and shy to talk to anyone I do not know well and sometimes stumble over my words. I also get worried over what the prognosis will be. 
0.142900	That I might have to get blood drawn which doesn't hurt it's just an annoying process.
0.309500	Being in a doctors office. 
0.190500	I will feel worried if i have some health issue since long and will be waiting for the reports from the doctor.
0.619000	Just the thought that something serious could be wrong.  The thought I might catch something from the other sick people.  That I might have to have some kind of treatment.  That I might have to have a shot.
0.404800	It is uncomfortable to have someone examine my body, that is essentially a stranger, so intimately . It is uncomfortable no matter how often it occurs.
0.738100	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fear of the unknown. Even if I am at the doctors for something minor routine test can show something worse.
0.714300	The unknown of what they might find from running test.
0.476200	just what to expect from a check up.Just thinking what if they find something wrong with me.
0.952400	I feel anxious because I am afraid he will find something wrong or he will want to send me somewhere for tests I do not want
0.857100	I'm worried that they will find something wrong with me. I hold my breath until they tell me everything is okay.
0.285700	I feel most anxious or worried because I felt feared.
0.500000	I don't know, really. I'm not scared, just nervous. 
0.547600	 Usually the thought that he might find something that is an illness or has the potential to be bad,  like a tumor or whatnot. It's not so much the examition itself as it is the potential negative outcome of my labs being bad, etc.
0.500000	I am most anxious about the results. I am scared that they will find a disease or condition that will affect my life. I am also anxious about how the doctor will handle my care. Third, I am anxious because I am self-conscious about my body.
0.857100	I'm not sure I can change what will happen. I really don't need to know the answer to many questions I can't afford to treat in the way I would need to do. most problems go away if you can not worry about them long enough.
0.666700	I am always worried that the doctor will discover something that could lead to something complicated and unwanted.
1.000000	When I go to the doctor and they take a long time to tell me what's going on. I also gets worried when I'm not sure about what my problem is.
0.261900	I just always feel a little uneasy and nervous waiting on a diagnosis. The feeling of uncertainty is always a bit unsettling. I try my best to not let it bother me to much.
0.238100	It just makes me anxious having to be examined.  I don't have a good reason.  It feels kind of intrusive.
0.976200	The whole thing is anxiety producing and nerve-wracking. One of the primary contributors to these negative feelings involves my persol knowledge of how physicians frequently behave, think, and act i.e. their utter lack of genuine care or concern for patients, their tendency to essentially ignore patients and just drone on about whatever they would like to, and their tendency to behave like patients are a burden and infringing on their time. 
0.619000	the uncertain of your health or finding some bad news about you
0.857100	I'm worried that they won't look for what is wrong with me and think it is all in my head. I'm scared they might find something bad wrong with me and I'm terrified of having painful procedures and tests done. 
0.500000	I just don't like waiting. I am in pretty good health so I'm not really worried that something terrible is going to turn up. I am always a bit anxious to find out my weight since I have struggled with it in the past. 
0.881000	Examitions require a level of persol interaction that I am very uncomfortable with. I usually only go when I am sick so I am already worried. 
0.619000	I feel anxious or worried the most when I am sick and go to the doctors. I feel like I may receive some bad news sometimes. It's just an atmosphere where you are not sure if everything will be okay. But I trust my doctor so I am not entirely anxious. 
0.142900	Nothing really.  I like my nurse practitioner and feel like I don't mind going to the doctor's office when needed. 
0.428600	"The lack of concern for my health commonly demonstrated by the doctor. The assumption that I am an ignorant person without the capacity to understand what is being said to me. (That said, having done technical support for years, I can understand that attitude. ""My computer has a big blue screen that says I done somethin' illegal, but I didn't! It's all paid for, legal."" Yes, this is a real event.)"
0.333300	Just the fact that I have to go the doctor at all. I have been sick for a while so it just makes me nervous to be there at all, and a little anxious but I know I feel a bit better now, so it is getting better with the axiety.
0.619000	Often times it's the possibility of having to argue with them about what would be a better treatment for ME. There are certain meds that just aren't necessary, and I hate that I have to go in with the mindset of having to be my own advocate and ready for mild confrontation. A doctor should have my best interest in mind and not just what is easy or done out of habit for them. I also worry I won't be listened to when I try to do my due diligence to list ALL symptoms pertaining to whatever is ailing me. 
0.547600	usually what they may or may not find. You never know what problems you could have until you get an examition. I usually trust their skills and judgment and that they'll do their job well though. 
0.904800	I worry they will perform a painful procedure.  I worry they will recommend that I have a painful procedure.  I am anxious about rather or not they will listen to my needs, concerns and rather or not they will spend enough time with me.
0.381000	I don't like being poked and prodded, disrobed, made to wait long periods of time in the exam room.
0.761900	I get anxious or worried because I always expect something bad to come out of the situation.  I'm always thinking something more serious is going on than really is. 
0.690500	I get worried that I will have to get shots. I've had a phobia of them for a while
0.690500	Usually any procedure that involves the doctor inspecting private areas makes me worried.  I don't feel comfortable with that at all.
0.381000	I think it is just the fact of the unknown. Everyone comes across health issues at some point in their life and im just nervous waiting for mine. Worrying that my blood test will come back abnormal or the doctor will hear something in my lungs or see a lump somewhere. 
0.761900	I don't know the person and I feel vulnerable. I don't like talking to stranger or having strangers touch me.
0.523800	I am very paranoid about my health. The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried is me thinking about what could be wrong and what the doctor will tell me. I am always afraid he is going to give me horrible news.
0.881000	If there Is something wrong with my health. If I have to take any long term medication. The process of getting better if there is an illness.
0.666700	I am not sure why I feel like this. It is a general feeling that I have always had. Probably mostly the smell and the idea that I will be in pain ( a shot or a pap smear).  And then recently just frustrated that the doctor will treat me like my situation is stupid.
0.690500	The possibility of finding something life threatening. 
0.238100	I have no problem visiting the doctor's office. Other than the occasiol...I have absolutely no bedside manner doctor, I find doctors very accommodating. I however, hate Pap smears. Unless you've had one you can't possibly understand. So...no problems with going for physical other than pap and a small aversion to needles.
0.809500	I am most worried about finding out bad news about my health when visiting the doctor. More than that I worry about any treatment I may need. I worry about any physical pain I might have to endure and how I will pay for it. Since I can't afford it and my insurance isn't adequate, I worry because I know I probably won't receive proper treatment. 
0.142900	I am not anxious or worried about doctor's visit, but concern about time I don't like the waiting
0.166700	I am made most anxious by having to bare my body during physical examitions. A doctor has never made me feel uncomfortable about this...I just am.
0.642900	I just worry the possibility that they find something wrong with me. I'm never worried about the doctor doing anything wrong or making mistakes. I don't have the healthiest lifestyle so I expect bad news when I visit the doctor.
0.642900	The diagnosis. I sometimes already have some idea or thought about why I feel bad and I'm afraid that the doctor's diagnostic confirm my suspicions.
0.142900	I don't get anxious about visiting the doctor in the same way that I don't get anxious when shopping for groceries or getting an oil change.
0.714300	I am just always worried they'll find something crazy bad with my health.
0.571400	I feel that the doctor might find something that is bad like a health condition or a disease that I have recently developed.
0.142900	i don't like waiting for results especially if it was for something that might be serious. 
0.690500	"Feeling as though the physician doesn't have the time to ""deal"" with you.  Questions not answered, followup not proper.  "
0.809500	I worry that something could be found to be wrong with my heart. Sometimes my blood pressure is higher than it should be when they test it. I worry that the doctor will think I am faking the physical pain and anxiety I feel so that I can get drugs from it.
0.547600	I feel anxious because I am a person that is reserved. I am quiet so it is hard to open up to somebody. 
0.857100	Oftentimes, the silence that hangs in the air from other patients. 
0.857100	I think lack of trust is a big issue. I'm also squeamish about needles and other procedures. Also, bad memories about my parents' medical treatment.
0.738100	The longer i wait, the more anxious i become. As i become more stressed anxiety builds. The waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me to become even more stressed.
0.761900	I'm not sure if I know.  It seems to be an automatic reaction.  It may be in part that I don't want to be told that I need to make major changes in my lifestyle.
0.952400	Number one is that they will find something wrong even if I am there to treat something minor.  I will be nervous and worried and then it will most likely be nothing, a mistake.  Or the treatment will do nothing for me.
0.285700	Just the activity of going to visit a doctor for them to possibly tell you something about your body you may not know. The experience in and of itself is a little bit nerve wracking.
0.333300	My biggest fear would be a diagnosis which revealed some serious medical condition which I was uware of.
0.190500	Mostly the attitude of the doctors and their staff.  It makes me a bit worried if the staff is not professiol in handling the appointments and/or paperwork.  
0.452400	Unless it's for a regular check-up, I'm at the doctor's office because I''m either injured or ill. My condition would make me a bit anxious. There is also the small chance that the doctor might discover something serious that I was not already aware of. 
0.619000	I am afraid I will get bad news.
0.761900	That they will find something wrong with me that is very harmful and that would be life changing. Today going to get checked by a doctor with all the things that can go wrong is a very stressful thing.
0.571400	I'm worried about the readings of my vitals that the nurse takes. Those are generally the best way to tell how I'm doing. By the time the doctor comes in, I'm more apprehensive at what the numbers are more than I'm worried about him as a person or physician. 
0.857100	When I sense that the doctor has their own agenda rather than responding to the patient in front of them, it makes me very anxious. When the doctor exhibits arrogant behavior or seems disrespectful, I worry that they won't really listen to me or will discount what I have to tell them. When a doctor seems to assume that every patient is displaying drug-seeking behavior, I worry that they aren't really listening and that I will not get the right treatment.
0.523800	Mainly just the fear of a bad diagnosis. 
0.476200	Its just a very nerve wracking experience, if you don't go to the doctor that often like me, you just never know what illness might pop up.
0.285700	The only thing that worries me is if I am sick, and I am worried that the doctor will have bad news as to the sickness.  I worry that the cure for the ailment would be traumatic or painful; like if I needed surgery.
0.238100	Not knowing what the results of tests or an examition might be. It makes me a little nervous,not knowing what to expect.
0.571400	The thing that worries me the most is that there will be costs I'm not aware of to the visit. We are on a very fixed income and a lot of times there are additiol fees tacked onto bills that I wasn't expecting. Sometimes it's because I asked a question, which is frustrating.
0.333300	As I get older, I recognize that my body is aging as well. As the body ages, it tends to degrade. What makes me anxious is if he finds something wrong and wants me to go see other doctors or have tests performed. I don't want to spend the time having to do that.
0.928600	The idea that I might have something else to add to the pile of illnesses I have. Or that with my Sjogren's since I'm more likely to get lymphoma will it show up, especially since cancer runs in my family.
0.809500	When I visit a doctor's office, my biggest fer or worry is a negative diagnosis. It is basically the fear of the unknown or the uncertainty of it. 
0.381000	We all want to avoid bad news and pain
0.428600	"The only time I might feel anxious or worried with visiting my doctor would be, the not ""Knowing"" what's wrong. Not wanting to hear any dreadful news."
0.142900	I only get anxious sometimes in the waiting room because I get social anxiety. 
0.476200	I worry that I may have underestimated the seriosness of my condition. There is usually also the worry that the doctor might find something wrong with me that I did not even suspect.
0.642900	It worries me that my physician will give me bad news about my health. 
0.547600	I am a very nervous person. When I have a doctors appointment I am very antsy and high strung. I fear my diagnosis will one day  be cancer.
0.619000	I just don't like medical visits. You're vulnerable and not in control.
0.714300	"I have to be KED! Well, not exactly. The gown is open in the back though, making me feel exposed and vulnerable. I don't want to turn my head and cough while he checks out my ball sac. Sh*t, he's looking down there a bit too long. Is he gay? Oh, no, here come the latex gloves. ""Bend over,"" he says. "
0.642900	I have a fear across the boards with doctors and dentists. Im afraid of bad news such as cancer or the likes. I think finding out the bad news would make what ever it is get worse faster. I also worry that i will be looked down on, due to weight. Although it hasn't been the case, its still in my head.
0.857100	"I worry that the doctor might prescribe me medicines just because I went in for a consultation. In other words, the doctor could have very well known that the medicines are just a temporary solution and that my illness would have healed on its own, given some time and rest. Instead of saying ""Go take rest"", he would be forced to prescribe medicines just because he is a doctor! I am not scared of injections. However, I become uneasy and anxious of intrusive procedures like inserting swabs into your nose, throat, ears etc. I am anxious that the doctor might be a racist and would harm me in some way or the other based on my appearance or ethnicity."
0.761900	The number one reason for anxiety when going to a doctor is the cost. I fear they are going to recommend something I can not afford.Or find some form of cancer or something.
0.595200	I am worried about what might be wrong with me.  I worry that it might be really serious.
0.761900	I am usually worried that he will discover something that is drastically wrong with my health.
0.547600	What makes me feel the most concerned about visiting a doctor's office is that they likely don't know what to do, but will gladly try a few things that will end up costing way too much. A person is lucky if they don't end up feeling worse, being told there's nothing wrong, and/or walking away having to take a bunch of expensive pills. No, thank you.
0.142900	"I don't like it when the physician doesn't know what is wrong and has to refer me to a specialist. For example, I asked my physician ""Why can't you just do the biopsy?""  She said she didn't have the resources in the office.  It makes me very anxious when I have to make an appointment with another physician and wait while I don't know what is wrong.  This has happened to me in the last year.  Then for the BIGGEST thing that makes me anxious is worrying if my insurance, UHC, is going to try to pull some nonsense to get out of paying for something.  They actually did this, they made every nonsensical excuse not to pay the physician for the biopsy.  The physician's office eventually wrote off the expense, but that is not fair to them.  SO, my insurance trying to get out of paying is what makes me most anxious.  "
0.476200	I am always concerned when I go to a doctor appoint even if it is just for a check-up.  I am not sure why I get so nervous.
0.833300	I worry that something is seriously wrong.
0.619000	I am anxious when my mother is there with me. She will ask questions and sometimes , when the physician asks me a question, she will pop in with her input before I speak.
0.381000	I'm frequently worried that I won't be able to correctly explain my problem, or mess it up so that he won't fully believe me. It's also worrisome that doctors frequently prescribe things that you know isn't what you need.
0.619000	I guess, just the possibility that something could be wrong, or that the doctor will try to steer me down a path I don't totally agree with. However, it's best to address any issue asap. 
0.381000	The thing that makes me feel most anxious and worried is getting blood drawn. I also get nervous when I have to get a shot. Also, pap smears.
0.142900	Just waiting for test results for days instead of getting them the same day of 
0.142900	None so far as I have been taking care of my health on my own. My routine medical checkup has been good and when I do need to see my physician periodically it was more on getting the flu shots or some mild illness.
0.333300	when its a dental checkup i feel anxious.
0.523800	 One never  knows the outcome .. the potential is there for all  kinds of problems.
0.261900	if I have an extreme illness and it may be caught too late
0.904800	I definitely get anxious when I visit the doctors because I feel like they will find something serious.  I tend to jump to the worst conclusion when a test result comes back and when I am asked to come in again.  I get really nervous/worried when I have to wait for those results because I often go into a rabbit hole of reading things on WebMD and other sources to find out more.  Knowing that these visits are to prevent illness from happening or help cure them only eases these worries a little. 
0.428600	Finding out what is wrong with me. Or having him find something new that is devastating. I worry about what the diagnosis might be.
0.785700	I feel most anxious or worried about any possible negative diagnosis or treatments that might be advised to take (especially if invasive). Just the initial feeling of not knowing what is going on or what the problem is is already enough to cause a general feeling of anxiety. Some testing (and not just treatments) are also worrisome (fear of needles... I go through it, but I still hate any type of needles/pin pricks, etc.).
0.142900	Whether I need to be here.  Whether they can help me.  Whether this is a good value for my money.
0.523800	I am worried when the time to know the results of tests. I am worried whether my conditions are getting better, dosages of medicines are right for me in the past three months, when I may proceed for reproduction, ... etc.
0.428600	I am most anxious or worried because of the possibility of finding something medical problem with my health
0.833300	I always think something will be wrong. I think they won't take me serious.
0.500000	I'm always anxious because I go when I have a problem, not just to visit.
0.714300	In the back or my mind there is always that idea that I could have some life altering disease that the Doctor will discover.  Because of my family history, I have a fear that I will develop some sort of cancer, and he'll find it, and tell me I'm termil. 
0.142900	The needle if i have to get a shot!

0.928600	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing what the doctor may or may not find. Even if I'm feeling fine and believe that I'm healthy, you just never know. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac, so in the back of my mind, I think I'm always think there couldbe something wrong. 
0.333300	If I know I have to get blood drawn I will get very nervous and have a panic attack, I do not like needles and that makes me anxious, otherwise I never have many issues while visiting the doctors office.
0.619000	Just the unknown of what is going to happen.  No one wants to get shots or have to draw blood, or find out something looks strange on you.  Those things would make anyone anxious and nervous.
0.142900	I feel that I will receive false or very bad news from my doctor. I have seen doctors give patients wrong information which led to worsened health. 
0.571400	I have anxiety so just going to meet with someone I do not know well in a public place automatically causes me to feel anxious and worried. Couple that with it relating to my health it is more severe.
0.428600	I do not experience anxiety ot worry very much about going to the doctor.  For me, it is more worrying when I can do it between work, kids, homelife, etc.
1.000000	i feel like the doctors are not being honest with me and saying that I am not healthy just so they can prescribe me a bunch of baloney. I have been depressed and very anxious for a while and wanted to bring it up to the doctor but feared they would force me to take pills or force medication for the sake of them gaining money rather than helping me which makes me step back and not want to visit the doctor unless I absolutely have to. 
0.142900	The unknown of what the answer will be. I've had some pretty serious health issues happen and there are chances of reoccurrence. 
0.714300	As I get older and feel more aches and pains I'm worried that he'll find a tumor or some organ failure or some bone turning to dust or some incurable disease.
0.595200	I get anxious sometimes because you never know what is going to found or if something could go wrong. It is not a guarantee that everything will be checked to be fine.
0.428600	I think that there may be some hidden cost and it becomes an unattainable thing for me to get. It could be something worse.
0.309500	I sometimes get nervous about talking about an embarrassing symptom that I might be experiencing, or I get worried that an serious illness might be diagnosed in tests. 
0.142900	Mostly I'm anxious if something is wrong with me and I don't know what it is. If I'm waiting for test results or something, the not knowing is the worst part of it. Other than that, I don't really feel anxious
0.309500	Just being there is sometimes unsettling. It is hard to keep bad thoughts out when you are surrounded by sick people and the smell of a doctor's office. However, I know that my health is separate from others, so I try to keep the bad thoughts out by focusing on myself first. I get a little uneasy when waiting for test results or after an exam, but I know that I can get over it quickly.
0.309500	My greatest fear is that they will not listen or take serious my myriad of chronic and acute illnesses. They seem to often deal with my main issue that I came in for, but don't want to give me the time to deal with the other smaller yet still importan reasons I came in.
0.690500	Just not knowing what exactly is wrong with me is scary. If i go in knowing oh it's just a sore throat or the cold or something isn't that big of a deal. but if i'm going in for a blood test or something like that, it gets a little scary.
0.333300	Whenever I am worried about visiting a doctor it is due to what I am in there for. I am worried something could be wrong with me and it will be a long and expensive process if something is considerably wrong with me. 
0.571400	i am anxious to talk about what is going on with me and im anxious to find out if something new is wrong with me
0.357100	Sometimes I feel anxious or nervous when I'm getting a physical exam by a physician because I'm worried they will find something wrong. 
0.142900	Nothing. I don't worry about it. I don't think anyone really does. It's such a normal part of people's lives like putting gas in a car
0.881000	Like I ALREADY wrote, I don't like waiting.  I want to get crappy situations done with as soon as possible so I'm not sitting around dreading and thinking about the worst case scenario.
0.142900	I actually never get anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. The doctor is there to make sure I am well. There is no hidden motive involved. They provide a service and I am generally alright with the service I personally receive. 
0.642900	When I've read online about symptoms. I always expect the worst and then I worry that the Doctor will confirm what I read.
0.285700	I get most worried about the doctor not being able to find a diagnosis for what is wrong with me. I have had some health problems in the past that I have had a hard time finding a diagnosis for. This means more waiting and more doctor's visits in the future.
0.500000	Having to wait a long time. This is a waste of my life.  Doctors seem to overbook their appointments.
0.285700	I was anxious about the cost.  I am not anxious about the actual visit itself or about my doctor. I recently lost health coverage through my employer so the cost is the source of all my anxiety when it comes to the doctor.
0.809500	I am worried about getting bad news.  I also worry about being embarrassed or feeling awkward.  Usually it is the fear of bad news that worries me the most.
0.142900	Just the waiting process. i do not like to be in a room full of strangers waiting to be seen by a doctor. Other than that, i am completely comfortable with it and do not have any problems at all. 
0.285700	If I am having symptoms that I don't understand, or if I haven't been to the doctor in over a year, I sometimes afraid of what I will find out. It's nothing big, because other than diabetes, nothing really bad has happened to me.
0.285700	I think getting a bad dianosis is probably the worst part about going to the doctor and also what keeps me from going to the doctor is that fear that something will not be good
0.476200	I feel anxious or worried because I feel like I can predict what they are going to say. They are going to talk about how I need to lose 20 pounds and they will ask me questions about my lifestyle and recommend ways to lose weight.  It is a sensitive topic for me and I just don't want to talk about it, let alone with a stranger.
0.571400	I feel most anxious about the fact that there may be something wrong with me that I have not noticed or realized yet and that can lead me to be concerned. 
0.690500	I've always been anxious when going to the doctor's office but it has nothing to do with my doctors or their staff. I'm always concerned that some small ailment will end up being a larger issue. I've also had family members diagnosed with serious illnesses, so I worry that my time will be up at some point.
0.666700	I am not a social person, so I have some difficulty speaking about my problems and issues. I am also worried about what the doctor may have to say about my health. 
0.285700	my psa count as it is an indication of cancer. thankfully mine is normal and has been everytime taken. but it is the test i worry most about though i think my dr is more worried about bp
0.833300	I am an anxious person in general, and medical stuff makes me especially anxious. I think my fear is that the doctor will tell me that I have a serious health problem that I didn't know I had. I worry a lot about those types of things.
0.809500	What makes me most anxious is the fear that my doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I also fear many of the procedures, as well as just interacting with medical people in general. The latter comes with me just having an avoidant personality disorder.
0.785700	That they'll find something wrong with me or something like that or tests will come back positive....
0.357100	I am more worried about getting the news than I am after I have received the news and know how to take care of the situation.
0.309500	I just don't like being at the doctors.  I always remember what happened with the Tuskegee men's study and I'm worried about how doctors can abuse their power.
0.333300	I'm a pretty calm person and I don't get too nervous - but when at the doctor's for a problem I do sometimes have in the back of my head the idea that I might be really sick, or he might find a problem, or I might hear difficult news.  So I get a little uneasy and uncomfortable sometimes due to the unknown but not too bad.
0.642900	I just get anxious that something could be wrong with me that I dont know about. You never know what your bloodwork will come back saying
0.547600	I really get nervous about multiple things such as giving blood or other tests that I have not experienced. I can say I am kinda a baby when it comes to tests and such that doctors may do. This may stem from the fact I have not been to the hospital before for anything serious
0.214300	Mainly Iâm concerned about spending too much time in the waiting room around people who have a contagious illness. 
0.857100	i think it's the fear of finding out you have some sort of illness / disease that you weren't aware of before. i am especially nervous about blood test results
0.690500	I just generally don't like interacting with people on a very personal level.  I don't like to be touched, I like to be private.  Getting undressed in front of a stranger in a strange place and having them poke and prod and examine me asking personal questions is semi traumatic.  
0.619000	I am usually nervous about what they will tell me that I have.  The last thing you want to hear when you see the doctor about having headaches is that you have brain cancer.  I seem to always think the worst.
0.547600	Finding something that was unexpected.  Going in for a routine exam and getting bad news would be the worst. 
0.476200	I just don't like doctors offices or hospitals in general.  I have never had any health issues so I am not afraid something is wrong with me.  I just have never liked them.
0.142900	If I have a problem that I'm unsure what it is. Everyone is always scared of the what seems like the inevitable. The inevitable is the big C word. Cancer. Either we die from a heart related problem or cancer most likely. It's just a matter of time.

0.357100	What makes me feel most anxious at the doctor's office is, by far, getting immunizations. While I agree to get any that are recommended, even ones that aren't strictly required by the office or by my college because I believe in taking any health precautions available to me, I am very afraid of needles and get almost pancicked when I need to have a shot.
0.285700	I get worried and anxious when I'm not sure if my problems will require some kind of procedure or if I will get a diagnosis I don't want to hear (like having cancer). The doctor herself doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or nervous, it is the consequences related to my problems that make we worried.
0.523800	I am not sure what it is. I guess I am introverted so sitting in a quiet room with someone I donât know well is uncomfortable. Also I donât want them to think I am seeking drugs 
0.333300	I know I am going to feel foolish saying this but I absolutely hate getting shots. It's not the pain that it causes but rather the mental build-up of thinking of the needle going in you and all the blood.
0.190500	I have anxiety, and going to do anything where I am being examined bothers me to some extent. I don't worry about any potential problems, it's just general anxiety.
0.285700	I think the worst part of it is just the waiting and the anxiety that provides to you, not knowing what might happen or what is wrong with you

0.285700	I'm generally not a person that worries much about anything. Unless, I am in a great deal of pain or agony, I'm confident that there's nothing seriously wrong with me. Now, if there's every an instance where I'm experiencing great pain and the doctor can't figure out why, then that would make me anxious.
0.428600	When I am waiting to be told what is wrong, because you are left in a room alone for a decent amount of time. Your mind seems to wonder off and start thinking of everything that could be wrong. 
0.142900	usually I am most anxious or worried when I have to visit the doctors office for my children. I never want to see my children in pain and taking them to the doctor with the thought that they may need a surgery or another inverention is what worries me. I also want to make sure I am making the best deicions for my child's health - it is a big responsibility to have someone else's health in your hands when they cannot make decisions for themselves yet.
0.714300	I just get the feelings that I would expect most people to get.  If you're at the doctor then something must be wrong.  I just want to get it over with and get out of there.  If you are having fun and enjoy visiting the doctor then something is not right with you!
0.619000	What makes me feel the most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is the unknown. Generally, when I am going to the doctor's office, I don't know what is wrong with me and I fear the worst in some circumstances.
0.785700	Sometimes the most common thing is the unknown. What if they find something wrong with me that is far worse. I would sometimes rather not know then to know something is wrong. That would be the only real fear, or worry is finding out something that might be truly wrong.

0.666700	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is getting the results back from lab work.

I dread the idea that I may have some kind of serious illness and that it will affect my life significantly. 
0.595200	I experience this as many times. When I want to saw the doctor, at that time he come to office too late or leave. This behavior is the worst behavior of the Doctor's attitude. This is very wrong action. 
0.190500	Being diagnosed with cancer would have to be my number one worry, even though I have never been diagnosed with it before, its just a really worry for me, and I do things in my life to try to avoid this diagnosis.
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious is if they discover something that is wrong with me that I do not expect in the least. I am a very healthy person, but it would be extremely upsetting if something like that came up.
0.785700	The fear that I've not taken care of myself well enough and it will result in a malady that I could have avoided.  The prospect of not being well for my children.

0.309500	I really can't think of anything, other that coming in one day and finding out a have a NEW doctor that I wasn't informed of beforehand, especially after having gotten used to my current one.

0.690500	"I get nervous by the ""formality"" of the setting. Sometimes the setting is too clinical and not very personable. I worry about these things and not about the outcome of the visit."
0.452400	Normally, I'm pretty healthy. I think the waiting time both in the lobby and in the examination room just gives the mind enough time to overthink things and think the doctor's going to be coming back with bad news. There's just a sense of uncertainty about what might pop up.
0.357100	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is really that it's just a one on one meeting with someone that I don't know very well, and that the things we talk about are on a very personal level.
0.976200	the unknown, not knowing what you could possibly find out about being sick. I worry about being judged by the doctors or nurses for my appearance or health care issues.

0.452400	I'm worried mostly about two things: 1) do I have a serious long term health issue that will be revealed to me? 2) If I mention minor things that are bothering me, will the doctor thing I'm wasting his/her time?

0.333300	I don't like people having to touch me as they are strangers and I feel my space is being violated. Also, I do not enjoy going to doctors.  I do it because I need to so I can be healthy.

0.761900	I'm always anxious that I will get some bad news about my health, especially if its something I don't see coming. I enjoy being active and feeling healthy. I wouldn't want anything to jeopardize that or to have a long/lasting effect on my family. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. However, I also would want to catch any problems as soon as possible to hopefully battle whatever it is that I have going on.
0.809500	I don't like waiting to see the doctor, and I don't like the small talk aspect of doctors in their offices. I just want a diagnosis, prescription, and to get out. I respect the medical profession but being in a waiting room full of sick people really makes me not want to go to the doctor at all. 
0.595200	Well i am worried they might find out i have some reare diease or something like that and that could have a big impact on my life and well being
0.571400	that he isnt going to give me a proper diagnosis and just give me anything to get me in and out of the office. i am to the point where i am not going to want to go there anymore. the hospital system is fine it is just the care isnt there,

0.738100	I am worried that they will discover something that is wrong with me. I know i am healthy but there is always a suspicion that something is wrong and they will discover it. It just more nerves about having a bad disease discovered.

0.142900	That I'm told there is something wrong with me then I will feel anxious.  I just hope there is no bad news whenever I go to the doctor.  Hoping not to hear anything but good news that all is well or will get better. 
0.357100	I worry most that the treatment will be invasive, or there will be a lot of negative side effects for any medication required.
0.381000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office is how much its all going to cost when its over especially if he finds something that requires further actions such as surgery or more blood work.

0.595200	"I'm most concerned that the doctor will find something wrong with me that was clearly my fault.  It's not so much that there's something wrong with me that bothers me; it's being faulted for my lifestyle and choices.  That seems really backwards and silly, perhaps, but that's my bigger fear.  It's not them saying, ""There's something wrong with you.""  It's them saying, ""You haven't been taking care of yourself."""

0.547600	I don't like being weighed and evaluated by the medical assistant. I would rather not see so many people when getting care.
0.666700	I don't like the impersonality there often is when being examined. It feels, sometimes, like being a car or something else that is being checked for malfunctions, rather than a person: the way you are led to a room and have to sit around waiting for the doctor, for instance. It also feels somewhat invasive to be examined in that way, and that makes me self-conscious.
0.142900	the cost or chance some of my blood work would come back showing a positive result for some unforeseen disease.
0.142900	The only thing that makes me feel anxious. Is I had surgery for female reproductive problems.

0.952400	I am usually worried about what the doctor will say. I don't want to hear any bad news. I also worry that they won't find anything when I know there is something wrong. There have been times where my doctor would say that I was fine, but I knew I wasn't. I also am anxious about what type of tests they will do. My biggest fear is blood work. I usually know when I am getting it, but I always hope they won't do it. 
0.381000	I am always concerned about discovering I have a sickness, or being lied to by my doctor in some way
0.309500	Whenever I'm visiting the doctors office I feel like I tend to get the most anxious whenever I have to be weighed.

0.738100	I worry the most about my health being worse than the previous time that I saw him. I get anxious that he can tell that I have not been following his guidelines perfectly in regards to taking care of my personal health.
0.142900	I think i'm pretty healthy, my doctor says so. So i don't really fell worried or anxious visiting him. Basically it's just the routine checkup, what can go wrong? 
0.666700	I get worried that the doctor will find something is seriously wrong with me and I'll be blindsided by the diagnosis. I once had a regular checkup with my OB GYN where my doctor suspected I had a lump and referred me for a mammogram. This was alarming as I had no idea that would be an issue. I was also in my 20s. The mammogram showed that I was fine. But now I worry about it happening again.
0.285700	I am worried that the doctor might find a problem that has persisted for a while but has been unknown to me because there were no symptoms. I worry that the problem could be expensive to treat, or that it might be debilitating. I am not worried about talking to the doctor. In fact, I'd rather know about a problem sooner than later.
0.500000	I think it is just being anxious about your overall health. You do not want anything to be wrong, so you keep thinking about the worst case scenarios while waiting at the doctor's office and you can not get the thoughts out of your head.
0.690500	I worry about judgement of my ability to express my concern adequately. I have encountered many impatient doctors. I often remember questions that I wanted to ask after I leave the appointment.
0.761900	I just worry that I might have to go through another surgery.  I also have a fear in needles  I also just have bad experience with doctors when I was child.
0.309500	That they will find something wrong with my health. I am also still a liittle nervous about injections/vaccinations. The older I get, the more anxiety I have about that
0.571400	Usually if I am seeing a doctor it is because something is wrong.  I am a natural worrier and tend to worry that it is the worst case scenario.  Even though I usually know deep down it's not the worst case scenario, I feel tense until the doctor tells me that.
0.142900	If I don't know what is happening to my body. When the symptoms are unknown and I am anxious to find out what is wrong. Only happened to me twice. I think it is the unknown that rattles people.
0.761900	I have heard doctors tell me nothing is wrong so many times, and it makes me feel powerless. When I see a new doctor, I am worried that this doctor is going to be like most of the doctors I've had before.
0.500000	I feel most anxious or worried when i visit my doctor's office because i am worried that he might find something else wrong with me. But i trust that he will know how to fix it.
0.428600	Feeling anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office can be caused by apprehension. The possibility of sick people in the waiting room -- passing along their own illness is always a concern.
0.285700	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I've been there enough times that most visits are routine and anything major can be dealt with during the visit or by a referral to another doctor.
0.452400	Sometimes I feel anxious going to doctor because Im scared to know that I have problem in my body. I tried to make my self healthy and avoid bad things that can affect daily living. Doctors sometimes makes me feel sick.
0.238100	I get anxious if I think something is seriously wrong. If I have a very concerning symptom, like a lump or blood....that usually makes me nervous. Otherwise, I am generally at ease while at the doctors office.
0.404800	That my weight has gone up, that my doctor will judge me, that there will be some sort of bad news. 
0.166700	I am not usually anxious in the doctor's office. I know that there is not anything wrong with me health wise, so I am always confident that I am in good shape. Occasionally I get anxious walking in, but that is it.
0.142900	Just hearing some bad news but I know they are just doing their job at the end of the day, so whatever they do is understandable.
0.571400	I hate small talk with people I don't know that well. Hate answering the same questions over and over, especially ones I don't think are their business or that I know how they are going to respond and I also know I am not going to change my behavior. 
0.452400	The thing that makes me feel most anxious is the thought that something might be wrong with me.  It has nothing to do with my doctor or how he performs checkups or physicals.
0.214300	I just don't like not knowing what's wrong.  Sometimes when I go to the dr I jump to the worst possible scenario of what my ailment could be and probably over stress about something that I don't need to stress out about.
0.690500	I have had a recent bad experience of finding out a health conflict I am working through. So now I am on hyper alert and nervous about possible other health issues.
0.238100	i do not feel particularly anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. if i had to choose something, then i would say that waiting for test results may sometimes make me feel a little bit anxious.
0.714300	Embarrassment mostly. I have GAD and every unknown situation feels me with dread. Pelvic exams are especially uncomfortable.
0.142900	Well now adays I am mainly anxious that the costs of the visit will out weigh the need to go in the first place, I am a woman so I am technically now a pre existing condition.
0.666700	"After having blood work, I know my cholesterol is high and I know that he is going to ""lecture"" me about my eating habits which makes me very uncomfortable, he wants me to bring it down naturally."
0.285700	When I not sure what I will face with the doctor. I felt anxious. If I have to stay there for too long or have a lot of exams, I feel nervous of course.
0.595200	Well it's always a scary situation as you get older when you go to the doctor because even if it's something minor they may find something major and the thought is always scary. 
0.500000	Not knowing what the problem is that you are seeing the doctor for.  SOmetimes small little pains can lead to big problems.  That will definitely cause me to be anxious and worried.
0.500000	The thought of finding out that something is worse than i thought. Especially during the cancer screening. I also worry when i am actually hurt because i know now that they are less likely to prescribe useful medication because of the opium epidemic. A cough that used to get prescribed cough medicine now gets crazy lung numbing pills that are newish to the market. not a fan. I worry about anything they may find, and how i will pay for all of it. 
0.785700	I struggle with my weight and it makes me uncomfortable when at the doctors, also I'm always worried that there is the possibility that they will find something truly wrong and expensive.
0.714300	There is always sense of anxiety when you go the doctor. You might feel healthy and fine, and then the doctor  might find something. It happened to me a few times, when I went to the doctor. So, there always there sense of uneasiness. Just my 2 cents. 
0.285700	I simply get nervous thinking something will be wrong with me which is seriously life threatening. Sometimes I get like this, but it isn't often. My anxiousness subsides once I see the doctor. 
0.571400	I'm a very introverted person.  I prefer to keep to myself and am usually comfortable talking with anyone outside my immediate family about health issues or mental health issues.  As such, even though I'm fairly familiar with my primary care physician, it still makes me a bit uncomfortable and a bit nervous, or anxious.
0.571400	I get nervous about being around a lot of sick people. If I'm seeing a different doctor than normal I'm worried that they won't take me seriously. I also worry that there might be something really wrong with me if I can't figure out what is wrong on my own.
0.857100	I am always anxious that I will receive a diagnosis for a terminal disease such as cancer or heart disease.  It makes me feel very nervous because that is one of my greatest nightmares.
0.714300	I am worried that something will be wrong with me or that I will need to undergo expensive treatment. 
0.261900	I get most worried that I'll be told I have a serious medical condition of some kind, particularly cancer. My family doesn't have a history of cancer or anything, but some of my behavior throughout my life with substance abuse has led to what I think is a higher risk of certain cancers, so that is what makes me most anxious about going to a doctor. But it's not something I dwell on.
0.785700	Not know what they are doing to find or say about what they find. They always say something is wrong so they can push a pill or want you to come back and keep paying them. The health system isnt really designed to cure you because they would lose customers then.
0.571400	i worry they are going to push drugs. I like to do things holistically and the militry drs dont often like that
0.381000	While being pregnant, I always worried about the doctor appts. Is the baby ok? Will the heartbeat sound strong? Are there complications.  I have found that specifically with this circumstance, I was very anxious.
0.785700	I am mostly worried that my care will not be effective or that I don't receive the best care locally. I travel two hours away to a large city for specialized care that is muck better
0.452400	I sometimes feel a little anxious about going to the doctorâs office because my family has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Although I try to eat better and exercise regularly, I sometimes feel that I am going to get bad news from my physician. There are so many factors right now in regards to eating habits, physical fitness, and stress that may easily change your health outcomes. I sometimes associate doctorâs visits with something going wrong in your life. I always expect the worst and think that something bad is going to happen to me and that I need to change something.   
1.000000	"When visiting the doctor's office, my biggest worry is that they will ""find something seriously wrong.""  I don't think that is an uncommon fear, and maybe not even irrational, but it does occur."
0.738100	THINKING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. KNOWING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG AND MY LIFE MIGHT CHANGE JUST LIKE THAT.
0.714300	I never liked hospitals or clinics. Those places always made me anxious as a kid and I guess I never got over it. My fear of needles also contributes to that anxiousness. 
0.571400	There are a few things that seem to make me feel almost anxious or even worried when visiting the doctor's office. One of those things include diseases that can be spread from patient to patient.
0.285700	I am usually not worried when I visit the doctor's office. I take most things as they come. If I had to think of something that makes me anxious, it's the thought of what the visit to the office might cost me, and how much I will have to pay out of pocket since I don't have insurance. Other than that, I don't get nervous when I go to the doctor.
0.809500	What makes me feel most anxious is just not knowing whether or not I'm alright medically. I don't know if I'll need to increase, decrease, or change my medication.
0.595200	I always worry that there may be something serious with my health.  Recently I have started to have all sort of problems.  There seems to be something with every part of my body.  
0.642900	The potential for being disagnosed with something new and dangerous can make me feel worried.  The potential for being pressured into new medicines and/or shots can make me feel worried.  Being told to take 2 different blood medications when I have not yet started taking the first one makes me feel worried and manipulated.
0.666700	I feel most afraid that the doctor will gloss over what I am saying and not try to understand. I then cannot be reassured by anything said.
0.428600	I always worry that they will find something that is going to be a problem in my life.  I think I go in hoping for the best and expecting the worse.  But so far so good, nothing wrong with me yet.(knock on wood)
0.238100	Wondering how much the payment will be. Wondering what I might need to solve my issues. Wondering if I could get help for my migraines or would I be stuck with them.
0.571400	I am usually nervous when i need to have any blood work done. It is a terrible feeling, especially if you have to do it on an empty stomach. No matter the assurance that the doctor gives me, i still know that it is going to be an unpleasant experience.
0.881000	I am afraid that something will be discovered that has gone unnoticed, such as cancer! I am nervous at being inspected closely. I am nervous that something is wrong that will be missed or misdiagnosed. I am nervous about my body shape or life choices being judged. I am nervous about the financial cost. I am nervous that some drug will be recommended that I do not want to take or that will be expensive or will have side effects.
0.428600	I always feel like I am going to hear bad news when I go to the doctor for a checkup. I have been dealing with a disease since a very young age and I recently have begun to feel like maybe this illness is even worse than anyone originally thought.
0.619000	I think when an exam takes place you are always worried about the doctor finding something serious. You never want to hear you have cancer or something  along those lines. 
0.285700	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the thought of them finding something that could lead to a terminal diagnosis such as cancer. I do smoke cigarettes (about a pack a day) so sometimes I worry that something would be found to indicate the need for more testing. Uncertainty makes me nervous if it's for something that could potentially be serious. I am generally not anxious or worried when going to the doctor's office though. 
0.500000	The thing that makes me the most anxious is that they will diagnose me with something worse than what I expect.  Also, I sometimes worry they will notice something irregular that I didn't notice on my own, such as a tumor or heart conditions like high blood pressure.
1.000000	Well usually when I go its cause theres something wrong with me thats causing a pretty bad ailment and so I already go into it expecting something bad. I can be a bit of a hypochondriac and that may play on my experience a little bit. But then its also because a lot of the procedures they must do to check you out, are uncomfortable or downright painful. And sometimes, doctors tell you that there is something they found that concerns you and they get you super worried, when they shouldnt say anything until test results come back. Many times I have had them distress me thinking I had an issue such as an enlarged/inflamed liver, just to find out theres absolutely nothing wrong with my liver. The days of stress from worrying waiting for those results is unnecessary. 
0.285700	A long wait makes me feel anxious.  If the doctor were to suggest a test that I was not expecting I would be worried.
0.595200	I just do not like to go the doctor. I worry that the doctor might find something that is wrong or tell me something that I do not want to hear. I worry that my test results might not bge good.
0.523800	"One incident stands out from my 67 years - my current physician said ""we"" needed to check my heart again. Turns out I had a murmur. Subsequent tests revealed a mitral valve problem, which will be corrected via robotic surgery. That was scary for me and still is as the surgery has not been scheduled. Generally, I am somewhat apprehensive concerning new complaints (e.g, a mole). Part of my anxiety is related to having seen family members suffer with various diseases. For example, my father died of cancer at age 40 (I was 11). My mind tends to go to ""cancer"" when I have an otherwise unexplained pain. Generally, however, I find the typical examination to be quite routine and not anxiety inducing (except in the circumstances i have outlined above)."
0.285700	If the doctor found something strange or maligns after the tests.  If I have a chronic condition that affects my entire life. 
0.547600	Mostly just wondering if theres anything wrong with you that you don't know about, and the possibility of it being something dangerous like cancer. Everyone has a fear of uncertainty that makes them uncomfortable and nervous.
0.190500	I feel most anxious when I have to wait a long time after a blood test or x-ray or similar tests. I also feel very anxious when the doctor seems to be in thoughts when I am sitting in front of him. I am also anxious when what the doctors says is not clear to me or he talks in a very complicated way.
0.857100	I worry that the cancer in my eye is active again.  I worry that the doctor is going to tell me that i need my eye out.  I worry that the cancer will spread...even though it was small and i had radiation treatment to hopefully correct it. I worry that my family will fall apart if something re-occurs in my body.  I wonder that the doctor will tell me that I need more treatment and that it's not over
0.142900	i just hope that there is nothing wrong with me and hearing everything is all good that make me feel happy
0.142900	Getting blood work because my veins are not good. I hate that I may get stuck 4 or more times in order to get blood done. 
0.547600	Getting an uncertain or negative diagnoses would cause worry or anxiety. For myself or a loved one. THe feelings are the same
0.285700	sometimes having ot ask for my anti depressant medicine to be refilled gives me a little anxiety because I kinda still feel ashamed and wnoder if they really want to fill it for me.
0.523800	Well, I don't want any bad news. Also, I just feel like I want to get it over with. I feel as if I am very rushed.
0.142900	I usually am worried about the cost. Also I worry that my illness or pain might be something worse that will cost more to treat. 
0.619000	That I will get bad news.   That the doctor will tell me something bad about my health.  I also worry that I will have to undergo more tests or treatments.
0.333300	I am nervous about my weight and what they will say to tell me to lose it.  I get anxious that I will be judged.  I hate putting on a thin gown and the office always seems cold.  I hate the paper and waiting an undisclosed amount of time.
0.666700	Worst part is the waiting room, where I come up with worst case scenarios in my mind about all the horrible things that arenât wrong, but they could be. Basically my own mind is why Iâm anxious and worried, nothing more.
0.357100	If I have maybe a bump or an ailment which I kind of worry if it's something more. The head games you play with yourself where you try to play doctor but really your brain just goes to worst case scenarios. 
0.761900	I feel anxious when I got to the doctor because sometimes im not sure what they will tell me. I get worried because they could tell me im dying and there is nothing that they can do about it and that its too far gone, or they could misdiagnose me and then I could die from getting treatment that I dont even need. 
0.190500	Not knowing why I feel the way I am and is it a really problem or just I need to keep a better check on myself
0.881000	Expenses are a big part of it, but I also don't feel very thrilled about finding out what may be wrong with me either.  Plus, my injury made me feel very useless, I couldn't work or do a lot of other things and those feelings sort of colored all of the experiences that I had at the time if that makes any sense.
0.333300	that i cant afford it or im going to have something keeping me off work too long. the wait also makes me anxious.
0.381000	because i am not sure if i will ever get better an i tell the dr iwnt to get better but he says its a long journey
0.357100	I never know what is going to be said so I always have some level of anxiety with doctors visits. I also have had a few bad experiences. 
0.928600	I am anxious that the doctor visit will end up costing a lot of money. Sometimes I think that ignorance is bliss and I would rather not know if something is wrong. If you look hard enough something will always be less than perfect.
0.547600	i'm always anxious about results and i hate having to wait. the wait always makes me worry more and i'm the type of person that usually thinks the worst when something comes up
0.714300	The most worrying experience would be getting bad news or news about a problem that will be hard to fix. Also, getting news that will include discomfort or inconvenience.
0.714300	I always feel anxious about visiting the doctor. I worry about my test results from my last visit. I worry that I will get better news about my health. 
0.666700	I worry that there might be some bad result or that I might be sick and not know it.  I get scared that the test being performed might not have the result I want.  I get nervous days before doctor appointments.  And if I have a procedure done I worry even more because I have to wait for the results.  The waiting is the thing that really makes me worry, if I know I am going to have to wait for some results I lose sleep the week before I have to go in.  Losing sleep makes me even more anxious and by the time I get to the appointment I am really uneasy.  Not knowing the outcome really makes me scared.
0.523800	What makes me feel most anxious is not know if something serious is wrong. Also, there are worries about medical coverage and insurance. Costs of medical treatment also make me anxious.
0.571400	I am worried since I am getting older that something will go wrong. As you age, it's sure that something won't work like it used to.  I want to make sure that I am examined thoroughly and that the doctor spends time doing the appropriate tests.
0.690500	I hate stepping on the scale and I hate to be partially naked in front of people I don't know. I'm also always a little nervous that the small thing I mention just in case, could turn out to be something big and a bad diagnosis. 
0.571400	I am a breast cancer survivor so I am always anxious before any doctor appointment now. I feel like I would rather not go and not risk getting anymore surprise bad news. This usually occurs with blood testing or any other types of medical tests. I felt fine before I was diagnosed so I know that there is a chance to feel good and not know something is wrong inside. It will probably make me feel this way for the rest of my life.
0.619000	The thing that makes me the most anxious is when a doctor does not talk much when they dont act like they care.  When a doctor seems like he is having a bad day can make me anxious 
0.142900	The thing that always gets me going is the blood pressure cuff.  It gets really tight around my arm, and I've always hated that.  But actually seeing the doctor is usually pleasant and problem-free. 
0.761900	The thing that really bothers me about going to the doctor is that he will order another MRI on my back again. I had a frightening extreme case of claustraphobia one time a year ago in a very small MRI machine and I am afraid that I will experience that again.
0.976200	I'm and anxious and worried that I may have a fatal disease. Also, my blood pressure always rises when she first comes into the room. She says it's a phenom called white coat syndrome. I also hate having my weight taken because I am fearful that I have gained too many pounds and will have to go on a diet. 
0.571400	I am afraid they will discover something about my health that will be negative, about which I was previously unaware.  Sometimes, I worry they will suggest preventative measures such as immunizations, with which I am not 100% comfortable.  However, in my experience, most doctors I have encountered are quite accommodating to different approaches (mine is more wholistic) to health, as long as they are working/workable.
0.571400	There is always the possibility of finding out something is really wrong or that something is going to be extremity difficult to treat. 
0.428600	I think I know how things will go, but there's always the possibility that I've missed something. I am never 100% confident in my ability to judge.
0.595200	When I have to have blood drawn or put through other tests to confirm or deny diagnoses. That is very stressful because I have to wait for results and while I am getting my blood drawn most phlebotomist do not know what they are doing
0.714300	When I visit a doctor's office I feel most worried when his or her expression is worried and when he or she can't explain exactly what is going on.
0.357100	I am a very reserved person and being examined, even by someone I trust, feels somewhat invading.  I also am thinking about whether the exam will produce any negative findings such as high blood pressure or less than favorable results with any bloodwork that has been done.  I go in trying to relax and talking to myself in a soothing way but it usually just makes me more tense.  
0.404800	I think there is always the thought in the back of my mind that something might be discovered that is a big health problem. I don't stay worried about this constantly, but that thought creeps up most times when I go to the doctor. There is cancer in my family history for example, and sometimes I worry about that. Really, it's just a general thought that pops up during doctor visits.
0.166700	Mostly about pain.  If I know that a shot or some test like bloodwork is required, I do not like it.  It's not enough to make me avoid them but it does add to my slight worry.  
0.142900	I am always completely relaxed when I go to visit my doctor's office. He is very friendly and his staff always puts me at ease.
0.357100	I typically feel anxious. I think the only thing that ever worries me is if I think that something is wrong and I am worried about what treatment might be recommended or potential side effects. I am also sometimes worried when I know that I am going to have something painful done
0.619000	"Anxiety is two-pronged, in this case: first, that the doctor may ""find something"" in my results, and second, the fact that he or she might not actually be correct about those findings. Doctors, again, are only human, and prone to mistakes or oversights. This makes all of their claims at least somewhat suspect. "
0.285700	It makes me feel worried that he tells me that I have some disease, that gives me a lot of pain if he told me that
0.857100	I really get anxious when I think about my labs coming out bad. The doctor always seems like it is my fault they are coming out bad even though I'm trying my hardest to improve my health.
0.595200	I wonder at what halfassed shit they are going to try and push on to me. The place I go is a little hick clinic. Nice enough people for around here but not well educated enough to suit me.
0.857100	When I go to my doctor's office for a check up, I am always anxious that my blood tests will show that something is wrong. I tested in the pre-diabetic range last time I went, so this is a worry for me right now.
0.476200	Nothing really in particular, I just have doctor anxiety -- along with general anxiety. I think the doctor called it White Coat Anxiety or something like that.
0.523800	I GET ANXIOUS AND WORRIED ABOUT STUPID THINGS. MY JOB, MY FUTURE, MONEY, MY FUTURE RETIREMENT. BILLS
0.619000	Not knowing what the outcome will be and it there has to be something done how bad will it hurt and how long will it take to heal.
0.881000	I feel anxious that I won't get the right diagnosis or that the doctor won't tell me preventative or natural methods to my health issues.  I don't just want a drug.  I want to know how to prevent my condition from getting worse and what natural steps I can take for my health before taking a drug.
0.571400	"My doctor does my ""well woman"" exams. I don't think that any woman is entirely comfortable with that. My doctor has a good personal manner of dealing with people, though.  I think any time that I put on a gown with no back on it and nothing underneath, I am not going to be at my most confident."
0.595200	Im anxious when I go to the doctor sometimes because I dont know what to expect when I go there. In the back of my head I feel like everything is going to be fine but you never know.
0.619000	"I'm not talking about my primary physician. The NP that I use is awesome. I'm thinking about the orthopedic Doc that I see because of a broken arm. I've seen him for 2 years and I get butterflies in my tummy every time. He is so quick when he talks to me, doesn't listen to me and talks ""over"" me. I always go in worried about what he is going to say. "
0.785700	I'm afraid they're going to point out a medical problem that may be damaging to me. I'm unsure whether or not I can trust them to make the right diagnosis and prescribe what I need. 
0.904800	"I am always worried about how much the visit will end up costing. If my doctor recommends or requires lab tests or imaging, I often can't afford to pay the bill. I have ""good"" health insurance, but in the US ""good"" health insurance still isn't enough for many of us."
0.642900	Typically I feel that way when Iâm having a basic procedure done and routine exam. Not sure why because itâs not the Dr. 
0.476200	I am always worried about getting bad news or bad test results. Doctors offices always just make me feel uneasy. 
0.285700	I feel anxious most to find out my condition. I get nervous to see my results, more than how the doctor views me. 
0.976200	I get really anxious about all aspects of visiting a doctor's office. I'm usually very nervous before I even get there. I dread getting weighed. I'm always worried that they will find something seriously wrong with me, even if I'm just there for a minor illness or an annual physical. 
0.666700	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is not know what I may have, or what medication I have to take. I am also concerned with the fees I may have to pay.
0.428600	What makes me nervous about being at the doctor's office is being around people who I think are sick.  I'm afraid I will get sick just by being there. 
0.333300	I am getting to an age where cancer becomes more prevalent and also because of family history. I am certain that i will receive the proper care and support from my health care provider and family, but it is still an unknown concern.
0.547600	I am often worried about whether I will be treated with respect, more than anything. Or that the doctor I see will dismiss whatever I am struggling with. I also struggle a little with blood draws-- I get incredibly faint. Sometimes I am nervous for my own health, but most of the time if I'm not seeing my primary care doctor, I'm just rolling the dice as to whether I'll get someone rude and disinterested or someone who's an actual professional.
0.142900	What makes me the most worried when visiting the doctors office is finding out if I have a heath related problem that is not good for me. 
0.261900	The prospect of pain or experiencing something physically uncomfortable - having a boil lanced, or a skin biopsy taken. 
0.738100	Being told that something is severely wrong with me. I just had this happen recently when I went for a physical and ANS turned up positive (auto immune issue). I still have to go to another lab for a more detailed test and I've been putting it off since I kind of dread it, plus, it's is a hassle. I'm also always uneasy when I'm getting examined I don't have a specific reason, I just don't like it. I also hate getting undressed and having the whole staff in and out and you are sitting there naked in a paper gown. 
0.357100	I am comfortable with the exam and tests themselves. What makes me feel anxious is the results of any tests or exams. I guess you could say the unknown. 
0.690500	Overall I do not like doctors, and I have had bad experiences with uncaring doctors before and I do not want to repeat those situations again
0.595200	I feel anxious because of the waiting room and germs (I am a bit of a germophobia and am afraid I might contract an illness while waiting). I also get worried about maybe being pinpointed from the doctor if I didn't follow there instructiosn to the t
0.404800	I always have a little unease that they may find something that is not right. I have always had good health but you never know. 
0.285700	Being in good health and being able to maintain good health. Not wanting to have any issues with my blood work or health. 
0.904800	First of all if there will be something seriously wrong with me. Secondly, if there is something seriously wrong with me and the doctor doesn't realize it because she is rushing through so she can move on to the next patient. Just her getting the diagnoses wrong in general. 
0.619000	First of all coming to appointment on time and waiting for up to an hour for the doctor. Then expectation of lack of details after exam.
0.523800	Thinking that he will find something that is wrong that I didn't know about. That there will be something major that will affect my life.
0.881000	I fear that they will find something seriously wrong with me, and they will want to prescribe drugs that have serious side effects.  I also feel that the mind has alot to do with how healthy we are, and once people know that they have a serious illness or disease, they give up, so to speak and go downhill rapidly.
0.476200	When visiting the doctor's office, I am most worried about hearing bad news. The moments leading up to the visit itself is most nerve-racking. 
0.142900	What makes me anxious is that my doctor finds something really wrong with me. That would be one of my biggest fears, and to be honest is what makes it harder for me to get a check up from my doctor. Though my doctor does his best to make me feel that I am as comfortable that I can be. No one really wants to hear any type of bad news. Once I hear that everything is fine with my health from my doctor then that is when all of my anxiety disappear. That is what worry about the most.
0.761900	It is always the waiting process, I feel very dizzy at hospitals because of the classic smell and the test results make me nervous even is they might be very good.
0.857100	Not knowing what the doctor is going to say or what the test results are going to be.  Needles and blood make me nervous
0.738100	I am greatly uncomfortable getting blood drawn. I immediately get very fearful of this once I step into the doctors office. It's uncomfortable to have someone touch you and to not have clothes on, etc.
0.666700	I sometimes fear that we will discover something that will have morbid consequences.  It is somewhat irrational when I have no underlying symptoms.  But I cannot help it.
0.142900	Actually, I'm not worried when visiting my primary care physician. On occasion, I have been concerned when visiting a specialist regarding what they might find wrong but that is short-lived as I am always determined to approach whatever issue by working with the physician to resolve it.
0.452400	That I may or may not have a serious health confliction and in having one my doctor will look down on me and judge me. I am also afraid about how much everything will cost me in the end
0.357100	There is always a concern that the doctor will find something wrong with me that is serious.  He could discover something that turns out to be fatal.
0.261900	I always get a little worried something will be wrong. My health is very important to me so I get anxious about it.
0.761900	I think that the things hat makes me the most anxious is just not knowing what to expect.  I often start to imagine the worst situations, like the doctor will find something terribly wrong with me and I let my imagination get the best of me.  I also tend to think that procedures and exams are going to be more uncomfortable than they actually are.
0.619000	I often feel worried that the doctor will give me bad news. I am worried that something some day will be seriously wrong with me and I will have to make a major life change to survive.
0.381000	Health matters are always something to worry about. If we dont have our health then what do we have? My doctor was very open when alerting me to things I really need to worry about and address
0.690500	That the problem is much worse than what was anticipated.  In general medical office or hospitals give me anxiety, which compounds the issue of worry and anxiousness.
0.476200	"I don't feel overly anxious or worried, it's more like a small bit of ""what if I'm really sick"" or the doctor finds something abnormal. "
0.428600	I get a little nervous about judgement maybe. Like they'll think Im a hypochondriac if I tell them everything I need help with. I don't like the smell of the place, that alcohol smell. I don't like people touching me. I don't like how you're shoved around like cattle into different rooms. I don't like the front office at doctor's office, they are usually cold and sterile. Just say hello to a patient would be nice. LOL
0.761900	I hate sitting in the waiting room. It is noisy, dirty, and loud with patients, kids and the TVs blasting. The waiting room is not conducive to people who have mental disorders. Then when I am answering the basic, every visit questions (like do I feel like hurting myself or others) I feel anxious that he is not listening or caring how I really feel unless I answer opposite of what I know the correct answer is. He barely looks at me when talking to me and has used another patient's name when writing my prescriptions. I don't trust him nor do I even like him. I want to go back to my other doctor.
0.142900	What makes me the most anxious is that I'm afraid my kids might catch a bug and get sick. Especially my middle son who has a PICC line so he can get sick very easily.
0.500000	The times when I don't know what's wrong with me, or how much it's going to cost. Also if I don't know what to do after the doctor leaves the room (do I wait for a nurse? do I go to the checkout desk? do I just leave?)
0.571400	who knows, there are so many symptoms that can be said to be related to all kinds of diseases, nobody wants to let some body else tell them that they have diseases
0.857100	they will want to take my blood pressure and start treating me for something completely different from what i came there for. if you look for something you will find something and that is what they always do they think they are not doing their job if they don't give you treatment for something
0.785700	I get anxious when visited the doctor because I'm afraid of what they might find and that it will be bad news.
0.523800	I just do not like visiting the doctor.  This brings worry to me and makes me anxious.  also, I am an anxious person anyway so I stay anxious.
0.452400	I'm worried about the doctor telling me something is wrong with me or I'm anxious about the doctor seeing my penis because I've never had a woman look at it in my entire adult life and I feel like The 40 Year Old Virgin all the time regarding my lack of proficiency with the opposite sex.
0.452400	I don't like sitting around in the waiting room not know the people there nor knowing what is going to happen in the doctors office. Uncertainty is not my strong point. I like to know what is going to happen. I understand that can't always be the case but I like to eliminate variables. 
0.761900	I lost my mom to a stroke a few years ago so I am now anxious whenever I visit a doctor, I was not prior to suddenly losing my mother. I smoke (less then half a pack of cigarettes a day) and I know the negative impacts this can have on my health so I am always worried. Also my cousin's 18 year old son was just diagnosed with Cancer so I am now aware that anything can happen. 
0.309500	I am always worried about  visiting the doctor because you never know what the diagnosis might be it could be good or bad. 
0.309500	The only thing that I could think of is the fear that I may be sick. Other than that I'm not to fearful at the doctors
1.000000	I have a lot of things wrong with me and I am always afraid they will find something new or I will have to have more surgery which is very hard on me and my family
0.571400	I worry sometimes that something serious could be wrong with me.  So, when going to get checked out I fear that they will find something bad, instead of thinking it could be something minor.
0.404800	I sometimes feel anxious or worried because you never know what your blood tests will show even though you may be feeling fine.
0.761900	I'm a worrier, always have been, so seeing a doctor, even for a regular checkup, is nerve-wracking to me. I always think beforehand that the doctor will find something wrong or need to do a followup on something that's worrying to him. I tend to get myself worked up before doctor appointments, but that's just my personality.
0.142900	I have met with my new Dr. one time and walked away confident and peaceful that he is my primary Dr. Time will tell.
0.666700	I always feel slightly uncomfortable being examined, they may be more to do with my personal insecurities than with the doctor or the exam itself.
0.976200	I can't stand to be touched. I have PTSD from being raped and I absolutely hate when they want to do a gyn exam. I am never made to feel like this is okay. When I went to the county clinic for birth control they told me I couldn't have birth control until I allowed them to examine me even though I have never had sex other than being raped and I was hysterically crying. I just wanted to get birth control because I'm getting married and want to be prepared but I ended up leaving with nothing and felt so ashamed.
0.738100	I usually worry that they will find something wrong with me that is serious. I tend to assume the worst. I look to them to calm me down and help me see that chances are good it's nothing serious.
1.000000	I just have horrible white coat syndrome. We went to the doctor when we were little only if we were terribly ill. I think as a result, I have a profound fear of all medical surroundings. 
0.714300	Not really that I have some condition to where I'm going to die. Sometimes when the doctor is the opposite sex as me it sucks and I hold things back. Some times when it is clear the doctor isn't listening to me I get upset. And most of the time they will judge you and assume things with out knowing for sure. 
0.285700	I hate everything to do with getting any medical thing done.  It makes me feel sick just being there.  The worst by far is getting blood drawn.  I hate it so much and it makes me extremely anxious.
0.738100	I am always worried that something is going to be really wrong and also they it will cost a lot of money. 
0.857100	just not knowing the unknown of the whole situation. worrying about things that you might be wrong with you ect. 
0.571400	Just the act of going there.  The uncertainty of what could possibly happen and what the next steps would be.
0.547600	I get nervous around doctors. I am afraid they might find something really bad about me or it might cost a lot of money. I do not want to have to do any procedures or anything or they might be just judging me by my health, as a person not just a doctor. 
0.690500	What they are going to say. What they are going to find. The outlook. The coldness of the doctor. Having to explain things to the doctor. Them not listening. 
0.809500	Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.
0.428600	In general, what makes me the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is when I go for a specific reason. For example, STD testing or I have something I noticed that I want to seek attention for. These are the situations that cause the most anxiety because they aren't specifically routine, but conditional. While I do have an annual physical, I know what to expect based upon historical visits, but when something unexpected occurs it could be anything from minor to severe and you just aren't aware of it. What if that rash is something more? What if that mole isn't right and I need to be referred to a dermatologist? What if that cold wont go away as fast as it should? These are the kinds of situation that cause me anxiety.
0.452400	I think like most other people I'm most worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I've been very lucky with my health, and would like to stay that way so whenever I go for a checkup there's always a little bit of anxiousness that I might have some disease or something that I don't know about.
0.690500	Finding out I have a condition that cannot be treated or that is crazy expensive. I have issues with my own mortality, so anything that might be cancer always freaks me out.
0.833300	The reason that I'm there is usually not a good reason. That in itself causes me to have anxiety, especially if I am not feeling well, or have a problem. Also, medical procedures make me uncomfortable. Examinations usually also get personal or require talking about matters that make me uncomfortable by their nature. I'm also concerned that they are going to find something terrible, or that I'm going to have to do something that requires a lot of suffering to improve the situation.
0.690500	WHEN THE DOCTOR DO THE PHYSICAL CHECK AND KEEP TESTING OR DOING THE SAME TEST AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT GET ME WORRY THAT THERE IS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY HEALTH. 
0.285700	Finding out that my I might have inherited a health problem from a family member during a check up or analysis, that is always a major concern and cause for nervousness when booking a check up.
0.547600	I am always afraid that the doctor will find something very, very wrong. I used to watch a lot of hospital shows, where you go in for a hiccup and you end up dying. I have since stopped watching those and I have been less afraid.
0.333300	I think of the worst possible situations and get worried about being diagnosed with something bad. I am usually able to get those thoughts out of my head though.
0.309500	My biggest concern is that I will not be able to describe my symptoms clearly enough, or remember all the relevant bits, in order to convey the full picture to my GP. If I do a good job of explaining my symptoms, then I feel she does a good job of piecing the info together and coming up with options for me.
0.333300	There's not really alot that would make me worried about actually seeing the doctor. If anything I would be the most worried about why I am going to the doctor. If I dont know what is going on and it is something that has been bothering me, it more about the unknown. The other thing I would be nervous about is if I have to go to the doctor last minute and I have to see another doctor that I havent seen before. When you see your regular doctor there is already some trust there so seeing someone else doesnt feel right to me and it is hard to trust them because they are not my doctor. Lastly, when I go for my yearly exam it just makes me nervous because of the discomfort. 
0.452400	I hate the unknown, this is what causes so much anxiety when I go to the doctor.  My doctor actually tries to help the anxious feelings since she knows how I feel when I go.  I don't like surprises so my anxiety comes from not knowing what is going on or what will be done about it.  I wish I didn't feel this way so I wouldn't be so uncomfortable about going.
0.381000	I feel anxious or worried based upon whether my doctor will discover an issue with my health. This means that I will have to deal with the necessary research to determine if my health will require more attention as well as achieve the necessary footing to converse with my doctor on the subject of my health.
0.547600	I am just funny about people touching me so I get anxious about that.  Also that something might be found that I don't want to find out about.  Just the whole process of having to be examined.
0.642900	With my condition, I have seen alot of doctors. But still am a little nervous going to appointments. Just removing your clothes and having someone poking around. I think it's also the unknown. 
0.285700	The wait time makes me anxious. And having multiple ppl to interact with that could possibly be sick. 
0.690500	Are they going to be honest? Is this doctor actually a doctor for the right reasons? Who can be trusted? Why can't we find a middle ground as far as chemical drug treatments and nontraditional healing?
1.000000	I'm always worried that something terrible will be found, especially now that I'm getting old. I also worry that something will be misdiagnosed, sending me in a long spiral of unpleasant tests and more appointments that lasts for weeks. Since I don't fully trust doctors, I also don't trust them to cure me if something terrible is wrong.
0.523800	I am always afraid that they will want to draw blood from me.  I have a very severe phobia of needles and I almost always pass out.  It's embarrassing and I always have to explain myself before they start the process.  I usually tell them it's probably safer for everyone if they let me lay down somewhere while they are taking the blood.  I have hit the floor several times and hurt myself after passing out.  It's a terrible thing to live with.  
0.642900	I feel anxious when I am at the doctor's office because, even though I am healthy, there is always a chance that a medical problem could be discovered.
0.404800	I am a hypochondriac and believe that even the most minor symptom is due to something larger and i'm dying. When I visit the doctor, i feel he will confirm that i'm really sick,
0.809500	I am worried something wrong with me will be discovered. I would prefer to be healthy and not have to worry about dying/suffering so there is always that fear in the back of my mind.
0.857100	i often feel as though i cannot accurately describe my issues because i feel nervous or afraid, and when i do try, i often feel misunderstood or dismissed. i also worry about things i can not control, such as exposure to other sick people or uncertainty about the physicians own care and sterilization practices. 
0.142900	The only time i feel anxious is when i go for my annual mammogram.  Now that i get the digital kind its not as bad. I still get some anxiety. Any other time i go to dr i feel no anxiety. 
0.857100	Sometimes I'm worried that something might come up. Like I might have an illness that I didn't know about. The waiting is really intense sometimes. 
0.619000	I am always nervous that something will be wrong with me. I get nervous sitting in the waiting room because I imagine whatever symptoms I am experiencing could be a serious illness. I worry about the doctor not saying much because they get concerned while examining me.
0.547600	Test results. I have a few issues with my blood sugar and A1C, so I'm always a little anxious about what they will say about my sugars and my weight. I do not want to have insulin at any point in my life, so I've been working on controlling sugars without it. Sometimes I succeed, but not always. And a lot of doctors don't approve of the diet I'm using(ketogenic), unless they have a higher understanding of nutrition.
0.928600	Even though I trust my primary care physician, I still worry about my health. I worry the doctor might tell me some bad news about my health. I worry a pain I have might be cancer or something else serious. I worry about pain and death.
0.761900	I am afraid I'll have some horrible disease or find out that my doctor cannot help me in a way that will improve my well being. It feels tense because I don't know what to expect and am also afraid of being judged.
0.142900	Nothing , I selected nothing on the survey because it's true. I feel calm and fine in the doctors office. I have never been through a real medical scare to make me feel otherwise. 
0.357100	I always get anxious about blood work results. I never really get bad results but I sill worry a bit. My blood pressure is always a little high when I go in but this is a normal thing for me.
0.595200	It has nothing to do with my doctor herself, or her staff. I'm just not a huge fan of sitting in waiting rooms, and I feel like that tends to cause my heart rate to rise and then for me to just get nervous about being there in general. I feel like hospitals and doctor's offices just have a certain smell to them that I'll never fully get used to. My main issue with my health is also having a history of anxiety disorders, so that definitely plays a huge roll in how I feel about doctor's visits. I think that I work myself up thinking about the unknown, and fearing that something will be wrong, even when I'm just having a routing checkup and no reason to believe that something is actually wrong.
0.619000	It's a personal anxiety that is provoked when an extended period of time has passed between sessions, and I have to say that it doesn't help when they start asking directly related questions back to back.
0.642900	I always feel like my doctor doesn't want to be there and would rather be doing anything else, besides working.  I always feel like I am a burden and not someone who should be there because I deserve to be there.  I find my doctor is always on me about something.  I always feel like when I am asked a question, regardless of my answer, the doctor will interject something else I should do instead of any positive feedback.
0.404800	It is an irrational emotion that sometimes comes up, but not always.  I like to have the experience behind me each year.  As I have aged, this has been the case, for when I was young, I seldom saw a physician, except once for a gall bladder attack due to which, the gall bladder was removed. That period was somewhat anxious until over.  But that was 25 years ago. 
0.738100	Feeling anxious or worried about doctor's visits stems from the uncertainty of the entire experience. Not knowing if something is seriously wrong or even if your doctor will diagnose correctly.
0.428600	Although I'm seldom there because of sickness, there is always the possibility they'll discover something wrong.  That worry naturally increases with aging.
0.547600	I don't feel too anxious or worried during a visit because I know my body is generally healthy. However, I always know there is a chance something is wrong, which is why I wrote neutral.
0.857100	That I won't be listened to, or my illness will be dismissed with a bottle of pills and no alternative or other viewpoints.
0.309500	What makes me most anxious is not knowing a diagnosis. I am a planner, so when the outcome is not predictable, it makes me stressed out and worried. I am anxious until I find out what is wrong and how it can be fixed.
0.452400	What would make me feel anxious or worried is the unknown. Primarily aside from yearly check ups the reason for going to the doctor would because there is somethingwrong with my body. So the not know what is going on would make feel uneasy.
1.000000	Not knowing what is wrong with me or having the doctor or nurses find out additional problems that I had no idea about.
0.166700	I am just a worrier in general its my personality. At the doctor's office all that worries me is getting sick from touching something as I feel there are a lot of germs in these places.
0.357100	I am worried that they may find some problem that will require further surgeries and testing. Not that the doctor is unqualified.
0.666700	I think I get anxious just because it is usually for an acute problem, so it was not something I had scheduled. It ends up making me rebalance my board study schedule which makes me anxious. 
0.142900	I really don't have those feelings.  I guess when a new issue comes up  there might be a thought that it could be something bad and incurable but I don't dwell on things like that.
0.642900	I feel worried because I think about the possibility that I have an untreatable disease or a long term disease that will affect my life
0.714300	I am confident that I do not currently have major health issues, but I do struggle with extreme pain from a root cause that is not serious (life threatening). I get anxious when going to the doctor because my pain issues get dismissed due to my relative good health otherwise. I worry that my problem will never get solved and that going to the doctor is a waste of my time and money. 
0.428600	The one thing that causes me to be anxious or worried is that I sometimes put off going to the doctor over aches and pains and I am afraid he will find something majorly wrong with me. 
0.857100	I am always concerned about finding out information that yields a high likelihood of having a terminal type illness or chronic condition.  I guess I openly feel like I have a chronic condition which cannot be helped without surgery and/or medication.  Both of these alternatives really cause worry for me.  I do not like medication at all.  I feel that the side effects associated with them increase the problems associated with my health. Furthermore, I know any surgery can turn more problematic so I would say it is the uncertainty that makes me most anxious.
0.714300	Usually when I'm anxious for a Dr. visit it's when I'm feeling real bad and expecting the worst. In those cases it's always been less severe than I imagined which is a good thing.
0.833300	That they won't believe me. Or the that the next step in my treatment will be scheduled too far out and I have to wait a month to have a test done.
0.261900	Sometime the wait alone can be worrisome.  And if i am coming to grt some test results sometimes i feel a little uneasy hoping for the best outcome
0.142900	I wouldn't call what I feel when I visit a doctor's office either anxious or worried.  It's more like frustrated and indignant.  Especially when I'm on time and they are not.  I don't spend much time anxious or worried in general - why should a doctor's office be any different?  It is what it is - worry never helps.
0.619000	I am worried about something being wrong that would lead to expensive testing and treatments. I also worry about catching the flu from being around sick people in the waiting room.
0.285700	I am worried that the diagnosis will be worse than I initially thought. Although unlikely and Im not a hypochondriac, still, a small part of me feels very anxious about a bad diagnosis. 
0.428600	Are they going to be on time or are they going to keep me waiting around for an extended period of time?
0.690500	I am most anxious and worried when going to the doctors office because I am anxious that something will be wrong. There are several conditions that run in my family, like diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure and more.  Each time I go to the doctor, even for a routine physical, I am always anxious that this will be the time we find out that I have those conditions too.  I do not like taking prescriptions and therefore do not want to have to start taking them for life. 
0.785700	I'm usually worried that I'll find out something negative about my health, due to the poor choices I've made in terms of diet and exercise. 
0.571400	I would feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I am injured and worry an exam may cause more pain or if I feel there is something really unusual about my symptoms and something could be seriously wrong. Regular visits do not cause me concern.
0.285700	I don't have any anxiety when I go to the doctors office.  I usually only make appointments when necessary so I don't feel that anyone's time is wasted.  the only thing that really bugs me is when I have to wait a long time without any feedback from the front office staff.  I know that emergencies come up which throws the schedules off, but I believe that keeping patients informed is important.  If you don't let them know about a schedule change you are basically saying that their time isn't as valuable as someone else's.  so I guess this is my anxiety issue when going to the doctor. 
0.928600	I'm always treated like an unnecessary burden that they have to rush through dealing with.  I never feel like I can ask what I need to ask.
0.619000	If I am getting a pap smear, I have been hurt in the past because of carelessness. So, I almost always tense up when I am getting that done due to past trauma.
0.404800	What usually makes me nervous about going to the doctor's office is when there's something that i feel is wrong with me that's beyond a regular checkup. It doesn't really have anything to do with the doctor since it's mostly the situation that got me in to the office to begin with. But when there is something worse than usual, then everything from the wait in the waiting room and the patient room to just talking to the doctor/nurse is nervewracking
0.166700	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the long wait in the lobby and after waiting for so long, the doctor only gives you a small amount of time. That doesn't provide you enough time to ensure all questions and answers are given. 
0.857100	A doctor's demeanor and how nice or mean he will me makes me scared. It also makes me scared that they won't be able to diagnose properly.
0.714300	I am always a bit uneasy going to the doctor.  I worry that he is going to find something wrong with me.  I'd almost rather not know.
0.500000	I am getting older, and I fear that a condition is in the works that I do not know about.  I fear that something is happening right now that I won't be able to bounce back from.  
0.476200	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I have symptoms, or am suffering from an illness and have no idea what it is.  If my symptoms are extreme, sometimes I'm anxious or worried.
0.142900	I'm actually never really worried as although I don't get sick or have to go to the doctor's office often, I am confident that they will figure out the issue and get me back on track health wise, in a good amount of time. 
0.738100	What makes me the most worried is if it's something serious or not. I personally don't have health insurance so anything serious would also probably cost me a lot of money out of pocket. This is particularly worrisome as my personal income isn't that high either.
0.285700	The only thing that would make me anxious or worried is the condition that sent me to see the doctor in the first place.  I'm the sort of person who won't go to see a doctor unless I think there is something seriously wrong.  Not serious in the sense that I might think something life threatening but serious in the sense that it's something my body's defense system seems to be incapable of taking care of on it's own.
0.809500	The thought of what could be found or diagnosed. I have not had much health scares up to this point but I am aware I am getting older and things are bound to happen. Both of my parents are both still living and very healthy for the most part.
0.761900	I'm worried that my doctor won't take time to hear my concerns. Also, I am anxious about possible test results.
0.285700	I do not  feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I am confident that things will go well and that evverything will be fine and dandy after I leave the office.
0.381000	I get most anxious and worried about the bill I will receive. I have an HMO and pay $25 for PCP office visits. However, after my appointment my doctor's office will re-evaluate the co-pay and what was discussed and bill me for items that came up in conversation during an appointment. 
0.738100	I usually feel anxious that they're going to find something wrong with me than is worse than what I though.  If I have a cough, I worry it might be related to the lungs or that they may not be able to get my symptoms under control.  I worry that I'm going to be judged and this all makes me anxious and worried. 
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when I am attending these types of appointments because I am a laid back and relaxed person. I taking everything one step at a time and see no reason to stress over anything.
0.452400	There is always the risk that something could be found that was not foreseen, but on the whole this is not how I typically feel since I lead a relatively healthy lifestyle.
0.285700	Since I do not feel these emotions when visiting my primary care physician, I will describe those feelings of going to my previous dentist.  I used to have these feelings when visiting my dentist because I wasn't taking good care of my teeth. I think I don't have these feelings now is because I have taken an active role in my total healthcare.
0.285700	I don't usually feel anxious or worried. If I do it's usually when I have a rare or odd issue that I am not sure will be diagnosed.
0.285700	I don't get anxious to actually see my doctor, the only thing that may make me a little anxious is when I go to the doctor for a specific pain or something and then I worry that something may be wrong with me and I don't want to get bad news 
0.309500	I feel anxious if I am having a health issue and worried it could turn out to be something serious.  I make sure I get a thorough explanation when my health issues are being explained to me.
0.500000	I feel most worried is when the doctor finds an issue and he does not know how to treat it in the first steps. It is unknown and could be life threatening.
0.357100	I am most anxious or worried about visiting the doctor because one can never know what will be found out about my health. But this stems from the fact that I have largely avoided doctors for most of my life. If I regularly visited a doctor, then perhaps I would be less worried.
0.142900	The possibility of having some kind of surgery. I have always had a fear of having surgery and the operating table in general since I was little. 
0.595200	I feel anxious sometimes because if I need to go the doctor, something is wrong with me.  There concern over the unknown will always lead to a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor.
0.142900	If I have something new that's wrong with me and I'm already concerned, then yes, I am nervous going to the doctor, but it doesn't have anything to do with my physician. It just means I know that something is wrong and I'm nervous to find out what it is.
0.809500	I am worried that he will not believe me when I tell him my symptoms and that I will feel like a foolish old women.
0.571400	I am mostly afraid of them telling me something new is wrong that I did not know before and that I will have to start taking some new kind of medications.I can hardly afford what  I am on now even with all of my healthcare. I can only imagine what it would be like if they had to put me on more.
0.809500	I have been for several different exams and what bother me the most is, I usually know what the problem is and so does he but I dont really wanna hear what it is. The few rare times when I dont know what it is, Im worried about cost, and what I will have to do for treatment or if something new is wrong that I will have to deal with. You always have the dread of finding something new, when you think you know what is wrong, doesnt happen very often but when it does, it scares you.
0.285700	I rarely feel terribly anxious unless I am experiencing a very painful or unusual condition. If that is the case, I am most anxious about receiving a bad diagnosis.
0.142900	Having to sit on the exam table.  I'm a big guy and it is tough to get on that thing and sit.  I would rather sit in the chair.
0.523800	I'm anxious that there might be something really wrong with me like having life-threatening illness. I don't want to have something that will make me change my way of life. 
0.666700	I am concerned that the doctor may inform me that there is something seriously wrong with my health.  I am afraid of finding out about an incurable disease or health issue.
0.738100	I don't like to give details about private issues. The healthcare system seems to be set up as a referral business. The first visit is just to get a patient to go somewhere else.
0.428600	I'm anxious that my doctor might say something is off with my blood levels and or the nutrients I am recieving.
0.381000	It really depends on what I am going for.  Most recently I had to go because I was having knee pain related to an old injury.  When you go to a new dr and say you need strong pain killers some times they think you are just trying to get drugs
0.714300	With the doctor I've been using, you just never know what he will come up with. He's friendly at times and other times a real jerk. Also, he divorced his wife and married his nurse. Don't upset the Queen!! 
0.142900	I want to be able to find out what the issue is right away when I go to the dr office. I also would like to avoid a run-around with treatments that would be completely pointless and offer no remedy to whatever reason I had to visit the dr office. I also do NOT like dealing with needles, having my blood taken causes me some anxiety whenever it happens. 
0.238100	It depends on my reasoning for visiting the doctors office. If its a matter of me being really sick or something that could of been wrong at a pregnancy checkup I was very worried. I had went in a couple times only to find out I had lost the baby my future pregnancy checkups were always a huge scare and worry but as far as routine checkup it wasn't ever a problem.
0.500000	Being touched makes me highly uncomfortable and I would rather you not do that, please and thank you.
0.476200	I don't like when she rushes me.  I don't like when she does not listen to my health concerns.  It makes me anxious that something could go wrong that my doctor could simply brush off and overlook.  I often wonder about a mole on my back, which she said was benign just by looking at it.  Meanwhile she is not a dermatologist.  And she then referred me to a dr that had killed my friends father by misdiagnosing him.
0.142900	I'm most worried about how long it takes.   Generally, going to the doctor's office does not worry me
0.761900	The one thing that makes me feel the most anxious has been a couple times when doctors pushed medications instead of making sure I actually needed it.  If there are major symptoms and they don't take the time to find the source and instead just automatically try and mask a problem I feel very angry and defeated.  I've wasted time and then you have to go somewhere else.
0.428600	I think what makes me feel the most anxious is what they might find. I worry a lot about my health and always fear the unknown. 
0.190500	That my health isn't what I want it to be and that it's going to be terminal or worse. That's it really
0.428600	Usually a doctor's office is cold and this environment causes me to fell tense. Also I often forget to tell the doctor important symptoms and I become anxious when trying to remember them.
0.571400	When my doctor writes something down and doesn't mention anything about it to me. My doctor knows more about me than I do and I know nothing.
0.142900	Nothing really, maybe if they leave the examination room ans don't return for a while, I may get a little tense, thinking that something on my account is delaying their return.
0.476200	Unexpected health issues, or issues that seem minor and turn out to be much larger. I am fearful for my health as I get older so having a good examination is really important to me.
0.285700	I usually get good reports for the most part. Unknown is always worrisome. Something can happen that is unexpected and you can take things for granted. Health is always one of those things. My doctor does a good job of not keeping me in the dark about anything but you always worry about the what if. Mortality is a scary concept. Worry about what happens to my family is something goes wrong. Worry about how to pay large medical bills even though I have good insurance. No matter how prepared you think you are I don't think anything can prepare you for a very bad medical report.
0.761900	The great unknown. If I'm in the doctor's office it's because I really need to be there, and I'm usually heading out of the country or returning and something has gone wrong.
0.619000	Knowing that a doctor could give me information at any time that could change my life forever makes me a little nervous.  Or when connected to an EKG machine and they tell you not to worry--how can you not be a little nervous.  Or, waiting for a test result that seems to take forever.
0.666700	I'm anxious because you never know what the doctor is going to tell you. For example they could tell you that you will have cancer in the next moment and you wouldn't be prepared for that whatsoever. It is scary.
0.571400	Whether I wasted my time and money or if this will be one of the few times Iâm actually provided a medical solution to whatever Iâm there for. 
0.333300	Not being able to know the outcome it what makes me the most anxious worried.  The actual act of being at a doctor's office and talking with a doctor doesn't make anxious or worried, usually.
0.761900	I'm always scared because I have lots of health problems in my family history. I am always scared that something is going to come back bad or a simple ache is going to be so much more than just a simple ache. I am always worried about what they will recommend or what they have to say.
0.976200	It was just one situation while i was prgenant and i just didn't want to go because i knew i would get myself upset at what they had to tell me.
0.690500	I am worried about something being wrong with me that i am not aware of. I am worried about unexpected medical expenses. 
0.452400	Hardly ever but sometimes i will think the doctor is going to tell me that there is something more that is wrong with me.
0.476200	it would be only when my doctor is not there and i would have to deal with another doctor that i don't really trust or know to much 
0.142900	I'm worried about the cost of a prescription or care. Healthcare here in America is very expensive. Right now I'm luckily on my parents' insurance, because I simply cannot afford my own as an individual. Once that time is up, and if I get sick or injured, I'm screwed. One of the biggest causes of bankruptcy in this country is due to healthcare bills.
0.690500	I feel more anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I never know what they may find. It is an uneasy feeling going in and having to wait and see what may possibly be wrong with you. It makes me overall nervous and my blood pressure rises a bit when I go to the doctor's because of fear of the unknown. What also makes me most anxious is the kind of tests they may have to do or if I have to get a shot, or blood drawn.
0.666700	Just afraid that they will find something that is not good. I haven't really taken care of my body from like 12 to 22 using heroin and doing whatever drugs I could get my hands on. Just the past three years I got my life otgether and my health is phenomonal. But I am worried I will have something go wrong with my brain because I have had two traumatic brain injuries. I don't want the doctor to tell me I have brain cancer
0.571400	What makes me feel worried is that they will quickly prescribe meds and will give you no inside depth to how you can truly take care of yourself by keeping your body in an alkaline state to fight off diseases and ailments.
0.357100	The part that makes me most anxious is the time that I have to wait. :-)  Other than that, I feel like I am being very well taken care of and preventative care is important for all - I try to maintain my health.
0.904800	I am always afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I absolutely fear having something serious and needing surgery or some horrible disease like cancer.  It's terrifying for me to visit even if it's just for a cold.  
0.261900	It's probably a dumb reason, but her hands are very cold. She's a tiny woman and being in a doctor's office all day doesn't help her warm up. She apologizes, but that makes me a little anxious. If I had recently been ill, I also feel a little anxious about my lab results. I don't get many colds or the flu, but when I do I feel very sick. That makes me think there might be some other problem, but so far it's not been very serious. 
0.571400	I guess the uncertainty of your health is what makes me the most anxious. It really worries me that I don't truly know if I'm fully health even If I feel healthy.
0.738100	I don't know what they are going to do to me, if something will be painful, or what the results of any tests might be. I tend to not think about my health too much but then when I go to the doctor suddenly I have to deal with it all
0.690500	Due to the fact Iâve already had 9 surgeries on my shoulder Iâm always worried I might need more. Iâm only 25 and Iâve had 3 shoulder transplants so it always makes anxious when I go.
0.809500	I'm getting older. I always feel my body deteriorating and I'm just always scared something new is going to pop up. I'm not a hypochondriac, yet I do worry about my health because it really isn't very good. 
0.738100	I feel anxious and also worried about what results will come from the doctors evaluation.  Although I know deep in my mind nothing severe should be wrong I also know there is a chance that something may come back that would make my health even worse than it currently is.  
0.214300	The only thing that worries me is that I might have something seriously wrong with me. Since I had a life-threatening illness about 10 years ago --involving my heart- this isn't an unreasonable fear.
0.571400	Nothing makes me feel anxious more than just having to wait in the waiting room. It seem unnecessary to have an appointment at a certain time then be force to wait another 30 minutes or so. Can be very frustrating when they do this at the office. I get anxious because I could have been doing better things with my time then spending it at a waiting room. This waiting time feeds into my anxiety, but most of the time I feel like I am in the clear, and have no issues I should be worried about since I get tested every three months.
0.142900	The only thing I get worried about is that I am going to forget to tell the Dr. something or not be able to communicate correctly.
0.571400	Probably just fear of the unknown.  While I'm healthy in general, you never know what might happen or what tests may show to the doctor that you are not even aware about.
0.142900	Obviously there is always that sense of the unknown. That is to say that any normal routine issue can snowball into something much worse. It's impossible to tell with utmost certainty what is happening within our bodies at any given moment but I suppose that's all the more reason we need to take care of ourselves as best as we can.
0.738100	It is always the test results. They give me so much anxiety, it makes me nervous and I even start shaking sometimes.
0.714300	"What makes me most anxious and worried is not knowing the doctor personally enough so that you know whether or not they have your best interest in mind on that particular day.  I think like anyone off that doctors can have ""off"" days."
0.452400	What makes me anxious about visiting a dr. appointment is the wait. I see and hear sick people and worry Im going to get what they have. I also feel uncomfortable being in a confined space with people that I know are sick
0.285700	I always worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. Its not the doctor herself that makes me worry, just the thought that one day she might tell me I have cancer or something.
0.500000	I generally do not get too worried or anxious about anything.  What is, is.  If a problem reveals itself, I will tackle it head on.  Worrying gets you nowhere.
0.666700	I feel the most anxious and or worried if the Doctor may give me different results that I was hoping for, for some unexpected reason, that's why I am always trying to imagine the worst case scenario.
0.285700	My blood pressure. I always worry that it's going to start spiking. It doesn't though, so I am mostly worrying about nothing.
0.476200	Doctor's offices and hospitals in general are never fun places to be, it's where people go when they are sick or hurt or dying.  Really not a whole lot of positive connotations there. Also, there's always an irrational fear the doctor is going to stick you with needles or tell you you have cancer or whatever.
0.190500	I think it is the diagnosis itself. My mind goes to a bad place for a bit thinking of the what ifs and the problems I have been having. My grandfather died of cancer 2 years ago because his doctor wasn't thorough and didn't catch the cancer at all. My mind always goes to that instance and I wish it didn't. I don't feel a ton of anxiety but it's enough to make me think back to what happened to my grandfather. I don't want that to be me.
0.190500	Any medical appointment makes me a little anxious simply because I will have to bare myself and be uncomfortable. The only time I get worried is if I suspect that there may really be something wrong that may not turn out well.
0.690500	That they are judging me. I just get so anxious that most of the time I won't tell them certain things because I'm embarrassed.
0.666700	The unknown makes me nervous.  Not my doctor.  I know that he will figure something out, but its the process of getting to that solution and the waiting to get in, or wanting to know that he can fix whatever is wrong.
0.285700	The results of a test i might have to take would make me feel very anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.
0.261900	About the only thing that makes me anxious or worried is when they take my blood pressure. It always tests high for some reason and is disturbing to both the doctor and I. I do get a little anxious being around all of the germs hanging around the waiting room.
0.142900	I sometimes get nervous that I will get sick while I am there. If I am going to puke I would prefer to do it in the comfort of my own home.
0.666700	I get nervous that the doctor will scrutinize my health. I do not want to here things that I know, like drinking less pop or eating less carbs etc. I also get worried they may find some serious health complication that will upend my life.
0.571400	I worry that there might be something wrong with me and that I would need to get more tests done or even surgery and I worry what me family will do if I am not able to help as much as I have a son to support. 
0.452400	I most worry about how I am going to pay for the doctor bill AND the prescription they are likely to prescribe. It seems that everything requires a new medicine.
0.238100	I always get somewhat anxious when visiting the doctors because of all the germs and sick people there presently or before me. I always sit furtherest away from people as possible and hand sanitize to restrict the spread of illness as much as possible. As far as the actual visit, it's not that bad it's just the germs and illness I am weary of. 
0.333300	I would only be anxious or worried if there was a new problem that required tests and a wait for results to find out if there was something to be concerned about.
0.285700	I am afraid that I might be diagnosed with cancer since I smoke.  My mother had lung cancer.  She died two years ago.
0.357100	I am sometimes anxious because they may find out something that is wrong with me that I am unaware of. Going to the doctor is just is a stressful thing.
0.333300	That I may have some dread disease that cannot be cured or will take a log of treatments to cure.  That the chronic condition that I have has gotten worse or something is prescribed that I cannot accomplish
0.333300	It feels kind of impersonal and condescending to be sitting there feeling as though you are being talked down to most of the time, or like you have 15 minutes of this doctor's time and then he's moving on. Being on display makes me feel anxious.
0.333300	I feel a little worried about the possibility of the doctor finding a chronic disease that is not curable or treatable.  I also feel anxious that I may not be in as good health as the last physical exam.
0.857100	I am worried that they will find something bad. I am very anxious about my health and am always worried that something major is going to turn up no matter how unlikely that is. I also get worried about pain such as from shots. 
0.666700	I just tend to worry that there may be something wrong with me. My family has had a history of heart and cancer issues, and I always fear that one of those, or something else entirely will affect me at some point.
0.142900	I usually just worry that things are going to be worse than they actually are. Usually, it turns out to be the opposite, but still. The not know or that feeling that something might actually be really bad is what worries me the most. Sometimes things get in my head that I can't seem to shake off.
0.714300	If I have something wrong with me that has been bothering me for a while I am concerned about what the cause may be. I worry that the doctor may find something considerably wrong. I worry that the doctor may run a test that will have a very bad result.
0.261900	It is the waiting time when you get to the office. Getting right in would make me feel less anxious there since I am getting in and learning of any issues as soon as I get there. 
0.857100	It mostly isn't  a conscious thing, I just get this feeling of dread from being in hospitals even if I am not the one being treated, I don't really know why. but weighing myself causes anxiety because i am really fat and I know that the doctor is going to bring it up (which is their job so I am not saying it is wrong). I also have anxiety about my health so I am always nervous that they are going to find something wrong with me. Also if I am being honest there is an inferiority complex going on, doctors are successful and even though I know it's just in my head there is a feeling like the doctor is looking at me like I am a looser.
0.619000	When visiting the doctor, I am always aware of the possibility that something I considered a minor issue may seem more serious to my doctor and lead to a diagnosis of an urgent health issue. 
0.285700	The concern on something being actually wrong with me. Being sick is the concern that makes me not want to go to the doctor and self access myself via web md.
0.738100	I get anxious sometimes believing the doctor is going to tell me something negative about my health. I also stress out about having some medical procedure that will cost me out of pocket money, for some outrageous medical bill I will receive. 
0.476200	I am most anxious when there's a time that the doctor takes a long time giving me a diagnosis of my condition one time, for some reason it made me very worried and fortunately, the results were not bad compared to what I was imagining.
0.571400	just been to so many doctors feel more worn out and tired of all the appointments. there have been times i've been worried but i don't have the energy anymore for much worry. 
0.642900	I do not feel that anxious or worried most of the time. But sometimes, I feel anxious which I think is very normal. I usually feel anxious or worried if the symptoms is something new. I am especially worried if I have my exams coming soon. I get worried about how long will I be sick, missing important class, not being able to do well in the class. Sometimes I get worried if the disease will last for a long time.
0.595200	If i really don't know whats going on and I end up in the doctors office I'm just hoping it avoids a surgery or something. If I think they cant provide me with what I need and I have to get forwarded to another doctor I may get a little anxious or worried about my next visit. Going to the doctor isn't very fun.
0.357100	Not knowing the answers are my worst fear. I feel like I want to know my results now even though sometimes that is impossible.
0.190500	The most nerve-wracking part of visiting the doctor's office is the potential that something serious is wrong; but, otherwise, I do not experience a strong anxiety about actually seeing the doctor. 
0.142900	I would feel anxious if i had blood work or sometime of test . Say a disease test , They werent able to provide me with results over the phone, Made me go to the office 
0.833300	A diagnosis that i was not expecting or finding out that ive put off treatment for so long and it's worse that I thought
0.381000	what makes me the most worried when visiting my doctors office is that a necessary test or screening may be missed or a wrong result may occur from a test.
0.666700	I worry about problems I have no control over. I have had problems with my blood pressure in the past and I worry that my blood pressure will be high again. I worry that some other problem that I am unaware of will be noticed. 
0.404800	I just don't want anything to be wrong with me.  I have a husband and two little boys and worry somewhat that something major will be wrong that we won't be able to fix.
0.571400	I feel really anxious when I visit my doctor because I just want to get done with my doctor appointment as fast a possible. 
1.000000	Most likely it's basically because I have never liked being physically touched and also because I have a fear that they will find something seriously wrong. I also don't want someone telling me that I have to change my way of doing things and I absolutely don't like being lectured to.
0.809500	There is just something about a doctor's office that is a little unnerving that I can't quite put my finger on. Everything seems a little too perfect, and I almost feel like if there's something wrong that I'm disappointing the physician or making their life harder.
0.428600	I am sometimes worried that she will judge my life choices or tell me that I am seriously sick. I once had a doctor fat shame me. 
0.309500	I feel anxious being left in a cold room by myself for too long. It leaves me too much time to think and make myself worried
0.714300	There is always fear that the Doctor might bring news of terminal illness that might be afflicted with. So that fear of bad news is what make me anxious and worried.
0.214300	Not knowing how unpleasant the treatment/examination might be. Also I might receive bad news. That bad news might raise the possibility of pain, suffering and unpleasant treatments.
0.595200	I worry about what the diagnosis might be, and I worry about my health issues. I also tend to be anxious about how the doctor might treat me as a person, or how they will explain things in a way i might understand and be honest with me. 
0.285700	Not too much makes me concerned when I am at the doctors office. i dont go very often but when I do it's usually not for a major issue, its just because its time to check up on my health so usually I am not worried. If there is something going on that brings me in that might make me a little anxious, especially if I have to get tests done because I dont get the results right away.
0.142900	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is not knowing whether something serious is happening or not. I fear the worst but am unable to see whether it is true or not.
0.928600	I'm always wondering what is the doctor gonna find. I lost a parent to cancer at a young age so I always think I'm going to get a cancer diagnosis.
0.190500	I tend to google things a lot (big no-no) whenever I feel exceptionally bad, or have something weird going on physically, so that tends to create a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. I assume the worst. 
0.690500	I have a mechanical aortic valve, a dacron aortic aneurysm replacement, and a pacemaker.  The valve and graft are twelve years old, and my second pacemaker is 7 years old.  I worry the most that my valve will need to be replaced again, and that my pacemaker needs replacement again.  These things have a limited life, and I know that at some point problems that arise will need to be addressed.
0.904800	I am most worried about what diagnosis they are going to give me and what I am going to do about it.
0.238100	I get most anxious when waiting for a blood tests or physical exams.  I don't worry about the doctor, I worry about what could be wrong with me.
0.428600	That he might find something I didn't know what was wrong with me.Or that I might need a shot. those things scare that crap out of me.
0.285700	I don't know if it will be good news or bad news when something is wrong with me. What if it is something serious but it makes me worried if he just ignores it or does not take it seriously. I just normally get anxious because sometimes you just don't know what it is your'e going to expect.
0.166700	I think the doctor might not understand my condition. I also think that they may rush to quickly to conclusions or not fully recognize what is going on.
0.571400	That the doctor is going to find something very wrong with me.  I worry that if I am sick that I might have a serious illness. 
0.714300	You never know what to expect when you go into an appointment. Usually you are going because something doesnât feel right in your body and that worries you. With the internet nowadays you can always look up the worst case scenarios and no matter how hard you try the thought of the worst is always in your head. This scares a lot of people before they go to visit the doctor and that sometimes includes me
0.738100	Sometimes I have fear before entering the doctor's office in terms of finding a health complication that I didn't know I had before.  Usually, these examinations end well for me. 
0.619000	That a test will turn up something (I've had 2 different types of cancer). I have had more than my share of being told I need surgery and being quite frightened by the diagnosis so those feelings from those times tend to crop up.
0.142900	The only thing that makes me anxious about seeing a doctor is that they will recognize a problem that I did not know existed. But that is why you see a competent physician.
0.714300	What makes me most anxious whenever I visit any doctor's office is uncertainty. When going to see a doctor, one never knows what may potentially arise in terms of a negative diagnosis. Thus, I am always a little bit on edge every time.
0.357100	I don't believe they have the truth. They have strayed from true health care. Prevention is key. Not pills to treat symptoms. 
0.381000	In general, my health has been good, so I usually don't fear healthcare visits.  This may change as I get older.
0.571400	The anxiety from visiting a doctor's office comes from the worry that the doctor will tell me I have a serious medical problem rather than something trivia and temporary. There is also the dread about entering a hospital even to see the doctor.
0.357100	What makes me feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit is usually just my condition, hoping that it isn't something super serious or expensive to fix. Needles also make me uncomfortable, but they are a necessary evil at times.  
0.357100	I am anxious about possibly being seek, or needing a treatment. Usually I go visit during routine checkups, I am not very anxious about those. When I go when I do not feel too good, I worry about finding out if I will need a treatment. I also do not like needles, so if I have to get a shot, I feel anxious. 
0.571400	I am just worried they will comment on something that will make me uncomfortable. I once had a Dr yell at me about my pulse rate but this was after the receptionist told me my insurance was canceled. I panicked but it was a clerical error on her part and was quickly fixed. My heart was racing and I hadnât fully calmed down yet. 
0.452400	I had a past medical history where a mysterious illness wrecked me and spent a month in the ICU, 2 weeks in a coma. So when I feel like something is wrong again, its hard to not have a bit of anxiety or worries. However when I'm at the doctor's office, I guess its mostly just being judged about poor life decisions. 
0.666700	I feel theyâre give me the same answers all the time and donât really listen or my issues. The doctor doesnât give me their best opinion and advise. They say itsuptometodecide. Iâd like to know what they think. Thatâs why I paid to go see them. 
0.571400	The only thing that really gives me any problems is thinking about the unknown and the possiblity that there could be something wrong with me that i don't know about.  This presents a small level of anxiety and fear that there could be something that is not good. 
0.523800	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. On the contrary, I want to find an answer to why I feel so bad, or something that will help me. Unfortunately, my concerns go largely ignored.
0.619000	Just the act of going to see the doctor.  There's sick people everywhere, the office is usually cold, especially in the examination room..  You often have to wait alone in the exam room for a few minutes which increases anxiety..  Shots aren't too bad, but it's still a needle so those suck..
0.714300	I'm always worried that I have some serious medical condition.  I'm a hypochondriac, and I think what worries me most is being diagnosed with some horrible condition that I've never heard of.  Also, I have a bit of a fear of needles.  I'd hate to be surprised by having to take a blood test.
0.809500	That the condition I'm experiencing may require surgery or some other drastic, or painful measure. Since there's a family history and particular diseases that people with my ethnicity, and men over a certain age experience  (prostate cancer)  I fear that I may have it too. I guess to put it simple, it's the uncertainty and the fact that with certain conditions there's really nothing a patient can do to change the situation. On regular checkups, experiencing a cold or something like that  I'm not as worried since I have had many in my lifetime. I do, however, hate needles so I get antsy when I know I have to get  a shot.
0.595200	unnecessary tests and procedures make me nervous. I don't like to have anything done that I do not feel I need.
0.619000	I am worried about what will be found when they examine me, if it's something serious or not. I'm worried about the cost, and I'm worried about being judged for my weight. I'm usually very anxious about all of these things. 
0.333300	I really dont have any anxiousness at any of my doctors office visits usually. The only time there is anxiousness is if my doctor orders bloodwork to be done. While the procedure itself is easy, the before hand is what gets me anxious. 
0.381000	I do not like to visit the doctor because even when there is nothing wrong they try to medicate you to death.  It seems like they are just looking for a reason to give you all kinds of medicine that is not really needed.
0.381000	I get anxious because i'm always afraid that they are going to tell me that something  is wrong and need to change something. 
0.452400	I guess just worrying that something will turn up. That the doctor will find something that is very bad. I would say that is mostly what I worry about.
0.142900	The things that could make me most anxious is that i am always pressed for time. The majority of the time when i go to the doctor it is a all day experience because the doctors office is so busy. SO i worry that i wont get out of there  on time to finish my day. I could also worry that there could be something wrong with me that is not fixable.
0.309500	I normally don't feel anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. One way I would feel worried is if I was experiencing great pain and had to go to the doctors office in order to stop that pain. I generally remain calm and don't expect to find anything too wrong with myself.
0.642900	If I'm having symptoms or there's been a change in my condition since my last visit, I worry that something's wrong with me. I worry that it could be serious and that it could be expensive. I don't have a lot of money for healthcare.
0.523800	I worry that he may uncover unknown ailments that could create new life challenges, or exacerbate the ones already experienced from being a type 1 diabetic.
0.738100	I always know there will be a conversation about my weight.  What makes me most anxious though is my blood pressure.  It always reacts when I'm in the doctor's office.  I've tried breathing exercises, visualization, hydrating well and distraction.  They work to a certain extent in calming me down but aren't 100% successful.  It's so annoying!  (My blood pressure is fine everywhere else but the office).  They know me well enough that they take an initial pressure and come back 10 minutes later after I've relaxed.  Totally a psychological response.
0.261900	I am always worried about two things primarily. When I enter a doctor's office, and sometimes even before, I am slowed down by the thought of the total cost of the visit. I find it very taxing to my patience that I get charged for my visit to the center, and then I get charged for my doctor's time AND THEN I get charged for my prescription. This is all of course assuming you pay the school's insurance fee which is far higher than the govt marketplace plans available to the public. The second worry I have going in is that whatever I am scheduled to have checked out will be worse than I thought. I have an acute worry that if I go check myself up the doctor will tell me oodles of things that are wrong with me, which sounds scary honestly. I suppose the second reason also ties into extra bills.
0.333300	Doctors cannot always explain what is wrong with you when you feel sick.  My brother had a serious medical condition that his doctors did not understand.  They ran a number of rests but never really understood why he was sick.
0.190500	I am most anxious about visiting a doctor's office when I have a problem related to my heart. I am worried it might be something serious.
0.214300	I worry they might find something wrong with me that is incurable. Something like cancer. Also waiting around for long periods of time will sometimes make me anxious.
0.642900	I do not like the doctors office because its always full of sick people. I do not want to make my health worse by compromising it. I also believe that doctors try to push pills on to people and get incentives for it.
0.666700	I'm afraid that they will give me bad news. I'm afraid of getting sick in the future so I feel nervous.  
0.476200	I am worried that they will find something wrong with me. I don't want to be told I have high blood pressure, or something wrong with my blood work. So it makes me nervous to go. 
0.619000	If I'm seeing a doctor for a specific problem (rash or cold or pain), I think it's normal to worry about what they might find. As a general rule, going to the doctor for check-ups doesn't bother me, though I do worry they'll find something wrong sometimes.
0.190500	I usually worry that they will not be able to hear the baby's heart beat.  After that I worry that they will come too soon or that I didn't take care of them well enough in utero.  It's hard to know that all is okay until they are here.
0.285700	i'm not usually worried when i go to the doctor. i'm a fairly healthy person and i can usually get a prescription to take care of anything that's going on. 
0.285700	NOthing.  I really dont require a lot of personal space or require any privacy as far as my body is concerned so I really don't care what she needs to do.  I'm also super healthy so I'm never ther for anything too crazy
1.000000	Everything.  What if I catch something while I'm there?  What if the thing I'm going to the doctor about is 10 or 100 times worse than I thought?  It's horrible.  What if they find something I wasn't even expecting?  So much worry for something that could maybe be handled at home.
0.238100	I hate the blood pressure cuff. I always get really nervous when they put the cuff on me and I have to sit there while my blood pressure gets taken. Because I get so nervous, my reading is very high.
0.690500	I always have a fear in the back of my mind that I may receive life changing news. I have had surgery a couple of times in the past and so I tend to think of the worst case scenario. My worry tends to play tricks on my mind and make any form of pain seem worse than it may be.
0.547600	I am just uncomfortable being in a doctors office and having them exam you and touch you. When I think there is something wrong with me sometimes I am concerned they are going to think I am crazy, and there isn't anything wrong, or maybe there really will be something wrong. Just being in the doctors office gives you that feeling of what are they going to find.
0.309500	"I dislike having anything ""invasive"" like a papsmear, but that's probably me (and most people), and does not reflect on my doctor."
0.142900	i don't have these feelings at the DR's . I always feel comfortable there because we have a high level of mutual trust.
0.714300	My main worry is that the doctor will not be there.  In the past 12 months I have been to my appointment each month only to have the doctor on vacation 2 of those times and one time no one was there and the door was locked.  I don't worry about what he may tell me I only worry that I wont be able to get my Rx's filled.
0.642900	A few things. I get anxious because I'm not sure I'll be able to express all of my concerns, because I'm worried they won't take my concerns seriously or will dismiss them, and because I might leave without any answers (because they don't know what is wrong). I also get anxious when talking to people anyway, and doctors are worse than most people. They are busy and I worry about taking up their time. My symptoms are weird. I'm afraid I'll just look crazy.
0.785700	I tend to feel anxious when I visit the doctor because as much as I like my doctor, I do not like going to the doctor. I am always worried that I will get bad news or a bad diagnosis of health
0.809500	The Doctor finding something very wrong, either cancer or something caused by my diabetes. I don't want to leave my family at a young age 
0.857100	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when I go to the doctor is knowing that I will probably leave with some sort of mind altering medication. I have bipolar 1. That can not be treated with therapy alone. I hate my medications and the side effects of them. I almost died because of the medications that I was given about a year or so ago. I am now horrified to try anything new when it come to medication. Though it does stop certain moods, it turns me into a vegetable that can barley function. 
0.142900	Nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried when I'm visiting the doctor. I know I'm there to get checked out and I'll take the next step as it comes. 
0.714300	The doctor looking at my body makes me self conscious and I'm worried that when they're talking to me I'll look dumb
0.785700	I'm extremely private and modest. I don't like having to disrobe in front of him. It makes me feel completely awkward and uncomfortable - like I'm being judged.
0.595200	What makes me most anxious is that I feel insane. Doing the same thing over and over again hoping for a different result. They keep telling me I'm fine and there's nothing wrong with me and making me waste time when I don't feel fine and need better medicine.
0.690500	Just the idea that something could be worse than it seems. Or that they'll berate me or something like that.
0.690500	Ever since my mother died of a rare neurological disease, I worry that something terrible is going to happen to me, especially in regard to my health.  It is a ridiculous fear, and one that I am trying to get over.  I worry about what could happen 
0.571400	I've always had some issues with the doctor and I have no idea why. It's bad enough my blood pressure will actual read out higher when I am at the doctors office.
0.738100	I worry about the tests.  I'm ashamed that I did not lose weight or do everything my doctor told me and that I'd disappoint them.
0.809500	Finding out that something is wrong with my health and that I will have a short while to live or that perhaps my lifestyle choices will have taken a significant toll on my body and state of health.
0.166700	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctor.  The only thing I could say may be a factor is just uncertainty about having a serious issue, but this is not typically how I think.
0.881000	Doctors have a strong and conservative mindset. They are not flexible. They can not look past the main concern and focus on something else. In my personal case, doctors can't look past my weight issues. Even though I have an entirely different medical concern that is not related to weight, they keep focusing on weight. I am also anxious because I do not like physical exams, I do not like to be completely honest because they judge you regardless.
0.785700	The single thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the fear of being diagnosed with something that I had no idea I had. I am always scared that when Iâm doing a check up theyâll find something wrong with me, but I know it is better they find it sooner rather than later.
0.738100	I just don't like the entire experience even though I know that most doctors are there to help and they really care but I don't like tests and being probed and don't like the possibility of them finding something bad.
0.309500	When I am being given shots. Since I was a child I have had a phobia of needles and do not enjoy when I need one. I understand they are important, but I still don't like them.  
0.428600	I worry that something out of the ordinary will be discovered, and that I'll have some problem that I don't even know about.
0.928600	I have anxiety regularly, but I also hate being the sole focus in any situation. Plus, I don't like exposing myself due to a childhood trauma. I am sure that my distrust of my PCP adds to his anxiety. 
0.714300	I get anxious during the waiting time, I worry about the results of exams and tests I may have or need and discussions about things that may be wrong with me
0.666700	What makes me feel anxious when I am visiting the doctor is wondering what my health problem is. There could be some kind of underlying issue that could be very serious and you don't know until you are actually checked out by the doctor.
0.142900	I have had unexplained pain a few times and I have been nervous wondering what it could be prior to going. I felt anxious to have tests done and get results in case it was bad news. I never felt scared to speak with my doctor though.
0.333300	"Well I'm usually pregnant and towards the end of the pregnancy they ""check"" you for dilation. I just hate that. And I hate pap smears too, which are similar in uncomfortable feeling."
0.714300	"It's that stupid adage of ""What you don't know, won't hurt you"". I know it is bad to think such, but it is scary knowing that something is wrong. I often don't go to doctors until i need to out of fear that they will find something."
0.547600	It usually is what the doctors decision is. I am always worried about something serious. At my age things can go bad. 
0.381000	Uncertainty is what would bother me the most. The uncertainty of if something is wrong and what to do if there is something wrong. 
0.714300	I'm worried but also curious, if they will find something and worried they may make a wrong choice for me.
1.000000	I consider myself a hypochondriac so when I got to the doctor I sit there imagining all the things that could be wrong with me.
0.857100	For one thing having an appointment at a certain time and then having to wait and wait.  Then when you finally see the doctor he spends very little time with you.  I get anxious about the outcome of my visit and what he will find.  My blood tends to rise a bit in this instance.
0.238100	i feel most anxious about what could be wrong with me i also dont like no knowing and waiting for awhile im a generally anxious person so when it comes to public events i just am not in my overall comfort zone
0.238100	When I first go in, I am worried about possibly having something that wont easily be found and treated properly.
0.142900	I don't usually get worried.  there was a time when I had my self convinced that I had ovarian cancer.  I went to the doctor to talk to her about it.  That day I was worried, but it wasn't anything about my actual doctor that gave me anxiety. It was me self-diagnosing myself that had me all worked up. 
0.857100	What makes me feel most anxious and worried is the fact I may not get the proper help I want. Sometimes doctors fail to understand what I am experiencing and I end up not getting much help.
0.452400	I think going to the doctor, in general, gives me a little anxious feeling.  Whether you are going because of a problem or a regular examination, the feeling of wonder about what he/she will say about your health is definitely present.
0.642900	You never know what your results are going to show so that can be nerve wracking. But also being examined fully by someone you donât know very well is just uncomfortable 
0.500000	I think its just going to the doctor that makes me anxious  I dont like going to the doctor because I am afraid something will be wrong and illl have to do all these tests
0.857100	Knowing that you don't have all the information, you need to basically take their word even if they aren't telling you the whole picture, and that you don't know what the outcome will be of certain medical procedures until after the fact.
0.714300	Well I consider myself rather poor so I always worry about my doctor finding some kind of condition I have , that would be very costly to cure. So basically I am afraid of the money I will have to spend. 
0.404800	I would be most anxious about something being wrong with me in general. My family has many hereditary health and autoimmune problems and I have a few myself. Several members of my family have also had cancer while young and I have shown some signs of potentially developing two types of cancer in the past. I am moderately concerned and worried about the possibility of developing cancer while relatively young like several relatives. I am anxious in general about talking about myself and having myself touched by another person. I have general anxiety and just don't really like talking to people much, especially about myself.
0.357100	I'm often worried that my health may have deteriorated since my last visit. May blood pressure or weight may have gone up, or some other medical condition may have arisen.
0.642900	I don't really know what it is, I don't think it is the doctor themselves, but rather just the entire experience. I go to a hospital when I am not feeling well, so in my head, everyone is wondering what is wrong with me or why I am there. Plus, I do not want to have a time where I go to the doctor and something is very wrong with me. 
0.476200	I don't know if I will be there for an hour, waiting. If I have tests I would be anxious about the results. 
0.595200	I'm always afraid they won't take my concerns seriously, that they think I'm over-exaggerating my symptoms. I've had a doctor flat out tell me I was wrong even though I knew I was correct and it led to a fear that I just won't be listened to. 
0.428600	What makes me feel most anxious when I am at a doctor's office is when I have to take an eye exam, because I feel they never give me sufficient time to focus on what lens is better when I'm getting tested.
0.547600	I'm not sure what makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, maybe it's the possibility of having to do more tests.
1.000000	I get really nervous around people in authority in general.  Add that to a situation where a person in authority is asking me all about myself what my daily life entails and it makes me extremely nervous even though I trust and respect my doctor. 
0.333300	My main concern and cause of anxiety is the worry that my actual illness is serious. I'm very rarely thinking about or distrusting the doctor or healthcare provider instead.
0.571400	I wouldn't want the doctor to find something negative. Also, the cost deters me from going to the doctor. Medical expenses are so exorbitant that I don't like to go to the doctor if I feel like I can avoid it.
0.357100	The thing that makes me the most anxious is going in to see the doctor for something minimal and finding out that it was a serious problem. I still remember the time I went to the doctor with my mother to get her checked up and during the time she thought it would be a good idea for me to get checked out too. When we went there the nurse said that everything was fine with my mother so I felt relieved but when she went to my results she had said I had a few traces of kidney stones in me. I began to worry because I always saw myself as very healthy but she reassured me it wasn't that big of a deal.
0.404800	I already suffer from a panic disorder with anxiety so I tend to be anxious anytime I go out in public, whether it is for a doctor appointment or not. However there are certain factors that make me worry. If it is just a physical or a normal scheduled appointment then I do not worry so much. But if I am going in to get an injury looked at then I tend to worry about permanent damage. When I was a teenager I suffered rhabdomyolysis. I was very alarmed and it required a long hospital stay. I would get worried after I got out of the hospital because they were sure if  I would get full use of my limb after it healed.
0.214300	I get the most anxious in expecting a negative outcome. Aside from that I am not really anxious or worried at all about visiting the doctor's office.
0.809500	I am very overweight and I'm always worried that doctor's will disregard me or judge me when they see my size and weight. I'm very self conscious about my weight and body type, and I also worry that doctor's will just see me as a problem due to my weight. 
0.714300	I think that most people walking into a doctor's office, even if they look and feel healthy, are anxious and worried about being diagnosed with something terrible. Just a few years ago I thought that I was quite healthy and was told at the age of 30 or 31 that I had very high cholesterol and had to start taking prescription medication to address the problem.  Every time I go to the doctor I'm worried that I might learn of a similar problem.
0.523800	The unknown, not knowing if what health check up could turn up or progress into something worse or more intense. Anxiety hits everyone, and just going to one would incur a little bit of worry or doubt when getting checked out and evaluated.
0.238100	Going to the doctor is like taking your car to the mechanic. There could always be something seriously wrong that will require time and money to fix. In this case, my health is the most important, so of course I am concerned the doctor would find something bad under my hood.
0.833300	I do not like to be exposed to other people's germs in the waiting room.  If I have something other than a routine condition, I often feel worried about the unknown.
0.738100	i am always worried that the doctor would tell me i have cancer or some other awful disease . the worst case  scenario is always in the back of my mind, im often a little anxious at the doctors office.i worry also about catching a virus from a previous patient because alot of people who go to the doctors office are very sick.
0.571400	I feel like everyone nowadays ends up with cancer or some other huge disease, even when symptoms aren't present. I am generally very healthy, but I do worry about the doctor finding something abnormal that may not have presented symptoms. I like to be in control and have a fear of the unknown. 
0.285700	I usually don't feel much anxious when visiting the doctor's office. Maybe because I used to visit the doctor's office when I was a child. The past experiences sometimes may make me a little anxious.
0.595200	I worry that there will be something wrong with me, something that will cost a lot of money to fix and I would not be able to cover the medication or procedure. I do not going to hospitals in general so that does not help my situation at all.
0.690500	I do not feel comfortable going to the doctor's office. Health issues make me feel tense and anxious. I am not sure about the reason. Probably is the possibility of finding something new about my health.
0.142900	I feel anxious and worried when I have to go and something is wrong that I can't figure out pretty much by myself because my mother died from multiple myeloma. It was not found until she was stage 4. So I am always anxious whe I have to wait for lab results.
0.666700	I am generally in good health so I don't need to visit the doctor's often.  When I do, it's usually for something that has me quite worried so it's just that.
0.761900	I think it's just the idea that, while I may be there for one thing, they may find something else wrong with me. The idea that all the care I take to be healthy and to make sure I am well might mean nothing because my body might betray me in a way I have little control over. 
0.357100	Other than a routine physical the older i get the more i worry that there will be something wrong. I feel that the older i get the more i work to maintain a better state of health. In an emergency i am generally fearful of what the doctor is going to say.
0.595200	It makes me anxious that they may find something severely wrong with me and it will change my life. Or that they will misdiagnosed something and it will affect my well being. 
0.357100	I might get bad news or something unforeseen will rise and i might not be able to handle it. The thought of getting cancer has always frightened me. Even getting a dangerous virus has always scared me.
0.523800	I think the scariest thing is not knowing what the result of your test are going to be. Even if you feel super healthy and you are living a healthy lifestyle nobody can be 100% sure that they are healthy 
0.476200	I think that all people who go to a medical practice feel the same as me. Perhaps the patient goes with a slight abdominal discomfort and in the consultation discovers that it was not something so light what he felt but it was or is a serious and delicate disease. However, I recommend taking this risk and going to the doctor. That will always be the best option.
0.571400	I never know if itâs going to go okay. I have a heart condition and sometimes things look great and other times not so great. Itâs stressful and expensive. 
0.642900	I don't want the doctor to randomly tell me I've been doing something wrong, or that I have 2 months to live, or some type of cancer. All of those ideas freak me out. I don't want there to be something wrong with me. 
0.690500	I usually feel anxious and worried when I am unsure of the outcome of a diagnosis. When I am going to see a doctor for a concern with my health and I don't yet know the diagnosis, that makes me very uneasy. The other thing that makes me worried about visiting doctors, is the doctor themselves at times. Because I don't know the doctor personally and I am unsure of what type of person they are and how they maybe professional or not. 
1.000000	The doctor always takes a long time but they're always in a rush to leave. They always write things down but don't communicate. They don't make eye contact and they're always leaving and entering. 
0.428600	I guess when I go to the doctor I am scared that they will find something really bad, as I have had cervical cancer and it came back 3 times.  I try not to be negative but it just worries me.
0.142900	I usuall don't worry too much. The uncertainty of what may be found this time pops into my head but it is a minor issue.
0.690500	I am anxious because I generally don't like going to the doctor or the dentist. The place often has other sick or injured people there, which makes me anxious. The environment, while clean and sterile makes me uncomfortable. It usually involves annoying paperwork, driving to and from, checking in, and lots of waiting, which makes the experience unpleasant and anxiety inducing. Further, the uncertainty about health conditions or what might be wrong creates nervousness and anxiety.
0.381000	I just feel anxious sometimes that i may get bad news.  They may find cancer or something serious that i was not expecting that could be life changing.
0.381000	I fee anxius about visiting a doctor since i dont want any bad news, and i fear being diagnosed with something that would cost lots of money or would be deadly
0.714300	I think the fear that something might be wrong with me is the worst. The scary thing is that even if you think it's something small it might turn into something huge. I can see why people try to avoid it.
0.571400	I would be worried about how I'm going to pay for the visit, and whether the problem would turn out to be something that I would never be able to pay for. 
0.333300	Finding out from the doctor that I have medical condition is what makes me most anxious or worried.  The medical condition may require taking medicine or seeing a specialist.  I always feel relieved when I go to the doctor for a physical and it turns out that nothing is wrong with me.
0.571400	My most anxious moments at the Dr's office involve tests which have been recommended and the realization that I will not be able to pay the co-pay and deductible required for most of the needed tests.
0.809500	I seem to get very anxious when seeing my doctor because I always forget what I need to tell them. I am usually worried about what I may find out at that visit. I sometimes feel worried that the doctor may think I am a little crazy because I do not know how to explain a certain symptom. I am sure they know most of the time what the patient is talking about as they have normally seen that problem before. But with myself I am not good at explain a certain pain or feeling. But as far as actually walking in the office and talking with the staff I always feel comfortable. 
0.500000	"I am most concerned of a ""worst case scenario"" that I have built up in my head when a medical condition has become severe."
0.142900	Nothing does as I do not go to the doctors at all. If i were to go to the doctors it would be something very serious that I need to get checked out with tests, so I would be worried about whatever I was getting tested for. 
0.523800	The main thing that makes me anxious when going to the doctor is wondering if they will find something very wrong with me. I worry about ever contracting a deadly disease where it is unlikely to be cured. This reason alone is why I make sure I see my doctor for my annual checkups. I want to know well in advance if I need to get something treated. 
0.690500	I am worried sometimes when I visit that my weight will be more than the previous visit.  I am worried to he get onto me possibly about the weight.  I am worried that the blood work could show some issues like high cholesterol.  I am worried that the blood test could show high liver levels which could be fatty liver. I am worried my blood pressure could be elevated.  The blood pressure maybe just elevated during that time because I am nervous about our visit.  Usually tho I feel very comfortable with my Dr.  
0.904800	When I see one of my specialists I am afraid she will find that something is wrong and that I will require surgery.  I have already had four of them for a medical condition I have.  She is a great, caring doctor but the fear of the unknown is the worst part.  I have an anxiety disorder as well so that makes the experience even worse.
0.523800	I know there is always the chance of bad news. I do not put my self in the expectative state of mind, but I am aware of the possibility.
0.452400	I worry that he will find something wrong with me that I am not aware of.  I get a little anxious when he runs tests and I am not sure why he feels they are needed.  I don't like the explanation that he runs them for all patients in my age group.  I understand that he is pro-active, but sometimes it worries me.
0.785700	I am worried about making sure to resolve whatever issue I have come in for. I am worried about my insurance working properly. I am anxious about what questions the doctor will ask.
0.523800	The unknown is what worries me.  It's the idea of the doctor finding something wrong that could be potentially serious and leads to a bad outcome regardless of what a doctor can do.
0.238100	If I am not feeling well not knowing what is causing me to feel ill makes me anxious and worried. After the prognosis and diagnosis I start to settle down and relax. 
0.142900	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is my skin appearing to be in need of hydration. I never want to appear to my doctor as being as ashy.
0.809500	"I am always concerned for surprises. I'm always afraid that they will find something ""new"" that is wrong with me, which is disheartening, considering how many chronic conditions I have."
0.214300	What makes me feel worried is just the anticipation about whatever could be ailing me being worse than I thought it was. I would not want anything serious to happen to me in that case.
0.238100	I don't really get nervous that much. It's more about shots. I hate getting shots and i'm terrified of needles. That's really the only reason. Getting my flu shot was hell LOL.
0.881000	"I worry that the doctor will not take my concerns and thoughts seriously. I worry that I will be ignored and the doctor will think he knows what is best for me without listening to what I have to say.  I worry that the doctor will try to fit me into a ""box"" typical of other patients he treats and not treat me as an individual."
0.642900	I would hate to learn that I have a dreaded disease that I didn't know about. I would like to think that my lifestyle would keep me from having a bad disease.
0.738100	My family medical history and not very great, so I am fearful that I will get diagnosed with something. Anytime I feel less than perfectly healthy I have a small amount of concern. Being in a doctors office is often an uncomfortable experience in general.
0.261900	I worry that I come across as complaining about every little thing. I have a terrible habit of ignoring things for a long time until they become a big problem, and then going to the doctor. I decided I didn't want to do that, but now I feel as if I have been put through a ton of unnecessary testing this year because of my complaints to the doctors, and I worry that I am presenting myself as a hypochondriac
0.547600	When I have an acute problem that hasn't gone away on its own, I can feel pretty anxious. I can also feel anxious when I've been waiting for a long time.
0.976200	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is that the doctor will find something wrong with me, and that I could possibly be put on medication for the rest of my life, treating any condition instead of being able to cure it.
0.881000	Well I really can't blame the doctor for this one. I have just always felt very anxious about visiting a doctor (or dentist, for that matter). I am always fearful that they will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of, or that the visit will entail pain I don't want to deal with (such as shots, drawing blood, etc.) I wouldn't say I'm a problem patient though, it's just that I am quietly anxious about my appointments. 
0.333300	I mostly have positive feelings when a doctor is examining me because if I get a clean bill of health, then obviously, that's a positive result but even if the dr does find something wrong, I'd rather know about it so that I can do what I need to to overcome it.
0.214300	Fear of the unknown is always the scariest part. Blood work can often reveal unexpected problems. Another thing might be that there is no known way to treat a condition. 
0.142900	"While I have never really experiences the sensation of anxiety or worry when visiting a doctor or health care provider, I can definitely imagine why many people are apprehensive.  Many people are worried that the treatment may hurt or feel uncomfortable during the exam.  People may also be scared to hear the truth regarding their condition and be in a state of ""ignorance is bliss"".  These factors cause people to not only worry and become anxious, but to also not follow up or seek treatment for their condition or ailments."
0.285700	That I will need to have shots or I will hear the word cancer. I do not mind the exam and any drugs or other things I would need to do.
0.666700	I have very strong white coat anxiety. I'm not worried about the aspect of pain particularly. It's more the whole aspect of fearing for the worst coupled with the unknown drives it. Loss of control and claustrophobic feelings also factor into it some extent. The apprehension is worse with some medical professionals than it is with others. 
0.142900	I am not anxious, but I have had a biopsy before and that did cause a bit of anxiety. In that case it was just hoping that the biopsy was benign and not cancer. The anxiety stems from unknown health problems that could be present.
0.404800	I worry that they may try to push a drug on me that will end up hurting me or ruining my life. Of course, I'm very resistant to that and I would reject anything that I couldn't research before I took it. I just feel like I have to keep my guard up and make sure that I'm doing what's right for me in my understanding of things, regardless of what the doctor wants. 
0.571400	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I am relatively young and in good health, but I am always concerned that something will come up that I am not expecting. I am too anxious of a person over all, so this is really in line with my personality.
0.428600	I have had health concerns in the past and I worry about things that may come up again when I go to see the doctor.  Since I do not know what he is going to tell me, I naturally am anxious about what I am about to hear.  Those who say they are not anxious are either lying, or just ignorant about what can happen to peope as they get older.  I work in a profession that has a lot of people having health issues and these concerns travel with me when I go in to see the doctor as well.
0.761900	that i will be belittled, and my concerns wont be addressed because they will make up their mind about it with little information and dont do a full exam.
1.000000	I am very nervous about having my body violated or put through examinations that I am not consenting to. Many times doctors have forced me to succumb to treatment that I explicitly said I didn't want, so I have constant anxiety about seeing them. I have been sent away in a police car too many times by care providers that refuse to give me the treatment I need.
0.285700	There is nothing in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried. I was anxious when finding out the sex of my baby.
0.666700	Thinking if they are really up to the task and willing to devote their full attention. If not, I may end up suffering from their incompetence and the lack of work ethic.  
0.809500	I feel that sometimes when I go to the doctor, I might not get what I am looking for right away. I also fear if I can afford it or if I am diagnose with something that can hurt my health and my future. 
0.142900	I always feel like they may tell me something I dont want to hear or something thats going to be hard for me to correct. I dont like bad news and I never want to hear bad news at all
0.619000	I was always somewhat anxious about all of my prenatal visits. I had struggled with infertility and had experienced a miscarriage prior, so everything related to the pregnancy made me nervous. It wasn't specific to the doctor. 
0.309500	I just get anxiety and my chest tightens up.  I am not sure why.  I have high blood pressure and it is always worse when I visit the doctor.  
0.714300	I don't trust them.  I always feel like I'm taking a chance when I go to see them.  I always question whether anything that they want to do is appropriate.  I always assume that anything negative I've been told in a doctor's office is just a starting point, that verification of anything I've been told will require a lot of research on my part and possibly even a trip to another doctor (who will probably contradict the first doctor).  
0.142900	Going to the doctor's office can be a real source of anxiety. ... examination, then all that time sitting there is probably making you dwell on your worries 
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. The only scenario I can imagine this might happen to someone is they go to a new doctor and don't know what to expect or happen.
0.261900	The only thing that I would feel anxious about is whether the doctor is going to find something wrong with my health.I have minor kidney disease, which worries me slightly, and my mother has diabetes- so I'm uneasy about my a1c readings
0.833300	I am most anxious about the cause of the problems I'm having as well as whether or not I'm wasting money with a particular doctor who won't address the problems until other costly procedures have been completed. 
0.404800	I worry that a doctor will not fully understand my pain or symptoms. I feel anxious about being overprescribed medication or receiving unnecessary medical treatments that I'll have to pay for.
0.285700	"I always have this general feeling that I will receive bad news when I visit the doctor's office even though I usually don't. I'm a healthy individual. But there's always a sense of ""What don't I know?"" that might pop up. Receiving test results always makes me a bit anxious because of a false positive test that I received one time in my life."
0.785700	I am just an anxious person anyway, so anytime I have to go see my doctor I usually feel this way. I feel like when the doctor walks in he is going to give me the worst news ever, but it is not like that at my usual doctors appointments.
0.690500	If I'm sick, I'm not sure what the diagnosis is, that makes me very anxious for obvious reasons. I'm most nervous when getting tested for STDs/HIV because I'm part of an at risk population, but I do my best to minimize that risk. I don't really get uneasy or uncomfortable talking personal bodily or hygienic stuff because to me that's expected in a medical setting.
0.381000	The possibility of receiving bad news is one thing, but honestly it doesn't make me too worried.  If I receive news about a condition, I am then empowered to do something about it.  The only other thing I can think of that makes me anxious is thinking about the bill I'm going to receive later.
0.833300	Mainly that being sick sucks and there are any number of things that could go wrong. It's no fault of the doctor's and is inherent to my own temperament. 
0.928600	I generally am uncomfortable around doctors and downright panicky around dentists.  I think this is all due to bad experiences as a child that I just cannot seem to get over.
0.619000	There is always a chance that something bad can come up. Being in the office knowing that you may find out awful information is stressful. Likewise, if you haven't been listening to the doctors recommendation, you bound to get yelled at  for that.
0.642900	My health isn't stellar, and I often worry that there's going to be a new condition pop up that I haven't had to contend with before. 
0.404800	Last years diagnoses of cancer and then surgery and then a good diagnoses that they had caught it early.  That does make my appointments more stressful than before.  I think even before that that you wonder or worry more about your health as you get older.
0.142900	I have felt anxious or worried only once when seeing my doctor, and that weas when I had a naccident which fractured my hip.  I had never before experienced a broken bone and was fearful about how painful or long the treatment for recovery would be.
0.619000	When I don't know what is wrong with me and the doctor can't seem to find out either. It make me anxious and uncomfortable, but I try to remain calm so I can get accurate tests done.
0.833300	Whenever I get a physical exam of course I get anxious because anyone can have hidden problems within their body and you never know what may be found at each exam. So as much as I want to stay ahead of the game I dread it every time.
0.238100	Nothing really. I just go there and they take care of things. It takes a bit of extra time out of my day but it's only a hour. 
0.476200	I worry that I might have a serious illness.  I don't have much money, so I can't really afford to be sick.
0.738100	The amount of pain expected from some medical procedures is a cause of worry. Also, being told that there could be an abnormality in some test results. The cost of the visit or tests needed is also bothersome.
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried.  I have not had any serious health issues to date.  I sometimes get a little anxious waiting for blood test results.
0.357100	"I feel like there is a chance that something could be wrong with me and I need to brace myself for some sort of bad news. This can make me feel a little bit anxious when I see a new doctor. Sometimes I also worry that the doctor won't take me seriously because I look ""rough"". I have been pegged as ""drug seeking"" simply because of how I look. This has happened even though I am not even wanting any type of medication and I am a drug and alcohol counselor per profession."
0.571400	I think its probably fear of the unknown... or if I know or think I know what's going on, its a fear of dealing with the issue and what comes with it.
0.285700	Visiting the doctors office rarely makes me feel anxious. If at some point I do feel anxious it might be because the doctor will tell me that I will have to undergo treatment that is not the most convienient for me at the time or I am unfortunately diagnosed with a condition that is not curable. 
0.595200	That I will not be believed when I say I am in pain outside of the normal, that they will decide things about my health based on my appearance rather than my symptoms or not do the right testing because they think they know what my problem is without checking
0.500000	I feel anxious at a doctor's visit whenever I think there might be a possibility of something being seriously wrong (like the time I found a breast mass) or if I feel like the visit and/or tests might be very expensive.
0.381000	I worry sometimes that I will explain something badly pertaining to my medical condition or forget something important even if I write it down or even say too much thereby causing my doctor to send me in for tests or more prescriptions.
0.714300	Most of the time I feel dread and anxious because I'm scared of what they will find out and the cost of the visits and treatments. I'm also scared of their opinions of me in regards to taking care of myself the proper way.
0.142900	Anticipation of receiving possible negative news.  No one wants to hear anything negative at the doctor's office.
0.404800	I think what makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what the physician is going to say to me and if they physician wants to prescribe medications or have me undergo any tests, such as blood tests or sonograms.
0.381000	I don't ever feel overly anxious. I usually go when I need to have an ailment treated with medication. Diagnosis is normally simple and routine. 
0.714300	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is the same thing I just stated in the prior narrative, is that I am concerned that physicians are primarily in the drug business and always looking to push drugs. I know that pharmaceutical companies incentivize physicians to prescribe drugs for pretty much everything and so I always fear that there is a âwitch huntâ in progress as a physician to look for reasons to prescribe and considers which drugs to use.
0.571400	I am worried first and foremost about the cost of procedures.  Next, I'm afraid of being misgendered and then misracialized.
0.904800	Nothing that the doctor did or said, but mostly what I might have wrong with me. I am naturally anxious in these types of situations because I always fear the worst, and getting any sort of negative medical news can be devastating for me. 
0.190500	Mentally I am relaxed, but even benign medical procedures like taking my blood pressure can produce stress responses in me.  It's also difficult when they take blood, my veins are uncooperative and so it's typically a difficult process
0.142900	"It makes me nervous to think about expressing some kind of embarrassing or personal symptoms that might not seem ""normal"". "
0.404800	Social anxiety is one of those things that you have to keep facing, over and over, no matter how scary it is. If you let it take over, it'll get too hard to even leave your house. I was terrified to get help, too. It took weeks before I finally gathered up the courage to make the call. I arrived for my appointment early so I could have time to sit in the car and compose myself before I went in. Once I was in the doctor's office, I shook so much that I could barely grip a pen. My voice came out in rapid little bursts, and I was drenched in sweat.
0.238100	I really don't like being touched by strangers. Even though I have been to my primary care doctor it still feels like being touched by a stranger.
0.285700	When I go to see my doctor I have a certain mindset. I do not let my emotions interfere with my mind, because as we know it can be deter mental to your health. So when I go to see my physician I usually listen to some calm music, trying to calm my nerves if anything, because as any human being we all have emotions, but we can control them, that's matter of practice. So in nutshell when I see my doctor I do not feel anxious or worried about anything and give myself the best chance possible to win. My mind is always on point, I am awake and aware.
0.142900	I typically am not worried when I go to see the doctor as I am ready to face any medical condition I might have. I don't particularly look forward to prostate exams during my annual physical I guess.
0.285700	If the doctor hesitate to tell me about my health reports after examination i would feel most anxious and worried.
0.190500	I sometimes feel like the diagnosis does not match my symptoms. But I know it is all in my head. It is a character flaw nothing to do with my doctor. 
0.714300	I get very nervous about hearing bad news. That I am dying, or that my blood pressure is too high. I have always been afraid of doctors.
0.428600	I am always worried about bad news or if something is seriously wrong with me. It's always anxious when you find out something is wrong with you or if you need to change something in your diet.
0.142900	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something fatally wrong with me. Though I do not believe it is very likely any time soon, I worry about such a diagnosis happening one day. As someone who has a history with cigarettes and medications, I would not be surprised if I experienced a bad prognosis at some point in time. 
0.690500	What would make me feel most anxious is taking test, removing my clothing, getting shots or being told that I have a disease. Most doctors office visits are stressful for me because I have chronic anxiety, however, sometimes I am able to calm myself down during the office visit. I do worry about germs of other people as well, and worry later if I could get sick from them. I usually rush home and shower. 
0.285700	The only time I fell anxious or worried when going to the doctor is when I think that I might have something wrong with me.
0.833300	I am always worried that a doctor is not going to hear what I am telling them or ignore my symptoms and play them down.  Then I get a huge bill a few weeks later.  I often felt like I was scammed or taken advantage of. This has happened so many times in the past.  
0.428600	I am getting older and just never know what my body is doing.i feel like my so called body clock is getting closer to its expiration date so to speak.i want to live a long life.
0.738100	I am pretty anxious in general, but working in healthcare, I feel I know a lot of the bad things that can happen. It's hard for me to get some of those things out of my head.
0.595200	I worry that the doctor will find something going on in me that I will not be able to afford the treatment for, or that the treatment will have serious side effects. I worry that the doctor might see something embarrassing or shame me for being overweight.
0.619000	I worry that something is going to be wrong with me that I can not fix.  I don't like waiting in the waiting room or in the exam room.  I usually can't wait to get out of there.  
0.428600	I don't really feel anxious about visiting the doctor, I feel like I am wasting my time. I'm not worried either.
0.261900	Its the anticipation. I know I could feel find but they chance that they find something or my blood work shows elevated LFTS or other medical issues such as anemia sometimes worries me.
0.238100	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just not knowing.  Not knowing on a few visits if I was going to have to do a basic test as the hospital and all the trouble that entails.  That's all. 
0.333300	depends on why I'm there, last time was for my back sciatica and I was expecting a worse case thing because the pain was severe, but it turned out not to be a major issue and in a few months I was good again
0.428600	I am always worried that something far worse than I have will occur. I tend to think overly regarding what could possibly be wrong. It is usually something pretty common however.
0.404800	Because I have a physician's assistant who is in our family I can usually get a good take on what is wrong with me. However, when something major happens such as the prostate cancer I went through and still must be checked on a periodic basis ... I admit I feel a little anxious and worried before the visit is over. Once I get the all clear signal I am back to normal. I usually do not sweat over it until the day of the visit.
0.547600	I am not sure. I guess it would be if it is just a check up or for a specific reason. If it is for a specific reason then I am always worried about what they may find or tell me.
0.523800	I don't feel a lot of these emotions. I usually am a pretty calm, cool, and collected person that tends not to make mountains out of mole hills. Due to the good fortune of never having a whole lot of serious health problems, my anxiety around doctors is pretty low, i'm not scared of needles, i believe in science and most of western medicine. I do experience some anxiety when waiting for test results, especially for serious things HIV, Hepatitis, Ect. I feel annoyance sometimes at having to wait so long in the waiting rooms, and do get a bit nervous about actually contracting diseases or sicknesses from waiting rooms and hospital lobbies. 
0.142900	I don't feel worried about the doctor because I feel the worst is over now ill get some medicine to feel better
0.476200	Its just embarassing. I am a modest person, so having ANYONE see me naked or half dressed is stressful
0.428600	SOMETIMES I WORRY THAT I'VE WAITED TOO LONG TO GO SEE THE DOCTOR ABOUT AN ISSUE AND THUS I CREATED AN INSTANCE WHERE MY TREATMENT WILL LAST LONGER THAN IT NEEDED TO OR THAT MY TREATMENT WILL COST MORE THAN IT WOULD HAVE HAD I GONE TO THE DOCTOR EARLIER.
0.642900	I am always anxious or worried about receiving bad news. I never want to end up leaving their offices knowing that I could have done something differently, but now that I did not, I will suffer in some way.
0.690500	I am considered about my taste of health and an uneasy as to what new concerns might popup when visiting the doctor's office. I get worried about what the test results might show and am somewhat apprehensive about get the results back.
0.857100	I have panic attacks,which I control with medication.  But, when I go to the doctor, I get very scared about them taking my blood pressure.  One time it was very high and they were concerned, but it was because I was having a panic attack in the office.  Now I always worry that my blood pressure will be high, and consquently my blood pressure is high!
0.142900	I usually don't feel nervous or worried when I go to the doctor's office.  The things that make me a little nervous are waiting in the waiting room and wondering which medications I might need if I'm sick.
0.642900	Not knowing what the outcome of what i am there for. Telling me things that i am probably not going to want to hear. Being told i am doing something wrong. I feel anxious not knowing the results of tests i have had taken. Prescribing pills that have side effects is nerve wracking.
0.500000	I meant to put anxious and nervous sometimes around doctors because it depends on why I am going to the doctors for. If it is something serious then I would feel nervous and anxious. 
0.333300	I feel anxious mainly because I have general anxiety with my life. But it is the idea of not yet knowing what is wrong with me. And I generally think about the worst case scenario.
0.142900	For some reason I get anxious. But once I am in there I don't feel scared at all because my doctor makes me feel  better. Perhaps it's just the environment and anticipation that makes me scared.
0.785700	The uncertainty over the possibilities of what health issues could arise or be identified, not knowing what outcomes are possible and may occur.
0.500000	The uncertainty of not knowing whatâs making me feel ill, of having something very hurtful or that may result in a painful procedure or that might cost a lot of money.
0.714300	Well I am an anxious person to begin with so just having to go to the doctor is already enough to make me anxious. Plus it makes me feel vulnerable and uncomfortable sitting there being examined, often times in that flimsy robe thing. On top of that there is the overall worry of what might be wrong with you.
0.523800	I'm generally calm in the doctor's office, but if I'm going in with something unknown, where I'm not certain what it is, there is a general anxiousness about the severity or seriousness of what I may be told. That I'm thinking it's something minor but it's something major. I have a bit more anxiousness than others, since I've had the experience where I received unexpected news that I had a serious disease before.
0.547600	I am worried about the diagnosis I may receive and whether or not I will be able to afford the treatment or medications I need. My main concern is the cost of treatment.
0.547600	Not knowing what my condition is like and the chances of getting some news that might make me worry. Also I worry about the length of time it might take, because often I've waited ridiculous amounts of time. 
0.976200	I have not taken good proactive care of my health- and I would be extremely anxious that I have some condition like cancer or heart disease. I feel like I would be mostly alone and struggle badly to fight any condition or disease well with the mindset and resources I have at this time.
0.928600	I feel most worried about my doctor judging me due to my health or possible mental problems I am experiencing. I do not feel I am able to be completely honest. 
0.142900	Like many other patients, I am more anxious when running my regular checkups and expecting the results from the lab. I would also be quite nervous if there would be a complication and he would need to send me to the hospital.
0.500000	Generally speaking, I am fine going to the doctor's office unless I am waiting on test results for something or expected to have blood drawn, which I hate. I was the most anxious/worried when I was pregnant, as I had a number of manageable issues arise. Each time I went for another appointment, I feared the news of something else.
0.738100	I get just anxious about seeing and being around people. I don't know what it is. Afraid of things that could happen but I know they won't. 
0.357100	I'm not quite sure what it is, but every time I go to a doctors appointment I always feel a little trepidation. Its not that I'm worried they will find something wrong with me, but there is just always this sense of anticipation. It is completely illogical, and I know it. Maybe its perhaps that even though doctors are associated with caring for one's health, they are also associated with sickness and disease. 
0.619000	mainly just being at the office knowing that i may have to get blood drawn or something, or if i have to get a pap test that makes me very anxious b/c it is painful
0.142900	Usually it's just stepping on the scale and seeing that it has crept on up again.  That and wondering if my blood pressure will be up or down.  I have no problems with any physical exam she may give, but of course may be anxious to find out what is causing the symptoms - whether it's serious for my health or just a minor problem.
0.976200	I get anxious when I worry about whether the doctor will assist me in a way that I personally agree with or if they will demand I do things that are out of my comfort zone, such as taking medications I do not wish to take or taking tests that I find to be dangerous.
0.500000	Right now I'm uneasy because the treatment that has worked for me in the past is being denied to me, and the new treatment has caused a 50 lb weight gain (I was a perfectly healthy, trim weight before!). And when that comes up, doctors don't like to acknowledge the treatments I am on are the main culprit of the weight gain. They just blame me, which is dumb since I have ALWAYS been trim, and was looking good at 45 before all these stupid treatments. 
0.500000	In general I always get tense visits to the doctors because I always think the worst of my diagnoses and it makes me nervous to think about the results, it is a tense situation and I think it is something that all patients experience
0.547600	The doctor might be concerned about what symptoms I've been having. I never know when my health might change. 
0.523800	Usually I go to the doctorâs office for a reason â recently I had a skin cancer diagnosis â so Iâm obviously concerned about the results of a visit. Also, Iâm kind of getting tired of the hassle of healthcare. I have a growth that needs looked at â I know thatâs going to be at least four visits. The initial visit, another visit to get the growth removed, another visit to have a follow-up (either stitches removed or just a wound check for healing), and another check in a couple of months to make sure nothing is growing back. Iâm not anxious about regular check-ups very much.
0.261900	I wonder how the tests will come out. I wonder if my blood pressure is high, although its been normal for some time now. There is uncertainty. 
0.619000	A male OB/GYN threatened to impregnate me during an examination. He said he was joking, but I didn't go back to an OB/GYN for years after that because I would start to feel anxious while trying to make an appointment
0.166700	I don't really get anxious or worried at the doctor most of the time. Sometimes if I have a problem that could be potentially serious I'll feel uncomfortable, but that has only happened once or twice. I also don't really like undressing at the doctor, but I opt not to and my doctor is fine with it.
0.285700	I do not like to wait for test results to say what is going on with my overall health I like to know right away what is happening and going on .
0.309500	Sometimes when I go to the doctors office and it is something more serious my mind often goes to the worst case scenario and how my life would be impacted if something is really wrong with my health. I worry that it might be some difficult procedure needed to make me well again.  
0.857100	Just what they may find. Something that I wasn't expecting. Me needing a treatment I can't afford. Just the whole experience really. 
0.309500	I usually don't get anxious.  They only times that I really am worried or anxious is if I know I am going to a dr. that doesnt listen to me or I think won't.  Or if it is for one of my children and I know something is wrong with them.
0.523800	Just knowing that I may end up with a doctor who does not really want to take the time to listen to my complaints and will just try to push some drug on me makes me anxious.  I am not relaxed going in just thinking about that.
0.785700	I am worried that there will be something wrong with me.  I am worried that I will walk out sick or on several medications.  
0.190500	With me getting up in age I get more worried then I did when I was younger. Any kind of symptoms that I'm having now I sometimes think the worst and that I'm seriously ill.  
0.523800	I get apprehensive about what they may tell me about my test results, and how I will react if the news is bad.
0.833300	because I have so many different problems with my health I don't know what is going to be next because it seems like every time I go to the doctor something else is wrong
0.476200	I think I feel apprehensive whenever I have to reschedule an appointment or have to wait far longer than anticipated prior to seeing the doctor or when having to wait while s/he checks on a particular result.
0.523800	what makes me more anxious or worry is knowing if i'm good or if i'm gonna need take pills, have an illness that is hard to cure.
0.547600	I feel a little anxious about doctor visits in general. The clinical setting makes me feel a little uncomfortable and it usually ends up being a source of work for myself later in order to continue my healthcare. 
0.738100	In most cases the cause of anxiety is usually the uncertainity sorounding a test whose outcome is unknown. We do not have control over outcomes of tests and however compassionate the physician is, I always get worried. I believe it's normal though.
0.523800	I feel anxious and worried that perhaps someone will make a mistake that very well could have been avoided.
0.428600	Knowing that you will likely find out what is wrong with you and hoping that it's not something expensive or bad. Also, hoping you get worthwhile information out of going in relation to the cost of going. Or the possibility of having to feel pain from procedures.
0.952400	Even though it hasn't been diagnosed, I'm certain that I've got some form of an anxiety disorder, so I'm pretty much always on edge when visiting the doctor's office. I'm a pretty modest person (and being asexual probably doesn't help this), so anything that involves getting a little too touchy-feely makes me extremely uncomfortable. For instance, I know that I should really visit a gynecologist or the like, but the thought of it freaks me out too much. I actually took far longer than I should have to go to the doctor about my IBS before I knew what it was, because I was afraid that I'd have to have a colonoscopy or something similar (as mentioned earlier, I was fortunate that my doctor also suffers from it, so as soon as I started talking about my symptoms, she knew exactly what it was).
0.857100	I am always anxious and worried so it would be no different in the doctor's office. I guess I would be concerned that I would find out that I had some incurable disease or something at the doctor's office.
0.333300	As dumb as it sounds, what worries me the most is what the doctor's will find.  Kind of the concept that ignorance is bliss, if I don't go then I don't have to worry about whatever is going on in my body.  I also don't like having fasting blood draws, so if I can avoid those I generally feel a lot better.  In addition, if it's not a standard wellness visit, generally you already know there's something wrong and I worry it might be more serious than it is.
0.285700	I don't generally feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office. I am satisfied with the service and am treated well by everyone there. I don't feel negative about the experience.
0.404800	When I visit my Doctor I'm worried that he will find something seriously wrong with me. He is upfront about my health issues and wouldn't hold back if he found some thing wrong with me. 
0.357100	I rarely feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office. My health is reasonable and most issues are fairly common at this point. 
0.761900	Getting a new diagnoses or starting new treatment always sucks.  Waiting for them to come in with lab results is always a worrisome time too, not knowing if things are going the way we scare hoping and the anticipation is scary,
0.285700	Aside from the tedious visits which is a constant reminder that I am a cancer patient, I have no qualms other than that I do not work and my income is low which makes daily living sometimes unbearable.  I was a vibrant 62 year old with my own home a gorgeous leased vehicle and then in an instant I was a cancer patient.  It was not how I envisioned my life to be and was hopeful that I would work until full retirement age of 66 or later.  Visiting the cancer center is not a big deal.
0.261900	Iâm generally not worried about going to the doctorâs office. I would only become worried if a doctor gave me a reason to be after an examination. I donât necessarily go into the appointment worried 
0.142900	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting doctor's office. I believe and trust in god. I am going to tell my issues and the doctor might help me based on her knowledge.
0.881000	I can't really explain what makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. I am nervous when I go there no matter what. It doesn't matter if I have a current health issue or not. Getting my blood taken amps up my anxiousness though because I am afraid of needles. I always feel like I'm going to get bad news at the doctor. I think a lot of it has to do with my father and how he ended up dying. He had cardiovascular disease and me and all of my siblings also have some form of it. I lost 3 siblings this past year from heart related issues with no warning signs. 
0.285700	I always have a fear in the back of my mind of finding something wrong about my health. Both sides of my parents have a history of diabetes, and my mother's side have a history of cancer so anytime I go for a check up I worry about finding out that I may have it.
0.214300	Though not prone to hypochondria, there is something about waiting for information about your health when you are at the doctor's office for other than a routine checkup...
0.523800	I worry because when I go to the doctor it is usually because i have been having some symptoms and the doctor is going to tell me what is wrong, and I dont want anything to be wrong
0.881000	"I am worried about something very bad being wrong with me, and the potential that it will hurt me, my family, or cost lots of money and time.  If something very bad is wrong, all of those things I just mentioned will cause even more anxiety, every day without going away for a long time.  I am worried about how this will be perceived by my doctors. I am not this sort of people on a daily basis when I am ""fine"", I am most anxious in the doctors office because when I am there, it is because something is already potentially wrong.  Doctors generally try to prescribe anxiety or anti-depressants which I continually turn down for various reasons.  So then I an anxious about how they perceive me, and about how that they are wrong about what they are thinking about me overall."
0.523800	Well, if I'm going to the doctor's office (other than for a routine checkup) it's because I think something is wrong. If I think something is wrong, I'm worried about what that might be! Although usually they don't find anything to start with, then it's rounds of tests and exams and more uncertainty, which is stressful.
0.381000	My biggest fear is that I have something terminal and that when they examine me they will discover something terrible.  I am very anxious to get the results of tests and screenings.
0.714300	I don't like when there is something wrong with me and I don't know what it is. My fears get the best of me and I worry a lot.
0.642900	I worry that something will be wrong with me. I also have been gaining weight and get nervous when I have to get on a scale anymore. I don't want to be unhealthy.
0.595200	Thinking about whether I can explain my condition exactly or not is one thing that makes me anxious. Expressing condition is difficult. Also, when getting result of test, I will be anxious because there is no grantee if the result is good one. Especially after having PAP test and mammography, I become so anxious to hear the result.
0.857100	That they are always going to tell me worst case. I also fear that I will be looked down upon because I don't really understand what they are telling me. I have anxiety just thinking about my next appointment.
0.714300	When visiting the doctors off I feel scared more than anything due to the concern that anything can happen. I always feel nervous when entering the doctors office due to just the unknown of what could happen upon entering.
0.404800	will not get the information I need because we all know they spend very little time with each client
0.523800	I don't know exactly why I just get a little nervous when I go to the doctor or the dentist.  I am nervous and then I am relieved when I find out I am okay.  even if there's an issue, I am still relieved.  I think that just not knowing, and uncertainty about one's health is nerve-wracking.
0.309500	If I have all of my children with me Iâm only anxious that they will behave.  Iâm sometimes anxious that if I donât agree with what the doctor says I wonât feel bold enough to question it to their face.  I feel anxious when thereâs a disconnect between what they believe about a topic and what I believe.  I donât want to appear like I know more than the doctor, like I question their authority.  I feel anxious about not being in agreement with the doctor because I want to do what is right.  I donât like feeling like I have to go research on my own to make that determination.  
0.500000	I'm usually nervous that they will find something severely wrong with me, like cancer. So I avoid going to the doctor as often as I can. I also tend to get jumbled thoughts and get extremely nervous and it's hard for me to articulate to them what I have going on or what I may need. It also doesn't help that when I do speak up, I get shot down and they just assume it's something that I don't need to be concerned about.
0.642900	I have generalized anxiety disorder and usually am always full of anxiety even if there is nothing wrong. What makes me the most anxious is the uncertainty of each visit. I Always expect the worst in every visit thinking something is seriously wrong with me. I cannot control this fear.  
0.547600	I mostly worry about the germs I'm getting sitting in the waiting room. I also do not enjoy the shots that come along with physicals. They tend to give me anxiety but I do not necessarily have a problem with the doctor, nurse, or the wait time when I do have an appointment. 
0.714300	the feeling that given my age i might be diagnosed with a serious, life-threatening or costly condition. Or even worse, I condition for which I am referred to a specialist and they disagree in prognosis with the primary physician. 
0.642900	That they are going to find something alarming or that they are going to give me some piece of advice that will be difficult or unpleasant to take.
0.309500	I sometimes worry that something will be found that will come as a shock or a scary diagnosis.  I also worry some kind of testing will need to be done
0.642900	When a doctor tells me that they are concerned about something and we need to run tests. Then when those tests take forever to come back with the results. That is the worst feeling.
0.190500	i was quiet tensed if my health condition is not good. Even though it is small issue and it is not healing for many days that time i felt very disappointed. So at this type of issues i worried a lot. And each time i visit doctors office i was feeling like at least this time the problem should resolved. And also i was anxious about injections.
0.619000	That i will get a bad diagnosis. That i may need to have an uncomfortable procedure performed. Or maybe the amount of money needed wont be enough 
0.381000	I worry maybe my blood work might come back with something wrong. Otherxious.than that I usually am not anxious.
0.666700	If somethings bothering me, my biggest concern is that the doctor won't really give it too much attention and that they'll just brush it off and maybe give me a prescription that won't really help that much. I worry that i'll have to live with something that's bothering me just based off the fact that a doctor wants to get on with his  day without putting much thought into my problems. 
0.714300	Using my recent visit, I worry about the cost of the visit itself, the work they want done, and anything else (kind of like a lawyer's fees for responding to emails, or making phone calls) that needs to be done. That is number one. Number two, is just being told there might be things wrong with you when you feel like you are pretty good. It creates a psychological tendency to worry about the issue, potentiating the extremity of the issue.
0.857100	That he or she will find something wrong with me that I did not know about. Also, that they would tell me what I am doing to stay healthy is not good enough or not working.
0.523800	I feel as if my doctor is going to tell me either something is terribly wrong with me or that i need some sort of risky procedure
1.000000	Like I said, I think I'm a kind of hypochondriac. It's very easy to convince myself I have any disease I hear of, and so I just want to avoid the whole situation, like going to the doctor will make it worse. Also, I've had really bad experiences with doctors mistreating my family members.
1.000000	I absolutely detest anyone touching me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach and sends my mind reeling even just sitting here thinking about it. I don't want any doctor disregarding or disrespecting my body autonomy. I would 100% avoid any circumstance where a doctor could even touch my arm.
0.404800	The only thing I get anxious about is when I have to get a flu shot or my blood drawn. I have needles and they freak me out otherwise I am fine.
0.785700	I tend to overthink every little situation. It's not the visit to the doctor's office that worries me or makes me anxious. It's the diagnosis that scares me. Whenever I catch something or develop a cold, my mind always seems to convince me that it's something serious. So, of course, my trips to the doctor have me feeling very anxious until I get a proper diagnosis and realize it's not that bad.
0.142900	I sometimes dread getting bad test results or trying a new mediciation/treatment that might give me bad side effects. I also don't enjoy needles so that gives me anxiety. 
0.500000	The thing I find most worrisome is a doctor not being able to recognize the symptoms of what I may be going through
0.857100	I am fearful of any health conditions I might be diagnosed with, nervous about the vitals, taking of blood, and of the office in general.
0.476200	Not knowing what will come out his mouth about thre test he just ran on me.  You always go in thinking hey I do this right, but still not knowing what came from these test blood work.  That has me a little worried
0.714300	What worries me most when going to the doctor's office is not knowing what it is that they will be doing and what they will find.  I also find it somewhat unsettling to have a stranger looking me over and touching me. 
0.500000	I don't like needles. I don't mind going to the doctor that much, but I know that if they are going to be drawing blood that it's going to make me uneasy. I also feel anxious about my own body weight and self conscious about it.
0.500000	I'm a person who has anxiety to begin with, so the uncertainty of what they might find makes me even more anxious.  It's also time spent away from the family, and that is something that makes me anxious as well.
0.690500	It is not comfortable being poked and prodded, so I always get anxious about that. And then I start thinking what if something shows up? There is a level they watch in my blood work and I worry it has fallen and I will have to go to a specialist. 
0.714300	I am worried when checking up on chronic conditions, wanting to make sure that I am not about to hear bad news about my health. I think a doctor's office inherently makes people nervous. 
0.904800	I am nervous that they are going to find a major issue with my health. I am also nervous that they will miss something major with my health. 
0.309500	Waiting for a result. There are times when you may not get a result back for a week or two, and you have to wait to see what is going to happen next. In that waiting time, you have to pick your head up and continue on, as hard as it may be. 
0.738100	I just always feel like there might be something wrong that they are going to discover and that puts me on edge. 
0.761900	Well personally I don't like to be touched and I don't like to be spoken to in a demeaning way. I'm very bright, I'm in a Ph.D. program for pete's sake so it makes me worried that physicians think I'm stupid but aren't even nice about it and don't try to explain in  a way that would make sense to me or don't even take the time. Also the being touched thing is obviously a huge source of anxiety as well which stems more from my personal history. Like I'm 22 and I still haven't had a pap smear because I just can't do it. And I had an older male doctor as a kid who didn't explain what he was doing and was examining me and it was just a weird and difficult experience and it's hard to advocate for yourself with a doctor when they always think they know best. Sorry this answer is so long I hope it kind of made sense! Also bruh I don't understand health insurance for the life of me so that makes me worried too. I hate spending money so having to pay $25 for a copay when I feel like the doctor didn't even do anything makes me cranky and anxious about my budgeting. 
0.357100	When I visit the doctor, my biggest worry is how much it will cost. I don't have very much money and my insurance is very bad. Even a little test can end up being thousands of dollars and I don't have the ability to pay it. 
0.285700	I really do not feel anxious or worried when I visit a doctor, other than the off chance that there might be a serious illness and not just a routine sickness going on. Although I tend to be optimistic that most things I would experience are very treatable. 
0.761900	I worry that I will be referred to yet another doctor who will then refer me to another doctor. I am also worried that I will be told that the only thing they can do is give me another pill to take. 
0.547600	The doctor makes me wait in the back room for hours. The room is often too warm and my health issues do not do well in extreme temperatures.
0.261900	i am sometimes feeling so because i don not know what he is going to say this time. one thing about doctors is that they must see what is wrong with your body. so going to them can make think ahead what to hear from them
0.142900	I guess just knowing that I didn't hit the weight goal that I had for myself. I gained weight while I was pregnant and haven't completely lost all of that weight.
0.333300	Its entirelt possible that my health is such that the my doctor might find a problem that will be of major concern to me. Luckily I have never left the doctors office with such worries as my doctor has always been upfront with me about my health.
0.547600	I think the possibility of them finding something like a tumor or cancer.  Also I feel like they judge me for not being healthier or in better shape
0.857100	When visiting a doctor's office, I'm mainly afraid of 1) how uncomfortable the examination or procedure may be, and 2) any possible bad news I may receive as a result/following the examination.  Usually everything else (work, payment for services, etc.) is secondary.
0.500000	Im always worried im going to have something major wrong with me or they will find something very wrong with me.  I also scared i may have an infection of some sort.
0.761900	I might get information I don't like about a medical condition. I might have to have an awkward conversation with the doctor. The doctor may have to examine me, and an unfamiliar person doing that is not the most comfortable situation. 
0.142900	There really was nothing that made me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. If anything, the only unpleasant part about visiting the doctor's office is the wait.
0.381000	I have had a lump removed from my breast and I have to have it checked to make sure it has not returned or any others have formed. I get anxious when I know it is time to have my check up.
0.142900	I don't think I ever feel anxious or worried. I think if I did, the only reason would be if my blood work panels came back normal. My doctor always treats me with respect and I never feel apprehensive or anxious to go to the doctor. 
0.428600	I have a chronic pain disorder, so when I see a new doctor I'm always anxious that they won't believe that my pain is real. 
0.309500	Finding out something is terribly wrong with me would be very bad news. I'm very relieved every time this is not the case. It's best to check things early and practice preventative care instead of be late to treat something after it develops.
0.523800	I was anxious and worried that they were going to tell me that I was going to need surgery for my tonsils a few years ago because I had constant sore throats.  My PCP was able to make a great decision with me about not having surgery because it would not have helped in the situation.
0.857100	The biggest thing that I fear is finding out that I am going to have a serious medical issue.  The longer I have to wait the worse it is.
0.619000	I worry that my doctor is going to give me potentially life threatening news. I'm left in the dark for most of my usually long visit and it just adds to my anxiety.

0.357100	I feel most anxious, or worried, about the fact that this is the place where I could potentially learn of something negative about my health, something life threatening, debilitating, etc. I know this is the place, and the doctor is the person, that this news will come from.
0.714300	Well if I am in a doctorâs office that generally means that I am hurt or sick and I cannot take care of it on my own. So I am worried that the illness or injury is going to be worse that I feared. 
0.285700	How invasive things can be. That's what prevents me from going most of the time. I'd like to be able to discuss things with a doctor remotely (say, online) and then if a more invasive visit is needed we could arrange for a face-to-face. 
0.619000	I always feel anxious at the doctor office, because I never know what they are going to find.  Even if I am healthy, I worry they may find something bad.

0.690500	Getting a bad report.  I don't want to hear that I am not as healthy as I hoped to be. I feel there is more I could do to be healthier.

0.238100	Worried that the doctor will miss something or discover something I was unaware of.  Anxiety comes from being in the doctors office for a sickness that I want cured and having to rely on someone else to make the right choice as to what best cures that sickness. Sometimes I also get a little uneasy challenging the doctor.  For example, if I think one medication is better suited to my sickness, but the doctor is recommending something else. 
0.690500	Remember that doctors are there to help you and try to solve your health problems. It's not their purpose to hurt you as much as possible. On the contrary, they will try to achieve what needs to be done with as little pain as possible. Yet some things just hurt. No doctor can change that, unfortunately. Try to pluck up courage s much ad possible and say to yourself: we're just gonna do it. I'm not gonna get beaten by a stupid needle!!! Try it, next time. It works and you will feel proud of yourself!
0.904800	Because you never know if they may tell you that it's something wrong with you. This is the reason why many people don't go to the dr's office as much as they should. We hate and fear hearing bad news.  Even just the thought of it makes a person feel at ease almost instantly.
0.809500	I am usually anxious about the visit especially when there is an examination, I get worried about the procedure and the results. 
0.333300	I feel what makes me  feel anxious is the unknown. Not knowing what the Dr. may  say or if they would take your issue seriously and try to find the best resolution possible for the issues you are having.
0.738100	I worry that I'll learn that something is seriously wrong with me, or that my doctor will miss something important when examining me.
0.690500	Being 67 years old, I know that age brings about potential health issues.  Also being fairly healthy my whole life, the law of averages may rear its ugly head.  I know I do not always eat right and not exercise enough and I know the doctor will ask, I will be honest and he will prod me to do better.
0.666700	Sometimes i get worried when visiting a doctor due to the fear of expressing myself and also anxious of knowing my health status. 
0.881000	I get judged a lot.  My chronic condition involved weight gain.  I often feel the doctors see only the weight gain and not the person

0.381000	I'm anxious about there might be something wrong with my body. It's not about my doctors, at most time, they performed a great job
0.500000	I'm worried that are going to find something horribly wrong about my health.  I am scared to receive bad news.  I'm also concerned that the doctor will recommend treatments I am uncomfortable with.  Also I am concerned the doctor will be irritated if I question such treatments.  
0.285700	Only if I am unable to see my regular doctor and the doctor I see seems preoccupied with other things and other patients. I want someone who is focused on me and my issues. 
0.166700	My greatest concern when visiting the doctor's office is that I will be rushed and/or the doctor will not take my concerns seriously. I have a hearing loss and difficulty understanding individuals with strong accents. Therefore, this is also causes anxiety if I am meeting this doctor for the first time. 
0.666700	"I see a doctor for one of two things: an unusual symptom or condition, or an annual checkup. During the former, I sometimes wonder if my symptoms could indicate a more serious medical problem, or worry how long the condition might persist, even with treatment. In the latter, a ""wellness check"", I worry that I may have an unrecognized problem that will affect my overall health, or require extensive and/or expensive treatment. Since I am typically in very good physical condition, the thought of being ill bothers me a lot."
0.357100	Mostly that I'll forget to ask all of the questions that I have in mind or that I won't understand what the doctor is telling me and that I'll be too afraid to ask for a better explanation.
0.595200	I have a slight fear about needles and not a lot of tolerance with pain. I always have a feeling that if I have to go see a doctor I will need to have needles stuck in me and that makes me nervous. Also, doctors' offices and environments are often unpleasant and do not help one feel more at ease.
0.309500	The longer I wait, the more anxious I become. As I become more stressed and anxiety builds, the waiting time seems longer and the time seems to pass slower causing me tto become even more stressed.
0.595200	Don't like taking my clothes off. Don't like waiting for doctor. Don't like being weighed. Don't like being told to lose weight.
0.690500	I have ha enough health issues in my life to get a sense of deja vu or flashbacks - I always have a feeling that something is about to pop up. And since I'm generally healthy, when I am at the doctor, it's usually for a pretty good reason.
0.714300	Depending on the reason for the visit, the illness itself is enough to cause such extreme anxiety. Add in the process of divulging highly personal information to people you barely know and you have a recipe for tension.
0.428600	My family has a long history of heart trouble, in particular high blood pressure, so I am always anxious when I go in for a physical that now will be my time to start down the heart disease path.  I also worry about mammograms. I haven't had any diagnoses that justify my concern, but I do nonetheless.
0.619000	I'm always worried that the doctor will find something wrong with me that I didn't know about or that the doctor will criticize some part of how I live or what I should or shouldn't be doing with my life. 
0.619000	A combination of mild social anxiety and worrying that something will turn out to be not right with me, for example, my blood pressure being too high or something like that. I care a lot about my health, so having it examined is a high-stakes thing for me.
0.690500	I'm afraid it will be a complete waste of my time and money, and they will fail to figure out whats wrong with me or help me try to figure out some solutions.  I'll leave the doctors office poorer and no better off healthwise.  I also don't like it and worry about when it takes them a month or two to schedule mroe advance procedures like go see a neurologist to deal with right now problem.  I pay them copay to have them tell me to go see another doctor...
0.285700	I usually don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, since I know I am in good hands.If necessary I know the doctor would refer me to someone who would be as caring  and efficient as her.
0.523800	If I have to get naked or show my crotch that makes me the most nervous.  If I have to get blood drawn that will also make me a bit nervous as I am not a big fan of needles.  My biggest hesitation when seeing a dr. is how much the treatment is going to cost.
0.595200	I am worried that I might find out that I have a serious and expensive disease like cancer.  If I had cancer it would complete change how I live my life.
0.619000	I feel a little anxious when I go to the doctor because I know she is going to tell me that for my health I need to eat better and exercise.  I don't do those things and I know she will get on to me about it.
0.976200	I am worried about the doctor telling me I may have a disease or a condition with no cure.  I dont like people examining me.  I cant afford medical treatment.
0.833300	The fact that I might have something wrong with me but they will not notice it or even care to do a follow up on it. Also I can sense their lack of caring and that troubles me a lot as well.
0.428600	I think it's just the concept that you may be of ill-health and that's a very troubling and worrisome thought for anyone.
0.404800	I usually get bad news so I try to prepare for the worse case scenario but I never know what it is. I worry I'll have a new chronic illness.
0.428600	Not seeing my doctor is not the problem. It is the actual diagnosis of what my illness is that makes me nervous.
0.142900	The only thing that would make me feel anxious or worried is if I had something that I did against the direction of my doctor. I would feel bad and not want to see my doctor.
0.238100	The only thing that makes me anxious is not knowing how much time I will have to wait to see the doctor. I usually have to wait 1-1/2 to 2 hours to see her despite having an appointment. Once, a few years ago, I missed an important meeting at work because I wrongly assumed that my doctor's visit would be over in about an hour; it ended up being 2 hours because I had to wait a long time to see her, and my actual time with her was about 15 minutes. 
0.619000	Honestly for any physical exam it would be getting on the scale. It really sucks because I work really hard on my body and I have been gaining muscle so I know I am going to weigh more, but I don't want to. 
0.381000	In medicine, not everything is 100%, but very close. So naturally, when someone goes to their physician they are there for a particular reason, so I find it natural for one to feel anxious or worried because fear for the unknown. Iâm general, everyone needs to go see a doctor, for not only maintaining a healthy life, but preventing bad from occurring, and these types of feelings occur, along with excitement and pride when all comes out good. 
0.666700	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor is the fact that I might have a medical condition that will cost a lot of money to cure or a long time.
0.166700	The thing I am most worried about is getting sick from other people while at the doctor's office.  I usually take herbal supplements and colloidal silver to overcome this issue.  The other thing I get worried about is the doctor not listening to what I have to say and then brushing me off as it's time to go the next patient.
0.738100	I tend to feel most anxious about what the doctor may discover.  For some reason, it seems that every time I have any kind of medical test, the doctor finds something new that is wrong with me.  It makes me feel that I don't won't the doctor to run any new tests because I know they are going to find something wrong.  Based on all of my recent experiences, I am seriously considering switching to a holistic doctor.
0.309500	There's always the worry that they will randomly find something serious that you did not have. I feel that everyone has this worry.
0.238100	I am worried that they will find something serious that is wrong with me. I dont think its a very rational fear because I am in very good health but it is something that always lingers in the back of my mind while i am waiting in the waiting room at the doctor's office. I usually just want to get in, get treated, and get out as quickly as possible so that I can go back home.
0.476200	I am often worried of the things that I will learn. I feel grim or hopeless at times and my doctor is there for me. They listen, explain and let me ven't without judging in any way. I am often scared to face certain things or news, but in reality, it's life and u can get thru anything.
0.285700	The possibility of having a health complication that will affect my day to day life. It would be very unpleasant to hear that I would have to take medication for the rest of my life for a health condition.
0.333300	I have not been with this doctor for an extended period f time. I need to spend a little more time underneath the care of this particular provider, in order to have complete faith in them.
0.642900	I am most worried about the cost and pain of treatment. I also worry about how much time I might have to take off from work if something is seriously wrong. I have had a few medical treatments that cost thousands of dollars and had me out of work for a few days.
0.523800	I always have a tiny worry somewhere in the back of my mind that whatever small ailment is bothering me is actually a symptom of something huge and very serious, like a tumor or something
0.476200	i hate a new doctors visit and the nurse practitioner i saw was a different one then the on i saw a few years back at the same facility 
0.381000	Most of the time myself and many people visit doctor's offices is because there is something wrong, so being examined for the problem you've been having can make you slightly anxious or worried of the outcome of the examination. While it's great to potentially get answers for medical problems, you can get informed that what you're experiencing is worse than you expected. I believe that is typically in the back of the minds of most people in a doctor's care.
0.738100	I worry about getting blood drawn, about being declared somehow more unhealthy and having to have more work done, especially procedures or accompanying meds that I can't afford.
0.666700	My biggest fear is that I will receive news contrary to what I'm hoping for.  This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.
0.214300	It makes me feel anxious when I'm in an appointment with him and he just goes away and spends a long time outside, leaving me just waiting, just looking the ceiling and worried about what problems I may have, it's really annoying and not a good action of him.
0.619000	By the time I get to the doctor I've often thought of all the most terrible things my symptoms could be and though I know the worry is mostly unfounded, I am still anxious until I'm proven wrong.
0.238100	I absolutely hate that most doctors base your general health on the BMI index, when not everyone's shape is cookie cutter, or fits the categories. I get anxious when doctor's bring up my weight, because rather than argue with them about it, I just let them talk.
0.642900	 The thing that worries me the most is the bill I'll receive. Every passing minute I'm in that office, every procedure or drug prescribed is more money that I probably can't afford to pay even with insurance. I shouldn't have to focus on that but rather be focused on why I'm there in the first place. I seriously doubt I'm in the minority who think this way.
0.333300	If there is something wrong I am worried of the outcome, of any possible conditions or complications. Going to the Doctors sitting there mostly naked is the most comfortable experience.
0.500000	I feel most worried when visiting a new doctor because I have to meet a new person and I don't know what to expect. 
0.476200	there is always the chance of the unknown no matter how healthy you feel or how well you think you are doing following your health Regine.
0.666700	I am usually concerned with having a high blood pressure. My father had White Coat syndrome, and I fear that I have inherited that from him. I do not like the sterile waiting rooms.
0.381000	The idea that a stranger is going to examine me and that he has the ability to diagnose me with illnesses or a clean bill of health.
0.571400	i don't feel anxious or worried at all if i am just having a visit or have only a small problem that is not serious.   if i had a serious problem, then i would be worried and maybe have a second opinion after their diagnosis of me
0.333300	I ususally do not feel anxious. I have a pretty go with the flow personality. There have been time I have recieved negative news from doctors but that's just part of life. 
0.547600	When I visit a doctor I feel the most anxious at the waiting. Waiting for the doctor to arrive and waiting to receive information about my condition. I wish the process was much quicker so I wouldn't have time to worry something awful might happen.
0.142900	I worry most that a disease may be found that is terminal or that I may need to have surgery. I also get nervous when tests are taken just because I hate waiting for the results
0.166700	I feel most anxious about physical pain and examinations that may be ackward or embarassing. I've had two babies and found the exams to be surprising in their frequency and in the way they were not properly explained to me beforehand. I know it's routine to them but it's not to me.
0.690500	I'm in pretty good health, but my family genes worry me when I go in. I feel as though that coupled with my sometimes bad diet is finally going to catch up to me. That is what worries me when I go in for tests and bloodwork the most right now as I'm getting older.
0.190500	the only thing that makes me anxious if when I have to get any type of shot or have to have my blood drawn. I think this makes me feel anxious as I never look forward to having this done. 
0.142900	I rarely feel anxious or worried when i visit the doctor's office. The only time i might be anxious or worried is if i have received negative test results and am going in to discuss them. 
0.428600	I have a great doctor I just don't like going in general so that tends to make me feel anxious, but he's efficient and answers my questions and I usually leave wondering why I was so stressed out
0.404800	There is a lot of anxiety simply in not knowing for sure if your specific doctor (or your doctor that day) has your best interest at heart. They could be having a bad day, and overlook a serious problem. They could not take your truthful complaints serious, and give you a false clean bill of health. There is so much uncertainty at any given moment, it is impossible to not be nervous, worried, or anxious. 
0.142900	I worry that I may catch something from another patient like the flu while at the doctors office. If I'm having an unusual pain I worry that maybe something is really wrong and I'm about to find out what it is from my doctor.
0.333300	Finding out something bad might be wrong with me. One time I went over back pain and found out I had herniated discs in my back that also causes sciatica now
0.595200	Sometimes something will be wrong with me, and we will have to wait for lab results to help figure out what is going on.  This does scare me the most.  Also, when I had one issue, it wound up later being diagnosed as bladder cancer.  The symptoms were very scary, but she did help calm me down and had me come back every day to make sure the symptoms were getting better.  
0.690500	Every time i go with some pain, i am thinking the worst case scenario. I dont like going to doctors office at all.
0.714300	I'm of course worried about receiving bad news.  And also of feeling like the experience itself wasn't very good.  I want to feel important and respected, and I rarely feel that way at the doctor's office.
0.381000	I'm not used to people poking me and prodding me. I also realize that I'm often being judged by my outside (since I don't wear makeup, will they assume I'm depressed?), that my outside figure doesn't reflect my habits (yes, I weight 175 lbs. And, yes, I go running multiple times a week. Both are true), and that some of my statements will be considered lies (people believe me when I say I don't smoke, they mostly believe me when they say I don't drink, but I'm pretty sure no one believes me when I tell them I'm a virgin). 
0.809500	The first thing that comes to mind is just having an appointment period. Time is precious to me and I am generally kept waiting much longer than my time. I understand this can be necessary but I don't appreciate it every time.  Next, the fear of getting a flu or cold just by visiting the office makes me very anxious. I do worry about how the visit  will go such as if I will get bad news or a lecture. I really dread the lectures. 
0.238100	I hate needles! When I have to get a needle I get panicky. It's hard to explain because I have tattoos but, needles at the doctors are so different.
0.738100	I feel most anxious or worried when I have symptoms that might indicate a serious health condition. One of my doctor's nurses is a little unfriendly, so I feel anxious if she is the one who takes my vitals or draws my blood. Also, I feel worried about catching the flu from other patients at the doctor's office.
0.261900	The idea that whatever is ailing me could be a terminal illness but those thoughts don't enter too often.
0.642900	I get anxious about what medical conditions that the doctor might discover and the treatments that might be suggested.
0.547600	i feel it a little bit of anxious or worried and it is due to the uncertainty that i feel that what can happen and imagine the worst case .
0.357100	What makes me a little bit worried about visiting the doctors office is that he will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of.
0.381000	When I was pregnant last year i went to see my doctor very often and I was always worried about being told there was something wrong with the baby. I didn't really care about me as much as i cared about my baby
0.690500	Finding out that is something seriously wrong with me is usually the top worry of mine. You could be feeling fine but there may be an underlying issue that you didn't even realize was present. The cost of going to the doctor is also something that I worry about since my insurance is not that good.
0.166700	I don't like appointments and I prefer to get them over with and move on with the rest of my day as quickly as possible.
0.476200	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office would be finding out if i have some sort of illness that may have gone undetected.
0.571400	That I will have to get shots or blood drawn. Those both make me nervous, or that someone will say something about my physical condition that is negative like I need to lose weight or I will get diabetes or something.
0.881000	I am just always afraid I am going to be told I have some sort of cancer or disease. I grew up with a Nana who was VERY OFTEN hospitalized and spent a lot of time there visiting her. She had a myriad of health conditions and I'm just afraid I'll end up like that no matter how much I watch what I eat and take care of myself.
0.642900	I have an anxiety disorder, and it's actually the waiting room that's the biggest issue for me. It's always full of other patients and there are no windows and only one exit. I have one of those faces where I seem approachable, and people always try to talk to me which makes it worse.
0.595200	Not knowing what he will find, and the cost of any treatment that might need to be done. My family has a history of health issues and I am afraid I might follow suit.
0.309500	I just worry that something could be wrong even though I know there's little chance of that being the case.
0.357100	If I am sick, I am always anxious about what it could be and also I feel anxious that I may catch the flu or a stomach bug from someone who is there. This is something that makes me most anxious. 
0.523800	When I go to the doctors office, I will often feel a bit anxious. This is mostly because there are plenty of illnesses that can come up unexpectedly and I'm afraid that something bad will happen to me.
0.714300	I am a very private person so talking to anyone about health issues usually causes me some anxiety.  Also, I am relatively healthy and only have to go to the doctor on rare occasions, so it's just not something I am used to.
0.381000	I am afraid that I will embarrass myself, that they will discover something wrong with me that requires painful treatment or puts my life in danger, or that some aspect of the examination will be painful 
0.714300	I just worry that they're going to find something really bad, that I'm going to be sick with something deadly. 
0.547600	I feel most anxious about my weight when visit the doctor. I am always struggling with my weight and I hate to see the number on the scale, it fills me with dread. 
0.595200	I have a hard time comprehending people talking at me. I can't focus no matter how hard I try. I usually try remember key words and look up stuff later. They just get so rushed I don't want to be rude and keep interrupting. So I feel useless sometimes. And passed off that after 35 years of the pain no has an explanation.
0.857100	I always feel anxious when going to the doctor no matter if it is just for a physical and nothing serious. I always dread getting bad news.
0.452400	The unknown is the biggest source of worry or anxiety that I have whenever I have to visit the doctor's office.
0.190500	I always dislike going for my physical because of the thorough examination given,  and then having to have blood drawn.
0.738100	I have generalized anxiety disorder so doctors appts for me while necessary tend to bring stress and anxiety. I become anxious about what my weight will be, what my blood pressure will be (most likely high due to the anxiety) etc. I just tend to be a very anxious person even when there is nothing to really worry about. 
0.428600	How I will be treated by the doctor and if the doctor will give me the right diagnoses. I hate to have to deal with doctors who believe their patients are too stupid to know whats going on with them and who will not listen to the patient.
0.833300	When I am visiting the doctor's office,the things that make me feel most anxious or worried is first of all, not knowing what the actual problem is and worrying if my ailment is something that could be quite serious. I also become anxious and worried,wondering if I would be referred for additional testing,or perhaps to specialists for my ailment. Lastly, I get worried and anxious about the cost of my medical care. I am limited as to what I can afford to pay for my health care.
0.738100	That the doctor will be rude or one of the nurses will be rude. Im a little on the heavier side, and they have to weigh me every visit and its really frustrrating. I know its so they can keep me on track of weight and stuff but its really embarrassing stepping on the scale and every time i gain weight.
0.690500	Not knowing if something is wrong with me or that something is wrong with me. Fear of receiving needles. 
0.690500	I suppose I sometimes think about the potentially worst case scenario for a given situation, and that may lead to some anxiety. Even if hypothetical, some visits may reveal an unexpected diagnosis, but on the other end of the spectrum everything may be fine. I suppose this is a situation that falls under the whole idea of hope for the best but expect the worst.
0.547600	The only time I am anxious   when I visit the doctor is when I am expecting bad news. It could be when I am expecting a bad result because of recent events or symptoms
0.285700	Nothing really makes me feel anxious at all when I go to the doctor suprisingly I have always had good checkups and no major health issues. 
0.214300	Getting in and out! I am disabled and for some reason the office does not have an automatic door. Once in though, I feel quite relaxed. I know my doctor is there to help me in a non-judgmental way and I feel quite safe in his hands. His staff is also very helpful and caring, which makes any visit quite stress free.
0.857100	That something is seriously wrong or that there is not going to be a clear answer to a problem or a clear resolution. 
0.190500	I feel most anxious about finding out what is wrong with me and what I will need to do to treat it. I do not like not knowing what is going on with my health.

0.690500	The main thing that causes anxiety for me when going in for a doctors visit is the financial consequences that might come from my visit. I have had bad experiences with insurance companies in the past and not being told upfront what I can expect to pay out-of-pocket. The other worry that arises is not knowing what kind of treatment I can expect and the time and effort that I might have to invest to treat the problem. 
0.833300	I feel uneasy if i am visiting a doctor and do not know what the test results will conclude. Also, I feel more uneasy to be examined by doctors when they perform more invasive testing (prodding/poking). If it's just a routine checkup, then i usually feel much easier/relaxed about it. 
0.238100	Just waiting in the waiting room and the chances of getting sick because you are at a doctors office make me uneasy but it does not really have to do with the doctor themselves 
0.404800	Wondering if there's any new condition or if I am as healthy as I try to be. Hoping nothing comes up that would require a prescription or any medication that I can't remedy myself. I just hope all of my exams have good and positive results meaning good health.
0.476200	I am usually not that nervous or anxious when visiting any doctor but, am not that excited or comfortable either. I dont have any particular feelings it's just neccesary.
0.595200	i've had high blood pressure and chest pains. i've had pretty serious kidney stones. when i go to the doctor because of some pain, at my age i always worry whether it might be heart disease or cancer. haven't had anything that serious yet, thankfully.
0.571400	It's always nerve wrecking when I visit a doctor's office because I don't know if there is something wrong with me. Most of it is the wait after you are examined and waiting for the results to come to me.
0.500000	I went to the emergency room several months ago because my feet were swollen for a few weeks and it was painful for me to walk or stand. In addition to the pain and swelling there was a very aggressive rash on both feet. After sitting in the ER for hours, the doctor told me I had athlete's foot. I followed his instructions and took the medications and one weeks later the condition only got worse. I went to my physician and was then told the problem was an extension of my eczema and that he would put in a referral for me  to see a dermatologist. After a few reminders and months later, I am still waiting to see a dermatologist.
0.142900	I don't really feel anxious when visiting the doctor. Sometimes there's a weird feedback loop when taking blood pressure where I'm almost nervous that if I'm feeling nervous about my blood pressure being high I'll get an inaccurately high reading, which makes me a little nervous. It's pretty dumb and the nurse and I laugh about it.
0.809500	I don't always know what the doctor is going to tell me when I am there for a visit. There is no way of telling and they can sometimes be very blunt when telling you things that can really upset you. Once again, it goes back to their insane workload and the fact that they don't really have the time to form a genuine rapport with their patients.
0.857100	The things that make me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is I usually already know that it is going to be something bad, and I fear what I will be told and than the next course of action. I have many medical issues and most don't simply just go away on there own.
0.595200	If I have some unknown pain I might think it is cancer or some other bad disease, but I have been lucky that I haven't had these conditions.
0.452400	The only things that makes me feel anxious or worried are the results I may receive, sometimes I personally go and google my symptoms ( which isn't always the smartest thing to do) and it usually gives me some of the worse diagnosis of what could potentially be ailing me. So when I get to the doctor's office my mind is always focused on those things I've read it could be. So I be anxious to get seen to be told what it really is and worried that it's one of the things I think it is.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is think if I'm going to feel any pain or any discomfort.
0.857100	I have intense anxiety anyway just normally anyway. Doctors certainly make it worse. A lot of it is simply discomfort around the stranger. Another part is the vulnerability. 
0.309500	I tend to be relaxed when visiting the doctor's office, unless dealing with a unique situation that may carry anxiety with it - ie illness, new physical sympton etc.
0.190500	I am comfortable at the doctors office now that I have a doctor that I am confident in. Having a Dr who wont listen to me or who dismisses my symptomology is what makes me most uncomfortable at the dr
0.190500	I naturally become anxious when I see doctors. My blood pressure is normally on the lower side, although it is still normal. When I go to my doctor, my blood pressure rises to 120/80 which, again, is still normal, but not MY normal blood pressure when I am relaxed. Also, I am worried he will be disappointed in slow weight loss since I began losing weight in February 2017.
0.309500	If I'm not sure what is wrong with me. I will start overthinking it, or even worse using Web-MD before I go to get an estimate of what might be wrong. Nothing the doctor does makes me anxious, I make myself nervous.
0.571400	I am always worried that a doctor will find something wrong that I never knew existed, like cancer or a sexually transmitted disease.  I fear the worst news.
0.428600	I don't too much get anxious or worried during a doctor visit. I am normally completely at ease. I trust my provider so I;m sure that helps ease any worry or anxiety
0.309500	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.  I don't usually have a reason to be.  I know what to expect with my doctors.  They are straight forward and honest with me.  They will go over all of my options with me and discuss pros and cons of all of those options to help me to make an informed decision so there usually isn't a reason to be worried.
0.357100	Being examined is an anxiety-inducing experience. There's a lot of uncertainty about what the results could be. Going to see a doctor is also anxiety-inducing in itself.
0.714300	That what the doctor diagnoses me with is serious or untreatable. Also, the environment itself in a doctors office usually makes me anxious or worried. 
0.428600	Most of the time when I visit the doctor for anything other than routine physicals, I don't always feel I know how my treatment will go. It seems sometimes I have left the doctor's office being no closer to healed than I was when I entered.
0.142900	What causes me anxiety at a doctor's office?  A request for a blood sample, or the need to have an IV.  I really do not care for needles or for blood draws.  Not sure exactly why, but both are something that I would prefer to avoid.
0.619000	I am overweight and I know the doctor will ridicule me about it. It is also always uncomfortable to have an exam or get blood drawn. It is not something I look forward to.
0.500000	I feel shy around strangers or people I don't know well. Additionally, I do not like needles, so the idea of getting blood drawn makes me tense. 
0.666700	You never know what they may find.  I always fear the cost of follow up appointments and the potential time that will be wasted.  Definitely not convenient.
0.761900	The idea of receiving bad news is what makes me the most anxious and uneasy when going to the doctor's office. I hate the feeling even though I know it is necessary for me to get a physical examination.
0.785700	If I'm going in for a check-up i would fear finding out something bad (i.e. diabetes, cancer). I also worry if they may have found something or if my physical condition is more serious that what i personally think. 
0.714300	I'm afraid that my doctor is going to mess with my medications because they try that every few years.  I am concerned I am going to walk out with referrals to a bunch more doctors and/or more unnecessary testing.  
0.857100	Why not feel anxious?  I might have some sort of disease and I don't like anyone touching me period.  I hate going to the hospital it's a depressing place to be.
0.785700	I am always scared they will tell me I am overweight first off. Then just the initial exam I am afraid that I will have some sort of disease that is really bad because I am terrified of death.
0.428600	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office is that I will be informed with information that details that I have a serious illness that may require drastic treatment or may have no treatment process that is successful at all. I do not like to take prescription medicines If I do not have too. I become fearful for my own health and would make decisions onwards that I hope will only benefit my health and help me move down a process of recovery. I would have faith in my doctor and hope that he/she takes the necessary precautions/procedures to help my recover from my illness as well. 
0.142900	I don't like waiting in the waiting room. But I especially hate waiting in the examining room where it is so cold and there's nothing to do while you wait. Plus the visits are too short to delve into any problems you may have. The doctors are always in a big hurry to see as many patients as they can so you feel like you're not anything special. I wouldn't care if the doctor just pretended to be interested in my problems as long as he/she showed any interest at all.
0.142900	The main thing that makes me feel anxious about going to the doctor would be if I were waiting for test results to determine if something was wrong with my health and what was wrong with my health.
0.666700	I am worried that I will not understand what the doctor is talking about, especially if something is wrong with me. I am anxious about whether or not the doctor will take me seriously. 
0.619000	My main concern is to find out that I have some really serious disease. However it is always better to know and start looking for the treatment or the setup a plan than not being aware and realizing it too late. The other thing that is very upsetting is the costs of the treatments. It is always expensive to go to the doctor and getting the necessary examinations. I do not understand how people are able to afford medical treatments. It is way to overpriced and after that you will live and work to pay back the costs of your medical treatment.
0.428600	I hate shots. I am an adult and I just hate them. I get queasy and I know it is coming. I worry also about my insurance covering everything due to a medical bill in the past. 
0.404800	Sometimes I worry about cancer or some other condition.  I am aware of a bunch of people I either know well or that are in my work/social circle that have had gall bladder problems.  I worry about that.  
0.690500	I think it has to do with the waiting and all the thoughts and ideas that enter my mind. The longer i am waiting the more harder it is to stay calm. Feeling anxious and wanting to get it over with.
0.666700	I am most worried that I will be very sick because of an unwise activity I've engaged in or it will in some way be my fault. I do not want the doctor to judge me based on that. 
0.619000	I feel most anxious when the physicians ask me questions but then act as if they don't believe what I am telling them, whatever it may be.
0.309500	I fear having something really serious be discovered about my symptoms. For example, a few years ago I had frequent migraines and my doctor suggested that I get further testing down just to stay on the safe side. I was afraid there was a tumor. 
0.619000	I'm afraid she will find something serious and then I will have to make decisions on what to do. I prefer not to think about such things.
0.357100	I think it's the atmosphere of doctors offices/hospitals that make me anxious. It always seems to be associated with health problems and that makes me feel that I have problems.
0.619000	I worry that the doctor may miss something, or conversely, find something serious. I also worry that I will forget to ask the doctor about certain things.
0.500000	That would be getting bad news that I have a terminal illness or issue. Also just the rooms and materials in the office make me very anxious.
0.738100	I very nervous/ anxious to talk to him about my chronic pain. He gets very gruff and makes a mean face. I don't think Alabama believes in pain management. 
0.381000	The fear of finding out that there might be something more serious about my condition:). However, this is not always the case, it is only if I am seeing a doctor about a serious illness. 
0.381000	I am not anxious all the time, I was thinking more of a particular situation. I was having blood count issues. I had to keep going back for blood draws to see what my counts were at. one of the diagnosis for what i was going though could have been cancer. I was very nervous about getting those results
0.928600	I have always been afraid of going to the doctor.  I am very fearful of pain and doctor's visits always has been related to pain in my mind. I think  I have phobia maybe.
0.547600	I don't like having people i don't know well touching me. I also have a small fear that the visit will result in the knowledge that I have a large medical problem.
0.142900	I don't have much fear or worry when I go to the doctor. I used to, before I started trusting Jesus. Now that I do trust Jesus, I give all my worries and concerns to him. I just go to the doctor for checkups, and I deal with whatever is said the best way I can.
0.738100	I am afraid that they will find something wrong with me that will be difficult to treat such as cancer, or that they won't look into my health needs as much as I'd like them too
0.523800	I don't like waiting for the doctor. I feel uncomfortable. I can also feel anxious about finding what is wrong with me
0.642900	When I have been examined my overall health condition, especially I have been screened for cancer, I felt most anxious and worried whether I had some symptom of cancer or uncured disease.     
0.690500	Whenever I visit a doctors office I feel most nervous that the doctor is going to tell me to do something which will not help my condition or better understand my condition but instead just prescribe whatever is most fashionable or lucrative for himself. I am concerned that my best interest will not be taken into consideration. I am concerned about harmful and poorly understood medications being prescribed to me. 
0.619000	I guess just generally I don't want to find out that I'm sick because I don't have any money. I know that hospitals do tend to lower the costs for people with extremely low income like myself, but I'm scared to have to deal with that. 
0.333300	I'm mostly anxious about getting my blood drawn or shots. Sometimes I am anxious when the waiting area is very crowded, because I'm not sure when I will be seen and hope not to be rushed. Occasionally if I have a lot of concerns I'm worried I'll forget to ask everything on my mind.
0.523800	Just the thought of going to the doctor always has made me nervous and a fear of needles and such. Once I am in and see the doctor I am fine. 
0.381000	I have to be weighed and I never lose weight.  I have to let the doctor feel me in places I would rather not have anyone touch.  I have to reveal myself to an almost complete stranger.
0.881000	The possibility of my doctor diagnosing a health condition that could possibly change my life causes a lot of anxiety for me. I am also a very private person and do not like having someone probe my life and body during an exam.
0.166700	I don't feel anxious or worried at all when I go to the doctors. I might feel a little upset if there if a long wait and this might also make a little anxious.
0.523800	Waiting for them to examine me and tell me something is wrong with me.  While waiting, my mind jumps to crazy conclusions like I am dying of some disease or I have tumors growing somewhere.  These thoughts kind of make my heart rate go up and he ends up thinking i have high blood pressure.
0.571400	Usually it's just dealing with the doctor and potentially telling them that they're wrong if they were to simply give me medicine with a thousand sides effects that hide the real problem one might have. 
0.571400	I feel most anxious about getting shots because of the pain , and the awkwardness of the situation . I am also worried the doctors may find issues with my health which can be very life changing .
0.809500	mainly not knowing what might be found since in our family history we have a little bit of everything that has come up in one form or another. 
0.285700	I'm not really usually very worried when visiting a doctor's office.  However there is always the back of the mind fear that they may discover or see something that is not what I came in for. Additionally, when I have blood tests I sometimes fear that they may discover something that is wrong that could be caused by cancer or some other major illness.
0.142900	Nothing makes me feel anxious at the doctors office. I take any of the bad news to come with stride and try and have a positive outlook whenever I visit the doctors office. I do not fear checkups or any examinations.
0.690500	Mainly worried they will be giving me bad news. A lot of bad diseases, cancer, heart conditions, etc, are in my family. 
0.833300	I get scared because I worry about what might be wrong. I get all worked up about it. I'm worried about having to take a new medication or if there might be something seriously wrong with me. It really freaks me out.
0.714300	When you visit a doctor's office, it's usually because something is wrong, unless it is for preventative purposes. The anxiety and worry are related to the uncertainty of your condition and the uncertainty of whether it can be treated, or what kind of treatments are available. There is anxiety and worry when visiting a doctor's office because the doctor might not be able to help you, they may not give a lot of time for your visit and rush to see another patient when you still feel unsure about how to proceed. The doctor might not have confidence in treating you and that is also scary.
0.142900	The most frustrating occurrence is the never-ending rotation of doctors.  It seems every year, (interns) I have to go through my entire history again.  Including, family, life, medical, etc.  Then, a new diagnosis, new medications, and so on, and so on.
0.642900	I feel anxious or worried that the doctor might find something wrong with me.  Anxious because I might feel pain during the exam or the test given to me.
0.714300	I am worried that the doctor might inform me of some horrible health news that will ruin my life. I am worried about getting some horrible news that could mean the end of my life.
0.357100	Whenever i feel anxious seeing my doctor its generally due to me not knowing how much information or what information specifically i should release to her even though im fully aware i should tell her everything due to HIPA and the confidnetiality it provides. I still have anxiety however with certain things like mental state etc. 
0.666700	What makes me feel anxious is being diagnosed with an incurable illness such as Cancer or MS. Also, if they are not able to diagnose what's going on with me
0.523800	While logically I know that there's likely nothing wrong with me, the last visit I had involved being diagnosed with PTSD. It was a bit of a soul-crusher to have had that confirmed, because I sort of knew that I did for the month leading up to the visit.
0.833300	I never know what they will find wrong with me.  Or if they will find a cyst and want to do more tests that cost more money. 
0.309500	I am mainly anxious when i visit a dr because I am afraid I am going to have bad news leaving. I am terrified that I am going to be diagnosed with an illness I will not be able to treat or get proper treatment for.
0.714300	Generally what makes me feel most anxious is when I know I have something wrong but I can not match an illness to the symptoms. 
0.238100	I worry when there is a waiting time before diagnosis. I have had 3 or 4 good scares in my life, liver failure and cancer. I am not the kind of person that will freak out on possibly fatal news like that.  The other thing was needles. I used to become quite anxious when waiting. 
0.881000	I often feel like they will rush me and not listen to what I have to say or that they will write me off as a hypochondriac.
0.595200	Mainly because I have awful anxiety, I worry about everything so it's in my nature to worry about a million different things.  Also, I've been battling against my weight for a while.  I just never know if my doctor is going to be proud of my progress that I've made since I've last visited or if he's going to be disappointed that I'm not losing weight faster.
0.761900	When I go for my yearly exam and it involves female stuff I hate it. It is uncomfortable for the patient and for the Doctor. Plus it is somewhat painful. Then there is the breast exam. I don't like anyone seeing me undressed much less touching me in a private area. I am always so relieved when it is over and I am walking out all dressed!
0.142900	i would say the wait to see if you are ok like your blood work your blood pressure your ox your heart your weight
0.142900	If I believe beforehand that there is something seriously wrong with me BEFORE I talk to the doctor, then I might feel anxious as I wait to see him and talk to him. But that is rare. I  do not usually feel anxious while I am talking to the doctor. I usually just let him examine me and listen closely  to what he tells me. But I do not tend to overreact to things. If he , on the other hand, told me Ihave some deadly disease that cannot be treated, obviously I would feel rather anxious.
0.714300	Sometimes I worry that something may be seriously wrong with me, in which case I would rather not know. But it makes me anxious not knowing, so I have to know if anything might be wrong with me.
0.285700	I donât feel nothing at all so I donât know how to answer this question... will get through whatever the outcome is 
0.547600	I am a person that gets worried every time i go to the doctor.  I'm just afraid i will hear something bad while there.  Normally, everything is just fine and once i get into the examination room i start to relax.  Maybe, its all the other people in the waiting room, the long waits, ect that make me anxious.  
0.547600	It depends on what has been going on with me lately. I know when I haven't been trying to take care of myself in terms of diet and exercise and fear what the doctor will say about the results of some of those little examinations. If I also have some kind of sickness I've never dealt with before, I can start to feel fairly anxious. 
0.381000	I'm afraid that they aren't going to really listen to what I have to say.  I am afraid that they will give me a generic answer to my problems instead of asking me more questions just to make sure it isn't a more serious problem.
1.000000	I fear that I will be sick and that insurance will not cover it. I feel that the offices make me sick. I also think the doctor wants to get me in trouble with the insurance company so I lose my plan.
0.523800	If i'm going to have a procedure done or a surgery i'm obviously going to be nervous and worried. That's always how it works for me. When going in for a routine exam i'm not usually worried, however.
0.666700	At age 72, and having a number of health issues, I accept the fact that time is running out for me.  I always feel tense with each medical exam as the likelihood of the onset of a potentially lethal condition would not be surprising at my age.
0.714300	It is the fear of being judged and of not knowing if they will find anything wrong with me. Perhaps they will judge my lifestyle, or perhaps they will say I am eating all the wrong things or not exercising enough.
0.238100	What makes me feel most anxious about visiting a doctor is a general anxiety of being in public places in general, along with the likelihood of being undressed. Also, I usually only visit a doctor is there is a problem, so there is some anxiety as to what the problem may be.
0.881000	My biggest fear is that of being told that I have an incurable disease or only have a few months to live.  I think my fear is that my mother died when I was young and my father was very sick as I was growing up.
0.547600	I worry I will be scolded for having poor self-care. I worry that they will find out I am actually quite sick. Also, I am generally nervous around many people who are authorities and I have a strong desire to look as though I know a lot, but I don't actually know much about the medical field.
0.833300	Just listening to what my Doctor is telling me about my impairments. There is usually never any improvement and no signs of possible or potential improvement. It is essentially my Doctor telling me that I will probably have these issues for the remainder of my life. 
0.547600	That the doctor will detect something that could be life threatening at the least. Even if it not life threatening if I was told that I would have to radically alter my life style such as activities or diet I would find it as a great disruption. At least at first.
0.309500	Always makes me nervous to see a doctor, although my health is quite good.  Probably left over from child hood when I would have to go because of something stupid I did.
1.000000	"Even though I have a ""good"" insurance plan, I am in constant fear that something unaffordable will happen at the doctor's office. If the doctor decides to send me to a lab, imaging center, or hospital, it might be out of network or there might be some other loophole that will give my insurance company an excuse not to pay. A prescription might be on some arbitrary list causing my insurance to deny it. Even the doctors fees might be mishandled by the insurance company. There is no way to comparison shop or get an estimate of fees beforehand. As a patient I am at the mercy of a healthcare system rapaciously seeking to squeeze every possible dollar of profit out of me."
0.642900	What makes me most anxious or worried is that they will find something unexpected or recommend an invasive procedure.
0.690500	I am usually a little worried that they will find something wrong. Especially since so many of my recent visits have been prenatal - I always worry about the health of the baby. 
0.238100	Waiting. Once I am back in the exam room I'm usually ok. The only other thing was expressing how bad I felt knowing it was something other than the flu or general fatigue and worry about not being able to express it because I am such a strong person that doesn't show weakness so its hard for me to really break down and let people know I feel horrible.
0.523800	Depending what the visit is for would determine how anxious or worried I would be. I think what makes me most worried would be being concerned the doctor would find something I was unaware of, or something potentially serious. This worries me sometimes.
0.381000	It's the uncertainty of it all that's nerve-wracking. You second-guess yourself and maybe something is wrong and maybe you lose sight of the truth and start to fear random things.
0.619000	I'm 55 and haven't had a medical issue in decades. While I do exercise regularly and eat well; I've smoked for 20 years and drink regularly so if I had an issue I'd be concerned as I'm far from a person who you'd consider has a healthy life-style.
0.714300	What makes me most worried and anxious is that they'll find something seriously wrong with me, like cancer.
0.261900	I get anxious going to the doctor's office mainly because of any uncertainty as to what is wrong, plus the doctor's office itself makes me anxious, just the smell.
0.476200	Some doctors do not value patients' time. They never see patients at the time of the appointment and they do not offer anything to read.
0.666700	The overall institutional feel makes me feel uncomfortable. I also do not like sitting by myself in a quiet room for thirty minutes before the doctor comes in, giving me ample time to worry though every possible thing they could say. 
0.214300	The thing that probably makes me feel the most anxious is when my doctor finds something potentially wrong that I didn't know about, especially if it could potentially be a really big deal.  At one point he was worried about a mole I had on my skin being potential melanoma so he removed it and had it tested.  The test came back negative, but the roughly 1 week it took to get the results was nerve-wracking.  
0.142900	I don't usually feel upset or worried when visiting my doctor's office.  The last time I had blood work done I was a little nervous to get the results of the tests back, but they made me feel at ease and told me ways to improve my numbers and things I could do to better my health overall. 
0.214300	I feel neither anxious nor worried when visiting the doctor's office. In fact, I feel like the doctors are not going to look hard enough or listen intently enough and under- or misdiagnose me.
0.333300	I only worry about cancer, since it seems to be the hidden disease that pops up on people sometimes without warning.  This is about the only thing that worries me that one day it will show up on some sort of test.  
0.500000	I can feel anxious regarding when I have to wait for a test result as if its something that could mean there could be adverse results for long term.
0.333300	Just the atmosphere in general. I have no real issues or reasons to feel anxiety. It's probably more from childhood feelings or the idea of a hospital.
0.809500	I hate visiting the doctors office because 1) I hate getting on the scale. 2) I hate getting shots or my fingers pricked. 3) The nurses are usually rude. 4) My doctor does not know much about me. I feel like he knows my name but does not care about me or does not care much about my health. 5) My doctor has not helped me get the right type of anxiety medicine that I have been wanting. All of it makes me tired and I just need something that calms me down.
0.214300	I feel anxious about any examination in general. Being checked out physically can be a little stressful for me. I don't like being poked and prodded. 
0.452400	What makes me feel anxious is not knowing rather I did good of bad when it comes time to check my diabetes and what the results will show.  I dont follow what i am supposed to be doing on a regular basis so everytime i usually get anxious about it and what my doctor will think. Also when going to the doctor sick people are in there and i dont want to catch what they have like strep, cold or even worse this years Flu. 
0.833300	I feel anxious and worried when i will have to visit Doctor as I am afraid if any other deseases may come to my notice apart from the one for which i wished to consult doctor and also if the doctor confirms my ailment as the one which cant be treated or there is no treatment that leads to frighten me.
0.142900	nothing because I trust that my life is in good hands with my doctor so there is no use trying to worry myself and have worse nerves than i need for nothing
0.547600	i get worried about finding out something about my health that totally blindsides me, or that ended up in a poor state due to lack of action on my part.
0.738100	"My doctor is a part of the LDS Church, and I am too, but not ""active."" He is a high council member in the Church and has pressured me and tells me I need to go to my Ward (or church). I can't make this stuff up. I felt it stepped over the line or patient/physician relationship. It make me really anxious to go to another appt with him because I knew he would know I haven't been to church, or paid tithing, etc."
0.714300	I am very uncomfortable when going to any doctor. I don't like people touching me and going to the doctor it is usually a given that there is going to be someone touching me. 
0.285700	Anything involving needles. I have a HUGE needle phobia that has oftentimes prevented me from getting typical blood work or vaccines.
0.571400	"What asinine charges are they going to bring up? Am I going to be charged because they used a gauze pad to cover a wound (should I have brought my own)? Are they going to find cause to put me through the most useless, expensive tests, because they ""feel"" there is some issue worth investigating? Are they even going to bother prescribing the correct medicines, or has some drug company paid them an exorbitant fee to prescribe their medicine above all others, even when that medication is unnecessary/not fit for the condition/better options are available?"
0.642900	I feel anxious or worried when I feel I haven't followed the doctor's instructions properly or have been lax regarded my own health. When I am disappointed in myself, I am anxious in anticipation of telling the doctor the problem, because I don't want him to be disappointed in me.
0.976200	Something about the look of doctor's offices, I also don't like them to touch me. I am afraid of pain. I was upset and scared last time I was in the hospital. 
0.285700	I am usually nervous and anxious during my doctor's appointment. My blood pressure is almost always higher when it is being measured by the nurse. I guess I want to unconsciously be as healthy as possible and can sense judgement of some sort - or maybe it is all in my head.
0.404800	Usually it has to do with seeing how much weight I have gained. Other than that, my anxiousness could only be due to the unknown. But I have full trust in my PCP. 
0.738100	The lack of compassion. Most doctors don't care about the patient. They just want to push drugs on you and get you out of the door instead of reviewing your background and the things you have tried that was either successful or failed. We have records for a reason and no one seems to read them. I hate having to start from scratch with each doctor I see. 
0.690500	Worried that they will find something wrong that would require expensive treatments or hinder my standard of living that would put a burden on my family and friends
0.142900	I do not worry when I go to the doctor's.  I know it is necessary for my health.  I have confidence that my doctor will listen to my complaints and proscribe the necessary and correct treatments.
0.500000	Uncertainty about potentially bad things.  Moles that could be cancer, things of that nature.  When I don't understand or know what is going on with my own body, that brings anxiety.
0.285700	It depends what i am going in for. i think that if i am already unsure about something regarding my health, the unease will already be there.
0.642900	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious is the initial greeting and how the conversation starts off because lately I haven't been taking the best care of myself, so I'm always really nervous to find out how much worse things have gotten with either my weight or cholesterol numbers.
0.738100	I get most anxious because I don't know what the outcome of the appointment will be. I also don't know how the doctor will treat me while I am there.
0.142900	I am currently diagnosed with a chronic condition.  The thing that makes me the most anxious or worried is finding out that my health has gotten worse rather than stayed stable.
0.404800	I've come from a history of cancer in my mothers side of my family. I would feel worried of anxious if they would diagnosis with something in that range. I have small children so I feel that I have to be here to guide them in to their adulthood.
0.333300	for example, a pain that I have never felt in my body, the delivery of blood tests, that the doctor who regularly treats me does not treat me, I find out that something is not right with my body.
0.333300	I ALWAYS FEEL A LITTLE ANXIOUS AND WORRIED BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT HE MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG.
0.666700	I dont like going to the doctor if I can avoid it. It makes me think maybe something is wrong. I would rather be finished and find out what is the diagnosis
0.809500	Whenever I'm in a doctor's office, hospital, or clinic setting, I just have an uneasy feeling in general.  Doctor's offices and hospitals make me nervous as I associate them with health problems and pain.  I often feel worried when waiting for results as I'm nervous to see if they have good or bad news for me regarding my health.  I usually rely on a doctor's demeanor or personality to help comfort and relax me in these types of situations.
0.452400	I have had poor past experiences with doctors that automatically makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, even though I trust my current doctor. Just being in a doctor's office setting seems to trigger the anxiety.
0.452400	I feel most anxious that they might tell me something is wrong with my condition when I thought everything had been fine. I worry about over-prescription instead of fixing the root issue, I think we medicate far too much in this society.
0.500000	The feeling that they will judge me for my life choices, even if I strongly believe they are the right choices for me. I don't tend to do things willy nilly. I try and do my research and make sure I have informed opinion or choice in something I personally participate in. I don't always eat right, and even if I eat bad once a  month, I would feel like I need to justify my decisions to my doctor. I also have a general sense of anxiety, so any unknown situation will make me worries, usually for no good reason. 
0.619000	When visiting the doctors office, I am nervous about seeing my doctor because of the poor relationship we have, as well as what he might tell my mother. Im not a fan of needles either, so when getting a shot it freaks me out. The anxiety lasts for about half of the visit, once I realize that im going to be ok i level out and calm down. I should realize this before I even get into the doctors office, but it still freaks me out. Maybe thats something Ill work on.
0.785700	Having someone who I do not see often look me over concerns me. I get anxious when they check my heart rate and such which probably contributes to my heart rate going up. They sometimes try to talk while checking my heart rate which makes me more anxious as I have to participate in a conversation.
0.738100	I have social anxiety so i have difficulty communicating at times. Having someone ask me personal questions or see me in a vulnerable position can make me feel uneasy. 
0.738100	My genetics/family health history is not great so I'm always a bit worried something's going to hit me out of nowhere as I get older.
1.000000	I often worry that they will find something seriously wrong with me or that I am going to die.  Even though I feel ok, I always dread that they might find something that canât be cured or they canât help to heal.
0.619000	I am always worried something else will be wrong with me than just what I am going in for...or that whatever I have is worse than what I think. Additionally, I am always worried about remembering the things I want to ask, and if I will have enough time to ask the questions I have. So it makes me really anxious and worried. 
0.357100	It is simply that factor of uncertainty. Even if you feel healthy you can never truly know if there is something wrong that can't be seen or felt. You always want to hear that you are healthy but you can't know if they are going to find something unusual.
0.214300	I sometimes just feel generally anxious when I visit the doctor's office - I feel that I suffer from 'white coat phenomena'. I sometimes notice that my blood pressure is elevated for no particular reason when I visit the doctor's office.
0.309500	The unknown makes me anxious and worried.  Not knowing what to expect or what the doctor will say in regards to an issue I've had.  I spend too much time researching online about various illnesses and going to see a doctor about it makes me very anxious.  No one wants to be given bad news so, not knowing exactly what will be said is very nerve-racking.
0.190500	Honestly the cost thereâs not much else other than that like I feel like going to a doctor making sure Iâm OK doing my research hoping they do their research but if they make mistakes that cost more money that is what frustrates the worries 
0.714300	sitting in a waiting room full of potential sick people. that he might charge me a unreasonably high amount etc,
0.476200	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is that he will tell me that I have a major illness or condition that will make it impossible to live my life the way I want to.
0.571400	I know that he is going to complain about my weight.  Then he is going to tell me that his wife put him on a diet and how small his plate is.  He will then tell me that his wife is blond and beautiful and that she knows what is best.  Then he will talk about his need to still lose ten pounds so that his wife will be proud of him.....every time I go see him.....same story.....
0.642900	I come from a family with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, and I'm always anxious when I go to the doctor that they'll find out I have one of these things.
0.785700	What makes me most anxious is the thought of something being seriously wrong with me. I avoid going to the doctor as much as possible just because I really do not want to know if there is something wrong with me.
0.881000	To hear any bad news like things are getting worse or that they don't have any other medicines/options to help my symptoms.
0.619000	That I am surprised of his decision, I want to trust my doctor, I want to know that he thinks about my case and tries to help me not thinking of his financial profit. The times are changing and humanity is so important for this profession. I worry every time how expensive will be the next prescribed medicine and what are the side effects, I try to read everything carefully and when read the long list of side effects I become more and more frustrated. Sometimes the doctor is thinking about something else and doesn't listen to me, I have to repeat what I have said, that is confusing. 
0.190500	I worry some about pain or invasive physical procedures. I worry about something serious being discovered. I worry about encountering new germs and getting sick from visiting the doctor's office!
0.333300	I feel anxious or worried because you never know what is going to come out of that visit. For one, I battle with high blood pressure. And at times my pressure would be elevated and others not. So when I go and see my doctor it always concerns me because one day Iâm taking pills and the next day I am not. Itâs nerve wracking even though I am considered healthly based off my physical exams.
0.238100	I do not feel worried when I go to the doctor.  I believe in a simple and necessary procedure that does not require any additional alarm.
0.738100	"My doctor says I have classic ""white coat syndrome"".  My blood pressure rises considerably and I am flushed when I first go in."
0.476200	I am most worried that the doctor is going to find something wrong with me that will require medicine or hospitalization. I also don't enjoy talking about my weight with the doctor.
0.142900	That the doctor will find something in a scan or in blood work that would lead me to making life or death decisions. I don't think I would be able to handle that right now in this day in age with everything else that is going on . 
0.333300	I think the things that make me feel anxious or worried is the doctor coming back saying something is wrong with my health. I also gets a little worried when he's going over test results and finding out I'm not doing recommended suggestions like exercise or eat righg. I worried that im gonna get fussed at by my doctor for being hard headed.
0.690500	I think it may be the atmosphere or the ambiance of the doctors office. Its too quiet and smells like disinfectant. Iâm always feeling a little anxious and nervous when I have an appointment even when itâs just a check up/physical. I donât know... Iâve never thought about why it is that I get nervous when I go to the doctors.
0.666700	I do not like the smell of the waiting room because it smells like the alcohol wipes. I also do not like waiting when I am just going for a checkup and I have to be around all the other sick people. I also just do not like shots and that makes me the most anxious.
0.714300	The biggest fear when going to the doctor is that something seriously wrong might be discovered. In fact, I have health anxiety, and the fear that a small normal sensation is cancer or some other disease is quite scary. That is what makes me nervous about visiting the doctor. 
0.333300	The results of tests or blood work and knowing the possibility of something major could be going on. 
0.928600	I am self conscious about my body, so I don't particularly like having to undress or show certain parts of my body. I don't like to be touched and I am also sometimes concerned with what my diagnoses could be or other things unrelated to the reason I am there that the doctor might find. 
0.238100	Because the only one that knows everything is God. For that reason I fell very anxious because no matter I'm healthy and fit and try to be doing the right thing you never know when your luck or the destiny is on you're side because when is you're time is you're time.
0.166700	Well I have the normal worry of hoping that I don't have a serious conditions when ever blood tests etc are done. We all want to avoid bad news and pain. I know the irony is that avoiding the doctor heightens our chance of bad news when we finally do go. I learned this first hand when I when I had the emergency, telling myself that the pain in my chest and difficulty breathing was nothing to worry about. It turned out to be more serious than I thought.
0.595200	"I think what makes me feel the most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me but my gut is telling me that I know more about what is actually wrong than what my doctor knows.  Sometimes I wish instead of just treating a million different symptoms, they'd just treat the cause or say ""Look honestly, I don't know what's wrong"".  "
0.857100	Just the thought that they might find something wrong or give me bad news about something.  Just going to the dr in general makes me a little nervous.
0.595200	I am afraid i'm going to get yelled at for something I have or have not done to take care of myself.
0.738100	I had thyroid cancer in the past and I need people who will pay attention to what I am saying and treat me as a patient and not as a disease 
0.500000	I know I am not in the greatest health. So when I go to the doctor's office I am quite worried that she may end up giving me bad news. I also have a family history of heart trouble, so I am very scared about that. 
0.571400	Just the unknown. I tend to be a bit of a worry-wart, so knowing everything will be ok and that I don't have X, Y or Z is always a relief. As I ge older, I realize the difference between being vigilent and attentive to one's own health and being a bit paranoid.
0.642900	Nothing foreal just wondering if something is really wrong with you.aBut u have to find out.Because it might be to late
0.500000	Not being able to know if something is wrong with me even though I feel quite healthy.  There could be something internal that we don't know and after doing blood tests are the times when I feel the most anxious to get the results back.
0.166700	Because I am male and my doctor is female and I am conscious of myself. I know she is a medical professional, but I just get a bit anxious. 
0.357100	I am overweight, so it just makes me anxious to have to weigh-in and discuss my weight with my doctor. It also makes me uneasy when I have to do things like pull up my shirt to have my stomach checked. 
0.738100	I am most worried about my doctor personally attacking me for my choices I have made. It is hard telling how he will act. 
0.642900	First off, I am generally an anxious person, so that doesn't help.  Mostly for me, it relates to the fact that I am going because something is generally wrong, or I am looking for medical advice.  When I either know or suspect that something is wrong, but I do not know what, it easily makes me anxious.  Combine that with the fact that I always have some sort of idea how the visit will go, but having the visit never go that way, I get easily anxious about the visit.
0.857100	One of the main reasons I don't have a primary care physician is because I never liked going to the doctor as a child. Having physicals scared me really bad and I'm probably traumatized. So I am in no hurry to go to the doctor for any reason. If I get sick I just wait it out. 
0.142900	My health is pretty good so there isnât anything that I am really concerned about. I guess just getting my yearly physical. I hate getting that every year.
0.476200	Just wondering how things are going to go. If there's something wrong with me. I don't want to come out with bad news but most of my visits are pretty good. I stay real healthy and workout a lot.
0.285700	It depends on the examination, but I am very self conscious of my body shape, and worry they will judge or laugh behind my back. 
0.857100	I don't want to be given things I am allergic to, and I want to feel better. Doctors don't always give me that feeling that I will feel better.
0.309500	I am also worried and anxious that something is going to be wrong with me.  I'm just afraid for the worst care scenario.
0.238100	The unknown answer of what might be the issue. Unless Army doctors- then its the worry of laziness causing further harm. 
0.809500	I always feel like I'm getting in trouble when I go to the doctor.  I see them as an authority figure and having to discuss any issue in detail causes me great anxiety.  I feel that they will blame me for whatever health issue is going on.  I don't feel they will be open to discussing other options or side effects of medications they prescribe.  I often feel dismissed if I want to try alternative natural options.  They treat me like I'm inferior and they know best.  I hate having to feel like I need to fight for my own health issues, instead of just do what is convenient for them.
0.214300	It's more just a general worry of could anything be wrong or irrational things like even though I'm on birth control is it possible I'm pregnant random things like that. Not so much an actual I am worried because of my doctor or any real possibility.
0.690500	Finding out what is actually wrong with me. And just having to tell them all my business. I'm not the most social person.
0.666700	I usually have to go to the doctor for sick visits.  In that frame of mind, I am already uncomfortable.  I am usually worried that I will have a long way to recovery, or I will need to take expensive medication.
0.881000	If ever I am at a doctor's office, it is normally because I am experienced an unexplained medical issue. I am always worried about what could be wrong. I am a worst case scenario type of person. I always assume the worst and come prepared to hear the worst, whether that is true or not. I also get worried that I will leave the office without many answers as to what is going on. I typically have great blood pressure, but as soon as they take it at the doctors office, it is always much higher due to my nerves!
0.619000	Just get anxious that they may find something wrong with me that will change my way of life. I also feel like there is a good likelihood of me getting sick from other sick people when i go to the doctor
0.666700	I always feel like the doctor is going to look at me weird or find something that is wrong that I wasn't aware of.  
1.000000	When visiting the doctor's office, I feel anxious or worried about not being given a choice about anything that may be wrong. I also feel anxious about being poked and prodded as well as being told I need a needle to make me feel better instead of treating a problem, the doctor treats the symptoms.
0.357100	"The thing that makes me most anxious is when I do not believe my concerns are being addressed. For instance, a doctor did not want to discuss my ankle problem during a ""well woman examination,"" and gave me a lecture about this. She said I'd need another appointment. I wanted to ask one or two quesions before I agreed to do that and she cut me off. The ankle pain was having a significant effect on my quality of life."
0.904800	"I guess I am most worried that something will be seriously wrong with me, because I don't have time to be sick. Also, I am overweight--not more than 15-20 pounds--but some doctors make nasty remarks about it. I had one male doctor ask me, "" How do you expect to find a lover when you're fat?""."
0.642900	There is an element of wanting to stay healthy and be on track.  Thoughts might go to the measures you've taken such as exercise and diet to stay healthy.  Have these been adequate or is more required, and will you now be able to accomplish what will be asked of you?
0.738100	Other sick people there, the wait times are long, whether the doctor has an accurate picture of my medical history.
0.714300	I am a generally anxious person and any interaction with a doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I am uncomfortable with my body and with the shape I am in so that plays into it as well. Mostly, I just feel like a freak and my problems are unusual or like the doctors are judging me and the shape that I am in. 
0.714300	I am afraid that a recurrence of a disease might occur. I am also allergic to many antibiotics, so any time that I have an infection, I am afraid that I will have a reaction if I am taking a new antibiotic. It is just a relief when the doctor tells me what the problem is and that it can be easily treated. 
0.261900	I do not feel anxious or worried.  I am prepared to accept anything that comes my way.  The only way I will be able to stop giving my murderis ex 65% of my only income, SS, is to die.
0.809500	I am most worried about the wait being too long. It would be great if they used a ticket system so we do not have to wait, crowded in an area where there might be germs left by sick people.
0.857100	I'm worried that they'll find something really wrong with me or that they'll say that I'm worse off than I think I am.  I'm also not a big fan of needles, and actively try to avoid getting stuck with one.
0.142900	Can't say as I'm usually worried when visiting the doctor's office.  So, nothing? I pretty much know why I'm there and what the ultimate result/plan is going to be.
0.190500	Sometimes I think I have the white coat syndrome, especially when it comes to my B/P.  I used to be on B/P medication and it was getting too low so my doctor took me off the medication.  Now my B/P is slowly creeping back up.  I do not want to go back on the medication so everytime I go to the doctor and have my B/P checked, I am anxious about what it will be.
0.714300	It is mainly the fear of not getting any answers to my questions.  This as well as having my body examined by a somewhat creepy doctor who seems interested in me.
0.142900	I am usually not worried...just the awkwardness of say, a pelvic exam, or being in one of those glamorous paper gowns. I am not anxious about my health since I am only there for routine checkups.
0.785700	I have anxiety disorder so it's mostly just that. any kind of appointment makes me anxious in general so that doesn't help. 
0.285700	I feel anxious about a potential upsetting diagnosis at times especially when a concern could be a symptom of a serious ailment like cancer
0.881000	I feel anxious about what the problem may be, what the treatment options would be, and any recovery time. I worry about my blood pressure, heart rate, and weight, even though I've never had problem with any of those three. The thing that makes me most nervous is trying to explain to the doctor my illness or pain. I always feel like I'm being judged and I can't explain myself well enough.
0.714300	I am always nervous around doctors because If I am at the doctor it is because something is wrong with my health that I have not been able to address by myself. That being said, I also am just nervous around unfamiliar people in general, and as a young and fairly healthy person, all doctors are unfamiliar. 
0.476200	I need to lose about 40 pounds, and I need to eat better.  I always have plans to do that but never get it done.  
0.714300	Sometimes not knowing what might happen. What if something is abnormal and It turns out to be something bad.
0.142900	I feel no worries or nerves when I walk into the office, because I know she will take good care of me. She has never let me down, and knows exactly how to cure me and knows what she needs to do in order to get me to feel better. 
0.333300	the unkown in general. until you talk to them or test comeback there is no actual knowing.   its just wait wait wait wait. 
0.476200	If it is not a routing check up and there is some physical problem that caused me to go there than I obviously would be concerned that the result might show something I would not be happy about.
0.666700	I think it's just generally anxiety of being in a situation that isn't common and also the worry that they may end up finding that something is wrong even though I feel fine.
0.476200	I'm always worried that the doctor will be disappointed that weight isn't where it should be. I worry about the blood test results. It's part of the unknown that worries me. 
0.452400	The thing that makes me the most anxious when visiting the doctors office is worrying that I won't be taken seriously and won't get the help I need.  I feel like that happens a lot.  Also, I don't like when I have to get undressed and put on one of those hospital gowns for an exam.  I don't think anyone does.  The worst part is when I have to get a pap smear.  The speculum and the actual procedure is pretty painful too.  Another thing that makes me nervous is fear that I'm going to look stupid when I don't understand something exactly.  Also, if the doctor orders tests, that can be no fun although I know it's necessary.
0.547600	I only feel anxious or worried, because I do not know what the outcome will be. I know the doctor will be a great help, but getting to the results is the anxious part. 
0.642900	Me personally, I have social anxiety disorder. So I feel uneasy just leaving my house. I feel like mine gives the most worst case scenario much of the time. I end up worrying a lot until they get the test results back. I have been told I might have cancer. False alert. I was told I have diabetes and had to stick my finger twice a day for a year. Just to have another doctor tell me I didn't have it. etc.
0.285700	When a doctor is condescending or makes you feel like you have done something wrong. It takes quite a bit to make me feel anxious and that will do it. I would only be worried about a specific diagnoses and I don't think that a doctor could control that.
0.833300	I'm not a big fan of being touched by people I don't know, even if it's by a medical professional looking for 'lumps' or what have you. I guess that makes me feel uneasy, but I also worry that one day I'll receive a negative medical diagnosis. 
0.333300	If I go in for something embarrassing and/or unpleasant. If I happen to have waited a little to long before I went to the Dr because I thought the problem would go away and didn't want to hear any bad news. 
0.904800	I always fear the worst, that something is really wrong with me. plus, I worry I'll be able to get all I need out of the appointment. 
0.642900	What makes me the most anxious and worried is that they do not do a thorough examination.  They move patients through like they are cattle and it's frustrating. People deserve a hundred percent of the  doctors attention for a complete physical that should really include blood work after a certain age. I'm worried that the doctors are working so quickly that they will miss something serious and by the time it's caught it will be too late and I'll end up dying from something that could have been fixed had it been caught in a timely manner. It scared me to think that could happen to me. 
0.452400	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong that I didn't notice.  Or that they will make negative comments about my life choices or lifestyle. 
0.738100	I just don't like the process and while I'm not a full blown hypochondriac, my mother was and I just worry about if something will be wrong with me, even though I don't spend most of my daily life worrying about random sicknesses.
1.000000	I am anxious that my health is already ruined. I think about death too much and I am anxious that I am going to die
0.571400	I am worried about what kind of conditions that the doctor might find that I don't know of. I am also worried about things like high blood sugar and type two diabetes. I wonder if the doctor is judging things about my body, like my weight. This is often something I think of, the doctor judging my weight... I feel like I even hold back from going to the doctor because of the feelings of being judged. 
0.666700	When you are my age 66 any DRs visit can be worrisome. Your body breaks down with age. You worry that you are suffering from some kind of health issue.
0.381000	I do not get anxious or worried about the actual examination or medical procedure itself, but more from a general misunderstanding of what is going on. I feel that I have no idea how much everything is going to cost and if I am even visiting the right doctor for the issue. If I am sick or have a medical issue, I don't know who to go to and do not understand how my health insurance policy works. 
0.238100	I would be most anxious and worried at a doctors visit if I was being tested for some form of cancer. I would worry that I would be confirmed for having a difficult or tough cancer to beat.
0.738100	I am worried frequently that they will again tell me nothing is wrong with me, despite a variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms that have persisted. I am also anxious that I will get overwhelmed and not be able to discuss my questions or accurately answer unexpected questions. 
0.142900	THE ONLY TIME I FEEL ANXIOUS OR NERVOUS WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTORS IS IF THEY THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG OR I AM SICK AND THINK I MIGHT BE NERVOUS OF THE OUTCOME.
0.238100	I still fear needles so I feel anxious when anything with needles is required. This includes vaccines and blood tests. Even the prick finger tests make me fear.
0.666700	When visiting my doctor for a routine check-up I'm generally calm and comfortable. I feel slightly anxious concerning lab results because that's what tells the true story. Visiting the doctor due to an illness causes the most anxiety because I know something is wrong. 
0.452400	That I am not going to receive the proper care and relief to my issues. That he is going to make a mistake due to laziness or make a wrong decision due to his comfort level
0.142900	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I only got bored if I need to wait too long.

0.452400	I feel worried that they will find something, mainly cancer, that I have not noticed going on with my body. I worry that they will tell me that I am not healthy for my age. I worry that they will tell me that I need to make changes in my lifestyle. 
0.523800	"I always wonder what my diagnosis will be; I am a worrier and always ""WebMD"" things and blow things out of proportion. I look forward to meeting with my doctor because she helps to put things into perspective for me."
0.547600	Just going to a doctors office makes me a little anxious. I have some anxiety issues so when doing something or going somewhere new I get nervous. I would also be a little worried that any issues I have would be passed off as just anxiety symptoms.
0.690500	I tend to feel rushed and looked over quickly. I am hesitant to tell my physician any issues I am having due to this. This makes me anxious as I feel I am not getting a thorough evaluation and something might be missed. This is a cause of worry for me.
0.547600	I'm overweight and very self-conscious/embarrassed by it.  I know I'm not taking the best card of myself and I just dread being told what I already know; it feels shameful.
0.666700	In general I get stressed when going to a doctor. There is no certain reason why I get that way but I do. I think it may go back to my childhood going to doctors worrying about getting shots, etc.
0.238100	I don't really stress much because I know my body.  I have a slight degree about the worry that something else might appear. but all in all I trust my doctor.
0.714300	I am a bit (at least) out of shape and I have concerns that visiting will cause me to work on too many things that I know I should.  Lame, I know but I can live with it alright for now.
0.714300	"A general health care facility doesn't always understand that some people are intelligent and they don't like when a patient says ""I don't want that"". "
0.476200	I am afraid that something may be wrong.  Or if something is already wrong, that it may not be easily resolved. 
0.190500	If that when I do go in for something minor he has to have a sit down with me in order to mention something serious.
0.642900	I always feel anxious or worried when visiting, just because if there is bad news to be given, that is where it is going to come from.  I am not the healthiest person ever, and I know that one day that could all backfire on me.
0.666700	I am a cancer patient. I am approaching my 60th birthday, and I am beginning to experience health concerns that are related to my age. It causes me anxiety to learn about changing health parameters, such as blood pressure, that are more difficult for me to cope with due to my increasing age.
0.404800	The uncertainty is what makes me the most worried.  I am actually eager to get back the results as soon as possible so I could see what the issue is but waiting for it is what worries me the most.
0.523800	I feel anxious and worried when i feel like my doctor may give me some terrible news about my health
0.142900	I sometimes feel anxious prior to arriving to the doctors office because of the unknown result. I believe that my condition can change from time to time and this causes a little worry. I trust my doctor's knowledge of medicine, his ability to diagnose conditions, and treated appropriately.
0.595200	Visiting the doctors office will always make me anxious due to the reason of the visit, or the idea that maybe the results of an analysis of blood work or urine sample is positive. Also getting an injection or the idea of getting an operation is frightening to me. The feeling is competently normal. Even if you are just doing a routine check up . The doctor can have a lot of patients to see before you ,and the idea of waiting in line for 30 min can make me anxious. You always assume the worst even if you have a mild cold or headache. With the flu season you always feel like you are the next person to have gotten it . Or when you get a mild rash from eating something with  citrus in it. Other than that I'm very happy after seeing my physician . It is calming  to know that everything is ok.
0.142900	"Not much.  I don't like giving blood samples, so that would be the biggest ""fear"" or cause for anxiety.  The other one is the prostate exam."
0.714300	That not only will something be wrong but something that I didn't even predict would be wrong as well.
0.523800	the possibility of the doctor discovering something i was unaware. while it's good they are able to identify anything which needs to be addressed, i'm obviously hoping that i leave the doctor with a clean bill of health. i'm always worried that this will not be the case. 
0.309500	Just that they might find something wrong with me.  Like a mole that is too big or some lump I did not notice.  Nothing major just the general anxiety that comes with going to the doctor.  You never know when something that you think is small or did not even notice could turn into something big.  You hear about it all of the time.
0.381000	Most of the time I worried that I might forget stuff that I need to tell him in order to help me with my condition.
0.976200	the not knowing what to expect and the knowing i usually get no answers and rarely ever do i ever feel better no matter how many  times i go and then i just have to get used to living with whatever the problem may be
0.142900	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor because I know everything will be okay with my doctors care.
0.595200	I'm most worried about the germs at the doctor's office and catching something from others. I don't want to get sick, even if I already am. 
0.690500	The anxiety I believe comes from the uncertainty of what I might be told. Although I could leave the office with a clean bill of health there is always the chance you could find out you have a serious medical issue.
0.357100	Probably the possibility of outcomes. I'm always nervous that the problems I'm there for will be something more serious. 
0.547600	I'm overweight, I don't like getting on the scales nor hearing about it. Otherwise not much else bothers me.
0.666700	Most of my anxiety is the result of concerns about what my diagnosis might be and whether or not my treatment is effective. One of the chronic illnesses I have can have serious, life-threatening consequences if not treated properly as can the medications I take for it. I am not anxious about the actual physical process of being examined, with the exception of paps smears and mammograms as these are sometimes a painful process. I normally choose female physicians for all of my medical procedures and this the direct result of years of interacting with male doctors, many of who did not seem to understand my efforts to communicate symptoms. It may be me or it may have been them, but the end result is that I am much less anxious in any medical situation when I am attended to by a female doctor.
0.333300	I feel most anxious about how the interaction with the doctor will go, how I will be treated as a patient, and whether we can exchange the right amount of information to make informed decisions. 
0.666700	I don't like going to Dr's offices.  I think of sick people and death when I go there.  I lost a child at 19 weeks of pregnancy which makes me even more anxious when I am in a Dr's office.
0.547600	Sometimes you just do not know what they will find. I worry that they may tell me something is wrong that I had no idea existed, so I am always a little nervous. 
0.500000	I feel anxious going in for blood work, and while waiting for the test results for cholesterol or diabetes.  I fear the lifestyle changes that may result from bad results.
0.738100	The most obvious answer for me would be either finding a potentially new problem or having an existing but controllable problem change or get worse.
0.928600	The uncertainty of what's causing my problem makes me anxious or worried.  I have to be really sick and can not find any resolution on my own to go to a doctor.  I will have exhausted all possible natural solutions first before I consult a doctor.  I am anxious of what they will say is wrong and if they will judge me for my actions or inaction.  I worry that something is seriously wrong.  
0.738100	I am always worried and concerned that something serious has developed since my last appointment. Itâs a fear based on nothing in particular 
1.000000	I hate it when they arrive late. I'm left sitting in a filthy room, waiting for them to come in and put their cold hands on me. Once she arrives, she is busy logging on to her computer and trying to convince me that I need to go on some blood pressure medication when I've never had high blood pressure in my life. It shoots straight up when I visit the hospital in anticipation of ill treatment. 
0.547600	Only when it may result in permanent bad news. I try to stay in good shape and would be nervous to receive unexpected bad news. 
0.214300	If it is not a routine office visit, I would be anxious/worried about what the test results are or what further testing is needed.  Maybe I need to have further tests to find out if anything is wrong, that makes me worried/anxious.
0.642900	I have aches and pains, and I really don't want to stop for surgery right now.  This would be my knees.  I sometimes feel afraid of worse diagnoses.  Plus my doctor doesn't hear me when I say the diabetes test is wrong.  I am diabetic and the numbers don't get good just like that.  Whatev.
0.428600	Finding out that something may be wrong. Having a couple of scary medical situations, of course, I'd feel uneasy. 
0.857100	I really only go to the doctor when I am sick.  I am overweight and I smoke.  I dread the lectures from the doctor. I know I should lose weight and I know smoking is bad for me.  The only reason I am there is to get help with whatever issue I have.
0.881000	I get very nervous when I have to visit the doctor because I have huge phobia of needles, so I am always worried they will have to run a blood test or give me a tetanus shot or have some reason or another to poke me. I am also always slightly worried they will find something horribly wrong with me like cancer or some incurable disease that only gives me a few months to live. That is always in the back of my mind, that I may be dying or have to get a shot, those are about the only things that worry me about going to the doctor.
0.333300	I feel the most anxious when I have a test and I am waiting for the results. I also feel anxious when I am in a lot of pain and I do not know why. 
0.595200	Cancer runs in my family. So I am worried that the doctor will find a lump or a growth somewhere on my body when I get a physical(even though I am in near-perfect health)
0.309500	If I am having a procedure that is uncomfortable (such as a pap) I am generally a little bit anxious as it is uncomfortable.  Also, as a cancer survivor I get nervous that I may have a test that sparks cancer screening
0.785700	Typically a doctor visit means that something is wrong with my health. Often the results are benign but there's always a chance that the result comes back with a major illness or other issue.
0.523800	What might be found out, what could be wrong with me.  Especially when going in with a new medical problem, something I haven't really experienced before.
0.714300	I fear I won't be taken seriously, or that I will again be carelessly diagnosed or prescribed another harmful medication.
0.690500	I worry that something may be wrong with me that I don't know about. I worry the doctor will scold me for genuinely bad habits I have, like drinking and smoking, and how that might show in whatever results he is looking at. 
0.571400	I am most anxious that they will find something that is incurable and will end my life as I know it prematurally.
0.976200	I have felt anxious at a DR's appointment when they found something wrong with my health. This usually leads to fear and overthinking a condition or trying to guess the treatment plan.
0.500000	I always feel like this I'm about to get a cancer diagnosis or something. Or they're going to tell me I tested positive for the next black plague. 
0.547600	I'm now at the age where there is a possibility of receiving terrible news.  It ins't likely but still possible.
0.500000	If my pain or illness is something that is unsure of it worries me because I think it may be some serious thing that I have never encountered before
0.500000	I worry that my doctor is going to miss something serious because he is just going through the motions of another physical or exam instead of being meticulous and caring.
0.500000	The initial first visit for an issue I am having bothers me most. Without any knowledge from them yet I get very anxious. When they tell me the diagnosis I get worried. 
0.714300	"I don't like the possibility of being diagnosed with something bad. I also feel like I will have to do my ""homework"" such as individual research and seeking second opinions before agreeing with what my doctor says."
0.904800	I hate the anual exams, well woman check-ups. They make me anxious and uneasy. I do dread them. I don't know why, I just do. I also hate mamograms. They make me anxious too. They hurt.
0.595200	I get worried about talking about things that make me nervous. My private body parts are private to me and even the doctor makes me feel uncomfortable. I work to try to speak about these things but just never gets easier. Also worried about hearing I have sickness or disease thats not curable. Things get rougher and rougher with age and when I get older feel like somethings just bound to go wrong with my health. 
0.523800	I am worried about getting bad news, I worry that I might have something terminal. I have medical anxiety so I avoid the doctor a lot.
0.357100	I used to get anxious and worried, but not anymore. My doctor has given me the trust and the confidence that everything is alright and that everything is going to be fine.
0.714300	If I feel I have a serious illness.  I would obviously be afraid because I'm afraid of getting sick.  I like being healthy and being in tip-top shape to do the things I love to do in life.
0.714300	I always get nervous when it comes to my weight because I've had a weight problem for a long time and it has in no way gotten better.
0.881000	I worry they may call me a liar. I worry they may not trust what I say about what is bothering me. I worry they may tell other people I'm a liar. I worry they may put false things in my medical chart.
0.285700	Concern about what they might find that is wrong with me, and concern that the doctor may not be able to do anything about what is wrong.
0.690500	I do not know what he will do or say. I also fear something being very serious and needing to have to go to the hospital. I am not a fan of hospitals. I have had one surgery, and that is enough for me. I do not want any more. Think about it: One guy knocks you out while another cuts into you with a knife. Not something to make you feel good about.
0.476200	Any feeling of anxiety when visiting a doctor is usually because I would be feeling particularly unwell or unsure about something, and as result am expecting there to be a real problem. 
0.619000	The unknown to me is definitely the worst part. I often think of the worst thing that could happen and it's hard to think of anything else afterwords. Sitting in the waiting room also makes me feel anxious because I keep thinking about anything bad that could occur.  Finally, when the doctor starts talking too fast or talks about confusing things i get nervous that I will not understand something.
0.428600	I usually know what I am there for, or I have an idea of what my issue could be. I am able to put my trust in the doctor seeing me and I feel confident they will diagnose me with the correct issue. I'm sometimes anxious about what will happen, since I don't know ahead of time. Mostly I just want answers and relief, so I'm more than willing to let them do their job and help me.
0.690500	I feel worried that something might be wrong with me and don't want to find out the bad news. I also don't like showing my body to my doctor. It can be very awkward.
0.666700	There's not really anything specific that makes me anxious. I think I just dislike getting examined by people in general. 
0.571400	I guess the only thing that truly makes me feel anxious or worried is just stupid bs that's in my head. I feel ashamed of myself for a variety of reasons, especially when it comes to finances and lack of being able to afford insurance. My doctor has never given me a reason to feel these things though, and has actually helped aleve some of these worries and concerns.
0.666700	I feel anxious or worried when I have to remove my clothes. Also, when I am concerned that my problem may be serious.
0.857100	I am not a doctor so I don't have the knowledge or equipment to test and find factual results and when you do your own research or diagnosis it usually looks more bad than good and you don't know what's going on for sure.
0.142900	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office when I know my health is not good.  I feel the knowledge that I have about health nutrition can be worrisome when I find myself at a doctorâs office.  I do sometimes get anxious because I was either unaware of my mental condition or physical condition during my visits.  I felt that my physical health was in good standing, but then I take a visit to the doctorâs office, and I am told that I still need to fix my high blood pressure and cholesterol.  Not all visits are worrisome, its just keeping on track with what my doctorâs tells me to do until the next visit.    
0.404800	"going to see a doctor is never pleasant but i rarely experience any severe anxiety.  i certainly don't experience dread.  i think one reason for this is i'm about to turn 62.  i realize that although i'm not VERY old, most of my years are in the past and i know it's inevitable that my health, at some point, will take a negative turn and perhaps a drastic one.  i can deal with that because, as the old saying goes, ""none of us get out of here alive.""  i think i can deal with whatever i learn at any medical appointment.  the only time i'd be real anxious is if i knew i was facing a painful procedure."
0.428600	I am most worried that they are not going to listen to what I am describing as my actual problem. And only listen to key words that I might say. 
0.976200	I'm worried that he is going to give me a difficult diagnosis and if I don't have someone there with me? Like a close friend or family member? I'm not sure how I would handle the situation because No one likes to be alone when bad news is delivered.
0.547600	From time to time I am guilty of thinking along the line of assuming the worst rather than keeping it simple. In those types of thinking cycles it is easy to get worked up about some tests because I can imagine the results will come back telling me I have some horrible disease or worse. The reality is usually less traumatic.
0.619000	When I visit the doctor, I don't know how long I'll end up waiting. Sometimes, I'm worried about what I might find out. I really just don't get a lot of enjoyment from visiting the doctor.
0.761900	What makes me feel most anxious is being misdiagnose with a terminal disease like cancer or HIV when i never really had it. I'm scared to get vaccinations when i'm healthy because i feel it will only make me susceptible to those diseases. I believe the only thing that gets sick is your mind and if i begin to feel helpless due to a misdiagnosis, my immune system will get weaker and the virus will be easier to take over my body & emotions.
0.190500	The situation that makes me feel most uneasy is if my concerns will be brushed off and that I will be treated like I'm overreacting and that I don't know anything. 
0.523800	The biggest concern is that a serious, non-treatable issue will be uncovered.Going hand in hand with that is that treatment for an uncovered medical issue might not be affordable.
0.309500	I have white coat syndrome. No matter how many doctors appointments I have I always get nervous! Even if it's a normal check up! My blood pressure rises, and I typically have low blood pressure. But not at the doctor's office! And I know this so then I get nervous about my blood pressure going up, which of course makes it go up more. 
0.285700	Mostly, it is the fear of the unknown. I have high blood sugar, and I am always concerned that my doctor might tell me that I am a diabetic. That would be very traumatic for me. This relates to my weight, and I worry what my doctor's scale will show for that.
0.452400	I have brain tumors. They've been controlled and benign for a few years now. I'm always fearful they will come alive again or others will develop. I get MRIs a couple times a year, and I'm always anxious waiting to hear the results of those.
0.690500	it's inconvenient to take time out of a work day to be at a doctor's office.  i don't like the feeling that i may or may not get a solution to the problem i came in with.  i don't like not knowing what's wrong with me, and not knowing if the doctor i'm about to see will be able to help or not.  
0.761900	I just have a general fear or phobia of doctors and always have had this. I don't like being there and never will
0.142900	i never felt anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office. Its always good to have occasional visit to the primary care physician for preventive care 
0.809500	I think about how much everything is going to cost.  If you have a sore throat they can somehow make that into about $300 in cost.  The appointment?  $160.  The strep test, another $100.  Like, what the hell man!
0.785700	I rarely go into the office unless I have noticed something is very wrong with me. I generally tend to let things get to a bad point before reaching out for professional medical help.
0.285700	The only time I'm worried if there is something wrong that I haven't had looked at yet or if I'm waiting for results.
0.595200	Since I'm getting older I start to worry that something will be wrong with my heart, or the doctor will say I have to drastically change my diet and all the good foods like cheeseburgers and milkshakes will have to be eliminated. It's mainly just my aging that makes me nervous that this will be the visit where something has gone wrong that I never even noticed.
0.357100	I just get nervous that something could be wrong with me that I am unaware of.  Also getting tests done makes me nervous of the outcome
0.714300	I worry that the doctor will find something that is wrong and needs to be treated but the cost of medical care is so expensive that I will not be able to afford treatment.
0.404800	I mostly worry about the doc finding something that I never knew about.  Maybe in blood work or a physical exam.  I think that not knowing is the most of my worry.  once the exam or prognosis is complete I rest easy.  i don;t like needles so drawing blood is usually a stressful experience as well.
0.547600	Even if I'm perfectly healthy for some reason I get a little anxious because you can never know what will really happen. There are people younger than me that have died from cancer and horrible things, so it's always in the back of my mind.
0.190500	"I am usually not anxious or worried. I suppose I would be if I was expecting a test result that could possibly be ""bad news."""
0.666700	I've always been an anxious person, I tend to think it's because my mother died when I was young. Going to the doctor for anything serious, or a new pain or issue is very nerve wracking for me. It makes me worry about death and what would happen to my kids if god forbid something happened to me.
0.857100	I was struggling with a condition that i did research on and found out that the symptoms matched a disease i feared greatly so when i went to my doctor and told him of my symtoms he scheduled some tests and an exam, during the exam i had all if these feelings because i feared receiving the news that i was right.
0.523800	I always think there is going to be something wrong with me, or it will be even more negative I get worried cause all of my health issues.
0.523800	I dont know if I will have good news at the end or bad news. It makes me nervous to go through something like it.I dont like the uncertainty of what the outcome might me
0.857100	I don't like the feeling of not knowing what they are going to do to me. I hate blood and I hate needles. I like to know what to expect when I go places.
0.238100	I am most anxious when I see a needle for a shot because I have a strong physical reaction to them and feel uncomfortable, but I know it will pass
0.904800	I worry about what the outcome may be.  If something is seriously wrong with me.  (like getting cancer for instance)
0.285700	I am always worried that I may get bad news in any dr office. I am nervous I may get bad news and I may get. 
0.714300	Sometimes I feel like I'm going to learn news that I cannot unhear. That I will hear that I am finally dying and that I cannot do anything more to prevent the ill fate that has been thrust upon me.
0.785700	I feel most anxious and worried in a doctor's office because I am uncomfortable in a setting where I feel vulnerable and alone. I don't like one on one settings with someone I barely know. I don't want to be uncomfortable talking about something I don't want other people to know about, or the doctor having to examine me naked.
0.857100	Well, having been misdiagnosed and, on other occasions, groped by doctors in an inappropriate sexual way (especially by 2 ob/gyn practitioners) has resulted in my being anxious and worried whenever I visit. One misdiagnosis nearly cost me my life--thank goodness I was able to figure out what was wrong--I then marched back to the doctor's office and demanded the right course of treatment. I have also been subject to Dr. Perverts--as in two ob/gyns who sought fit to check my breasts for cysts by groping them for long periods of times. One ob/gyn even closed his eyes and smiled as he squeezed my breasts and told me afterwards how beautiful my breasts were. Suffice to say, I feel anxious, worried and very much on guard when visit the doctor's office. 
0.642900	I am naturally an anxious person and I worry a lot, even when there is nothing to worry about my mind just starts going and I start worrying about a lot.  So just going in to the doctor's office makes me anxious.  I will worry something horrible is wrong with me.  I am not anxious about seeing the doctor as my doctor is great.  Its just everything that goes along with it.  Mostly just the thoughts in my head.
0.381000	bad news about my health and the cost of treatments. sometimes visiting doctor and the lab exams he ask me to take may turn up to be costly
0.428600	The discovery of a new ailment that would lead to new treatments and medicines with uncertain outcome.  You always want to be healthy, but sometimes as you age you are not sure whether something may pop up unexpected.  Also, as you age the number of tests and labs seem to increase. This leads to a time of worry and anxiety to get the results back.  Hopefully, the doctor can put your mind at ease if relevant that the tests are just a precaution. So you do not have to worry while waiting.  Otherwise, you can just try to lead the healthiest life possible and go in to the office confident that you are ok.
0.523800	Getting bad, difficult or negative health news, is what makes me most anxious about visiting the Doctor's.
0.976200	When visiting the doctor's office I am always filled with anxiety and dread due to the environment always giving me that feeling since childhood. It probably roots back to a fear of needles and too much media, but it still affects me to this day. Today, it would instead be a fear of being diagnosed with some incurable disease or being told that I can no longer do the things I enjoy in life due to some pain or injuries. Outside of that, a routine doctor's visit is normally only filled with worry on the drive there. I usually leave feeling more ensured and happier than when I came in.
0.285700	My doctor's office has always been very kind and welcoming. The only things that can make me feel anxious at my doctors office are the financial and insurance aspects of my visit. Even then the people there are always understanding and willing to try and accommodate my every need.

0.428600	I don't generally feel anxious when visiting the doctor because I'd rather find out whether or not something is wrong with me than remain in the dark. If I have to go in to have a procedure of some sort, however, then I do feel nervous just because of the uncertainty of the outcome.

0.500000	I AM ALWAYS WORRIED THAT I WILL HAVE A FATILE DIAGNOSIS IF I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY OWN BODY.
0.142900	I very rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctors office. My doctor puts me at ease with any issues or concerns that may come up. The only times I have ever felt anxious or worried, were after having testing done, that could come back with negative results and indicate I have health issues. 
0.904800	I'm not a particular fan of people getting in my personal space and touching me. I know they need to at some points during exams but I am most definitely not a fan. 
0.619000	I have a general anxiety towards all doctors and healthcare providers. My doctor I trust very well but I still feel somewhat anxious when seeing any kind of healthcare provider. This is something that I just have to deal with when seeing a doctor.
0.714300	If I'm going there about something that I've noticed as a problem, I fear that it is some bigger problem that could be painful/long treatment to fix if it is even fixable.  I also know there are some issues in my family that could someday present themselves in me and I really don't want to have those problems.

0.928600	I don't like to be undressed in a doctor's office. I don't like to show my body to anyone but my husband. I hate getting tests done and i don't know the results of the test
0.285700	The thing(s) that make me most anxious while visiting the doctors office is the unknown. Sometimes when I am sick and do not understand why, the waiting to find out causes more anxiety than what it is worth.
0.690500	Most things make me anxious, so it is not necessarily a special occasion. I do not do well with uncertainty, so if it something beyond a checkup or the like, enter: anxiety.
0.357100	Don't really like someone proding or poking me or asking personal questions. I also don't like the idea of something going on that I may not be aware of that could have major complications on my life and my family. 
0.666700	Basically, I have a constant fear that Iâm dying. Cancer, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, brain tumors,
0.547600	I hate waiting. They ask all these questions and when you're healthy it just seems like a waste of time. I could have filled out a form and gotten the same answer: You are well.
0.285700	I'm worried that I won't present my case or issues well, and that I'll be brushed aside. My doctor doesn't have intimate knowledge of my history, and I'm worried I'll somehow leave out information that would help them identify my problems.
0.642900	It makes me most fearful that something will be seriously wrong . Or that something might be painful. But the unknown is worse.
0.142900	I don't feel dread with most doctors. I dread getting any sort of OB-GYN exam for obvious reasons.  (It's weird, intrusive, and unpleasant.)  With new doctors, I worry about being dismissed as not knowing my own body or not being taken seriously.  
0.571400	I am always anxious or nervous that something is wrong with me, or that they will find something that is abnormal.  I also just get uneasy in hospitals/doctor's offices in general.
0.785700	I feel very anxious when I am sick because I don't like not being in control. I don't know that the doctors make me feel any more anxious but they don't necessarily alleviate that anxiety.
0.547600	I usually not too anxious going to the doctor but there is some there.  You always here the horror stories of healthy people going in for a routine checkup and walking out with a serious disorder.  That is scary.  
0.142900	Well honestly I rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor.  The only time I can see myself being worried about my condition is when I have something that might be seriously wrong with me and it is more of a reaction to the condition than to the doctors visit itself.  I tend to be a pretty calm individual in most situations so it rarely ever comes up.  Though what exactly makes me worried more than anything is simply the possibility of a condition that can only be treated and not cured but I think that is something that bothers most people in general.
0.428600	I am the kind of person who always gets nervous in a doctors office. I just get nervous about the fact that they could find something wrong. Typically, I calm down once I start talking but I am still a bit on edge until I leave even if I have a great visit. I think it is just a natural fear inside of me. 
0.785700	That the doctor is just going to say anything. That doctors dont care to actually really examine a patient. They just have a goal to prescribe a prescription for anything and any reason.
0.642900	i am anxious or worried about what might be the diagnosis , scared of any new illnesses or anything that will make me have to come back for any sort of treatment
0.261900	Worried that the diagnosis will be negative and effect my life. If it involves a procedure I get worried about the pain and not being able to control it when I leave the doctors office. 
0.785700	First and foremost, I hate going to the doctor office simply because I do not want to be around other sick people.  I'm afraid that I might pick up some sickness from someone else and then end up feeling actually worse than I already was feeling.  Also, I hate just sitting in the doctor office because it seems like they are so slow about calling you back to actually see the doctor.
0.381000	I am always anxioius or nervous because you never know what they will find. I am also nervous about the cost and what my insurance will cover.
0.904800	I am the most anxious that the paper gowns will not fit me. As crazy as it seems I do not want to sit on a paper table in a paper gown. I hate that part. I would rather sit in a cloth gown! They never close and then the paper blanket is usually a joke as well. It is frustrating. I also hate giving blood and that process of waiting to be called to do that. I often say I would run away if I could then we laugh. I mean it though. I know it is necessary but those two things: gowns and blood are my issues.
0.285700	I'm a cancer survivor, so I always worry that something seriously wrong will be found. Certain exams are more uncomfortable than others. Sometimes, I feel anxious about possible pain.
0.881000	I have social anxiety, so just getting to the doctor and actually going are tough for me. I feel so much anxiety when I need to visit my doctor, 
0.761900	I have social anxiety and any time I have to go to an office and talk about personal things it's very difficult for me.
0.166700	I fear that something will be wrong with me, that I will be sick and I won't know it, and when they find out it will be too late.  But that is just a general feeling and doesn't really have too much to do with doctor visits, per se.
0.142900	I worry a little bit that a disease might be found...my dad had cancer for instance, I want to avoid that.
0.238100	I am hoping to get the most out of my visit. I want to be able to be comfortable with my doctor for future purposes.
0.285700	I don't generally feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I trust the physician and I don't have any serious ailments so I don't really have reason to worry.  At worst, sometimes I forget to bring my insurance card or have to do paperwork. The paperwork is always the worst part.
0.285700	I get anxious when I don't know the doctor and do not have a rapport or have had a bad personal experience with the doctor. 
0.619000	My history is long, and results from an accident many years back. The accident was serious and my injuries very severe. I continually deal with residual complications from that accident and also tend to develop new conditions as time goes on and I get older. Its almost impossible for me at this point to not have anxiety after my checkups.
0.642900	Finding out the worst case scenario, even though it is usually very simple treatment. For example going in for a cough and being diagnosed with cancer.
0.690500	I am most anxious if they grab my nuts. I hate when they have to examine everywhere it's just uncomfortable and they need a new procedure. That is just wierd.
0.738100	I just do not know if they will find out that something is wrong with me. I usually feel healthy but there is always a little uncertainty that something might be wrong without me knowing. 
0.642900	I'm not sure.  Even though my doctor is one of the best ones I have been to, I still get nervous at the visits.
0.142900	Nothing at all.  I feel completely calm and collected when I visit his office.  The only issue I ever have is somebody bringing a loud obnoxious child to the office with them but that doesn't really have anything to do with the office itself.
0.142900	That the doctor may be over looking something or not considering all the available treatments available for my condition.
0.523800	What makes me anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office is them finding something that is seriously wrong with me. In some degree, everyone fears dying and living a lifestyle where they virtually have none. I do not go to see a doctor very often at all and when I do, It's usually for something pretty serious. Therefore I worry a bit because I obviously do not completely know how the outcome may be.
0.785700	I feel uncomfortable in general in a doctor's office. I feel worried about being touched by someone who is generally a stranger.
0.404800	I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN MY DOCTOR SO I'M USUALLY NOT ANXIOUS OR WORRIED. IT MAY COME TO THAT SOME DAY BUT SO FAR IT HASN'T. EVEN NOW WITH MY LAST CT SCAN IT SHOWS A SPOT ON MY LUNG HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I'M NOT TO WORRIED ABOUT IT YET. MAYBE IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE.
0.738100	Test results are usually the because factor because I feel like the doctors sometimes focus on the test result and no other factors. I feel like I shouldn't be the only one fighting for my health. 
0.547600	Potentially having something life threatening wrong with me. My doctor missing something important. Having to take medicines with terrible side effects.
1.000000	What makes me feel most worried anxious is when my doctor is rushing me to see another pather...this is when he overbooks.
0.690500	I'm worried that a doctor will order a test that will result in negative results (negative meaning detrimental to my health). Sometimes it's easier not knowing that something is wrong than confirming that there is a problem.
0.690500	I feel most anxious about medical exams because I've experienced many life threatening medical issues that have required emergency surgery. I am fearful of death, and also of pain, and having to spend months of recovery. Also the loss of income, and the ability to provide for my family. 
0.595200	I have a medical condition that can get worse over time.  It could require surgery and this makes me anxious about doctor's visits.  I don't delay making an appointment likely because of my good relationship with the doctor.
0.738100	I am not good with needles, and I have had a bad experience in the past when they pricked my finger. I almost passed out, so they had to take me back into a room. I ended up having a blood blister and bruising on my finger for the next few days. 
0.142900	I have never felt anxious or worried when I go to see my doctor. The only way I would be if he found something wrong. He has never made me feel anything but trust and loyalty. I am very pleased with this man
0.142900	I think that it would be the part about receiving the worst information about your health. I think that interacting with your doctor should not make a patient anxious or worried, what worries me is receiving bad news from the doctor. Waiting for those test results is also very worrisome. 
0.142900	I worry that I will get sick from other people there.  I worry that I will hold the doctors back with my long appointments. I worry that my insurance will not cover something.
0.571400	I am afraid that he will find something really wrong with me like cancer or something.  Iâve never had anything like that and am in good health but am always afraid when I go to the doctor just for a checkup they will find something like that.
0.381000	That I will hear bad news, or that I will be told something that will frighten me. I would not like to hear something negative regarding my health if I do not need to. I also dislike hearing possible diagnoses, when there is no reason to be worried about them. 
0.500000	I'm not really sure what makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office.  Maybe it's the feeling of not being 'perfect' - not eating well enough, not having the perfect weight, not having the perfect blood pressure, etc. - and it seems that the doctor is always finding fault with something.
0.595200	I feel anxious or worried that my doctor will find something else wrong with me. I'd rather not hear it or know about it, to be honest
0.761900	I am anxious that there is something wrong with me that I am unaware of. I am anxious that I have some condition that is uncurable or chronic or otherwise scary.
1.000000	I have had so many of them refuse to treat me I am scared every time I walk in. I have had to travel around states and the country finding care. I am fully aware I may not get treated and not to take it personally. I am tired of being called crazy or a liar when I am really sick and NOT feeling well.
0.452400	Sometimes I feel anxious that what I think is some pretty minor thing will end up being something major.  Or that I will be one of the cases that end up in the news of doctors doing something totally wrong for the patient (amputating the wrong leg, etc.).  I also don't care for shots...
0.476200	The thing that worries me is not so much what he is telling me as a patient, but what he is not telling me for some reason outside of my best interest. I am definitely worried that he may not be as thourough as he should be, or that his recommendationas could have a negative impact.
0.452400	It makes me nervous. I hate weighing in. I do not like that sick people germs in the office. I don't like having to take my clothes off and get in that paper gown. It usually ends up ripping and that's always uncomfortable when that happens. Noone likes to wait to hear if there's bad news. It's always uncomfortable even when I like my doctor. It could be a head game for all I know?
0.714300	My blood pressure results, first off. It always runs really high. And I hate to see my weight because I really need to lose about 15-20 pounds. Also, they always ask me about smoking and drinking, of course, and I am a little embarrassed by how much I do of both because I know that should be less.
0.142900	That I will only bring important things to discuss with him.  That I listen to what he says and follow his orders.
0.190500	I feel anxious when i think something major is wrong. This is what makes me very worried and stressed out and I hate that feeling. I hate knowing that a test is pending as it bothers me a bit. It really gets to me overall.
0.309500	I am afraid that they WON'T listen to me or treat me like an individual and a real person and will rush through and only give me about 8 minutes of their time and not even ask if I have any questions.
0.595200	I am very anxious when I am waiting to see the doctor because I am always afraid that my insurance coverage won't be valid and that I will have to pay my medical bill out of my pocket. I get anxious with the thought of getting a disease or infection while sitting in the doctors office.
0.595200	I am anxious about my condition, whether it is improved or worsened. Because I am really trying to take care of myself with respect to this condition, I am really worried if it is not working in the good direction.
0.761900	I get nervous when visiting the doctor. Its been like that for a long time but my GP tries to make my visit as comfortable as possible
0.381000	finding out that something is more serious than I anticipated. getting sick from others at the doctors office makes me a little anxious as well
0.238100	There's always some amount of concern and anxiety associated with getting test results, because you never know what they might show. 
0.381000	I don't get anxious too often with doctors, they are there to help. The only part that makes me anxious is not knowing what the problem is and how costly the fix will be. More often than not it's expensive or time consuming.
0.547600	I am always anxious that there will be bad result or bad news.  I also am a little uncertain that the doctor is taking my actual thoughts or words into consideration. I know that he actually went to medical school but I live with me and know how I feel and what I am experiencing and to have a doctor disregard and dismiss my thoughts is upsetting.  I also do not like going to doctors I do not know who fill in because of bad experiences with rude doctors.
0.500000	"I'm just generally nervous when talking to people I'm not really familiar with, so going through the whole chain of interactions from front desk to nurse to doctor is a little bit stressful for me. But not the ""I'm afraid"" sort of stress. It's more of a ""where do I put my hands? Why did I say that? "" sort of stress."
0.285700	When visiting a new doctor's office for the first time I often feel worried they won't be able to help me fully or prescribe a medication that works for my body.
0.142900	There is very little that makes me anxious.  Doctors dont make me anxious at all.  I just don't enjoy hearing possible bad news.
0.285700	That i might not get what i want done. That iâll pay a lot of money for no benefits.  I do not have anxiety about visits.
0.619000	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing if there is anything wrong with me when it seems like there is not. It is also just the unknown and maybe the doctor having to bear that bad news to tell me. There is also me having to worry what the doctor will think too. 
1.000000	I have a major fear of doctors and my health in general. I am always afraid that  I will be diagnosed with something or made to have a procedure that will cause me pain. It terrifies me that we put so much trust in doctors and that what they say could change the course of my life. I am probably overreacting though.
0.714300	I'm anxious about being around people in general, and going to the doctor is not too much better. I am in good health thankfully, so I usually only go in for minor stuff.
0.142900	I have only felt anxious around a new doctor once or twice. This anxiety would likely be multiplied if the care provider were significantly younger than myself. Otherwise, I don't have issues with anxiety surrounding doctors appointments.  
0.500000	That I might get a bad diagnos8s I fear that something might be really wrong with me I also don't like needles so I am scared I might need to take a shot
0.642900	I am often anxious that I will be judged if I speak the truth about my health care needs and concerns. I am concerned that I am sent to different doctors who ultimately don't have answers for what is going on with me. I am worried my doctor will continue to push me to take meds that I suffer side effects from. I worry that I will fail to convince my doctor that I am really having problems.
0.642900	I'm always afraid that I will catch something there. I also, feel anxious that I will have a bad test result. I worry they will find something seriously wrong with me. 
0.619000	I just don't know what problems may pop up. I usually am healthy but recently I've been feeling a lot of different stuff. 
0.285700	It depends on the reason for the visit. If it is for a minor ailment, there is no reason to be anxious. I have no reason to feel anxious about a visit unless I the doctor gives me reason to be. i.e. bad health news
0.595200	I feel most anxious at the doctor when  I have an unexpected pain that I need looked at. I get anxious because I never know what the outcome will be. I have a huge fear of cancer, not a fear of dying from it but a fear of having to fight it.
0.833300	I think what makes me feel the most anxious and worried is that I might have a serious condition or disease. Sometimes being examined feels a bit uncomfortable as well.
0.357100	I'm always just a little worried something really bad will come up in the visit. I try to be completely honest about my physical condition, but I fear the doctor might discover something really serious about my health. I'm in a career field where my physical health (and lack of prescription medications) is extremely important, so I wouldn't want anything to come up that would affect my work.
0.523800	Because I worry about that something is wrong with my body like perspiring too much when I exercise. She did a papsmear and did not find anything so I felt better. I worry about bad results.
0.190500	Even though I rarely experience health concerns, I have a  few family members that have been effected by chronic illnesses that have started as benign problems. The fear of finding out something serious in an appointment persists.
0.690500	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor is the possibility of finding out something is seriously wrong with me.
0.714300	I get anxious and worried because I feel like something is going to pop up in my health records that is just going to throw my life for a loop. It seems like having a doctor officially diagnose something makes it just that much more real and scary.
0.666700	I feel anxious or worried because I can never tell if my blood pressure will be of a normal reading and that is one of my biggest concerns
0.333300	That there might be something seriously wrong with me, my heart rate or oxygen levels are down, my blood work came back bad, the pain in feeling is something bad.
0.666700	I'm a single mom. I have two teenagers who rely on me and my financial and emotional support. I am the one constant in their lives. The one person they couldn't live without.  This is mainly the reason for my anxiousness when I visit the Dr's. I want to be there for my children as long as I possibly can.
0.642900	Mostly waiting a long time in general makes me nervous and it seems like waiting is longer than the actual exam from the doctor. Other than that, it's fear of having some kind of illness.
0.523800	Mostly it's the unknown. I certainly don't want to be sick, but being that I haven't kicked the smoking addiction, I know at some point I will be. 
0.714300	One of the things is my weight. I've always been overweight and I dread even getting on the scale and another person knowing my weight. I also worry I'll be lectured about it or it will be named as a cause for whatever ailment I might have. I often don't go to the doctor when I should so that my weight is never known or discussed. I also worry about my issue, which I may think is trivial, turning out to be something more serious than I thought.
0.738100	I worry that they will overlook my symptoms because they do not understand the complexities of my illness or that they do not take my condition seriously enough to educate themselves on it. 
0.714300	I have an innate fear of going to the doctor. For no apparent reason either. It is the fear of what the doctor would say, and finding something wrong with me. There is also the aspect where I would have to do things that are uncomfortable to myself, such as things that should stay private. On top of that, it is seeing the bill afterwards and paying it. 
0.142900	I would only visit a doctor if I was pretty sure there was something seriously wrong with me, so the higher source of stress would be whatever that is.
0.690500	Visiting the doctor can be worrying if you think she might find something bad or you don't know what's wrong. It can also be a relief if you know you're going to get better from something that's bothering you.
0.309500	The worst issue when visiting a doctor's office the the unknown factors.  The problem may be something simple or complex, the solution may be expensive and troublesome or it may be inexpensive and simple and the overall experience may feel good or bad, but the unknown factors involved make the experience worse.
0.571400	I would normally be anxious about my weight, my blood pressure, and my other health indicators. If the numbers are not good I might get scolded by the doctor, or worse, they might indicate I am not healthy. I would also feel anticipation to hear the results because I would be hoping for good numbers instead of bad ones. I would feel worry that I might get health news that I do not like.
0.595200	The only thing that could make me anxious is the feeling of uncertainty, when things aren't plain and sure I feel uneasy. Usually the results good or bad donât scare me but the lack of feedback and information does.

0.357100	usually when I have to go to the doctors office, it is because of an injury or an illness. This most of the time means that I am in some sort of pain or something is uncomfortable with my body. being that this is the case the majority of the time can cause the stress level to increase more than normal. by no means is it the doctors fault.

0.142900	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is his eagerness to prescribed drugs as a solution to most problems.

0.380952	Before USANA, there was Gull Laboratories. Dr. Wentz spent 20 years developing medical diagnostic test kits designed to detect infections and certain autoimmune disorders. In his experience, Dr. Wentz led to a heightened awareness of the importance of optimal nutrition in maintaining the health of human cells. This awareness, and the clear lack of advanced nutritional support in the market led to the sale of Gull Laboratories and the beginning of a new organization. In 1992, USANA was born. USANA offers its products to customers through a process called direct selling. Direct selling is a little different from what youâre probably used to seeing. Instead of selling our products at the grocery store, products are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers. You may ask why our business is set up this way, and the answer is centered on opportunity. USANA has always been about more than simply selling the best wellness products in the world to great peopleâwe wanted to give people the best opportunity to make their life the most successful it can be. Meaning we want people to be happy and healthy physically as well as financially. We use direct selling with the intention to help people get what they really want: freedom. Freedom to do what they want and when they want. The direct selling opportunity may not be for everyone on this planet, and thatâs OK. It doesnât need to be. We donât profess to have a quick âget richâ plan, or to have the âonly wayâ to earn a living. But we do claim the ability to give people another option to build wealth and establish financial stability, especially when they already love our product and are seeing great results. Itâs an opportunity for those looking to build their own business, but maybe wary of doing it all alone. Learn more about how to become an Associate or Preferred Customer of USANA here.

0.309524	But doctors can make a different kind of mistake. What I found strange when I first started running the health anxiety clinics was how many patients had been told they had a fatal disease when they did not!  Rather than making the mistake that everyone worries a doctor might make, namely missing the diagnosis of a deadly disease, their doctors worried them unnecessarily by diagnosing deadly diseases that were not present. That happened to me once. I had a swollen leg. Being a health worrier myself at that time, I had already made sure by repeatedly testing myself that I did not have the fatal kidney disease the doctor, when I finally got around to visiting him, informed me blithely that I had. I was able to dismiss his opinion out of hand.  But I have had patients who forever after worried about the disease they were told they had.

0.142857	not being able to get to see the doctor in a reasonable length of time do not like to sit in the waiting room with other sick people
0.333333	I feel that most of the anxiety I experience at a doctor's visit has to do with my remembering to relay all pertinent information and to ask all questions (especially since I tend to forget an important question fairly often).

0.142857	Finding out something that is totally unexpected. If I'm going in for pain in my ankle, I'm expecting some good/bad news regarding my ankle.  If I'm just going in for a simple biometric screening and leave being told I'm Hep-C or Diabetic, etc .

0.166667	I would probably only feel this way if I was worried about a really bad diagnosis.  I have been luck so far and nothing like that has happened to me.
0.547619	I worry what they are going to find wrong with me and I hate being referred to Doctor after Doctor. and they can't find what's wrong with me I just get real anxious and uneasy because it seems it always ends with me seeing Dr after Dr

0.642857	Any typical mortal man does not want to hear that there is something wrong. There is a certain inevitability for all men regardless of how much healthy for you programs one may ascribe to use
0.357143	Sometimes I do when I'm not sure what is bothering me. I get that little sense of dread that it could be something bad.
0.619048	The feeling of being rushed and not taken seriously is a worry. Which leads to anxiety about whether the doctor actually paid attention or not.
0.452381	I worry a lot about how much it will cost.  I also get very irritated at making an appointment, getting there early, then waiting an hour or more to be seen
0.238095	Get because he might tell me something wrong and I get so nervous if my health is bad and my heart starts to race and but I know everything is ok

0.142857	If I have some new problem that is just showing and we are seeing it for the first time. I know we will figure it out
0.785714	The diagnosis is what makes me anxious, because I just was told that I was in renal failure and needed to go on dialysis. I was so anxious that I had to take an extra clonapen that is part of the instruction that my other doctor ordered to me. Than I think that is when the worried feeling comes in.  He explains very slowly and clearly to where I am able to understand what my future holds for me.  He always keeps the door open for any problems. 
0.309524	Nothing really makes me anxious  at the doctor office, but sometimes waiting in the wait room or waiting on doctor makes me anxious. 
0.309524	that something may have come up that causes me to be sicker than i thought i was worries me to no end
0.285714	I trust my doctor and i am always relaxed and not worried.  I always trust and feel great when I see my doctor.  Never any concerns.
0.357143	I am not sure, but I must be anxious because my blood pressure is always inflated at the doctor's office. Maybe it is the drive into the city, which I do not do very often. I don't think I am anxious over the visit or exam really, unless I am worried that I have a condition that is worrisome... Like thinking I have cancer or something like that.

0.190476	Not usually feeling anxious so I can't remember an situation or office visit where I did feel anxious or worried as I usually have a good outcome and feel I have been helped very much by the visit
0.619048	I don't want a bad diagnosis but not knowing is worse. That is why I go. I also don't want uncomfortable procedures done.

0.571429	The thought that there might be something medically wrong with me or I may be unhealthy. I am afraid they will tell me bad news.
0.523810	"In general, I have had mostly negative experiences with doctors previously. I have several painful chronic conditions that have gone undiagnosed for decades. Past incompetence and being told that it's ""all in my head"" has made me generally anxious about doctor's appointments. I'm getting over it a bit now though."
0.380952	What makes me feel worried is not being successful and reaching me goal in life and being broke, i want to achieve my goals and be happy

0.714286	Taking off my clothes and having a check up makes me anxious and worried. I do not like a doctor that does not listen and hurries through the appointment so he or she can go on to the next patient. It makes me anxious when the doctor does not take time with me. I ask alot of questions. 
0.285714	The only time I might feel anxious or worried is when I have symtoms for which  I've had some sort of testing/biopsy/x-ray/CT/MRI, etc, and the doctor is going to inform me of the results.

0.357143	Just having to see the Doctor is enough to make anyone, me a little anxious. Fortunately for me, I have always gotten good news, everything is and has been fine. There is always that chance that some day I could get some not so good news.

0.619048	I'm just most anxious about to see if there is actually something wrong or if it is just something I'm worried about but there is actually nothing wrong with me. Plus how much will cost

0.142857	I don't really know; it's been a long time since I've needed to see a doctor, so nothing springs to mind.
0.761905	I don't like talking or being around people so it's very stressful to have to come in contact with so many people and to go outside. It's also invasive to be examined and to ask questions, and it's hard to give complete answers.
0.809524	im afraid i will get bad news or i will have too get a shot that makes me very anxious other then that i trust my doctor 
0.285714	This is tough since I am so comfortable going to the doctor.  I am only anxious or worried if the result keeps me out of work for any period of time.  The office is clean and cheery.  The office staff is always friendly.  I know everyone by name.  The cost of a visit has gone up dramatically so I suppose that makes me anxious.  I do worry that I might not be able to afford prescriptions since they also have gone up.  It seems like my paycheck is going for a higher rate of medical things.  I stopped buying anything that isn't an absolute necessity.

0.547619	It is kind of a worrying feeling going to the doctor's office since it is not something done for me all of the time.

0.190476	Sometimes the doctor isn't in a good mood and when I come in he doesn't seem very happy. He also yelled at me once for not following one simple direction which lowered my opinion about him, but overall, he's the best doctor

0.523810	You never know what might be going on in your body. It's always a worrying feeling getting test results back . Depending on the rest you never know what to think or what to expect . 
0.261905	If I am very bad off sick and think I might have a bad disease I am afraid my doctor might give me some bad news telling me I have cancer or something and it's going to kill me and I only have so much time to get my things in order

0.833333	I feel most anxious or worried when I start thinking that they don't believe what I am saying. I am also worried that they are going to get angry with me for things I do or don't do. 
0.333333	Typically I'm neither anxious or worried when visiting the doctor. If I do become anxious or worried it most likely because I'm going into surgery, which in that situation anyone would be worried. But if I have faith in the doctor I have nothing to worry about.

0.571429	I don't feel anxious more annoyed. I feel like I end up wasting my time and get little results. I feel like I have to keep going back and wasting more money.
0.404762	What is my lab work going to show?  Is my thyroid concdition going to be better or worse.  If worse, what is he going to suggest?  How am I going to get to consider that all of my immune disorders are related to my MS diagnosis of many years ago which he thinks is totally gone?
0.571429	When is was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had to make a decision on the best treatment plan for me.  I relied on my primary care physician to talk with me about all options.
0.595238	I worry that I won't bring up all relevant health information and we will miss something important. I know a lot of diseases can be asymptomatic, so I am just concerned that small things might actually be related to an underlying issue.
0.285714	I'm at an age where I don't want my doctor to find anything wrong with me, but at my age that isn't going to happen. So it becomes, what surprise are you going to spring on me now?

0.928571	"They will do what every other doctor has done in the past to me. They will treat me like everyone else. They will see that I am poor, and automatically assume I am there for ""another"" fix, or there for free pain drugs. I'm there becuase I have a legetiment issue with my body or mind, and don't know where else to go. But what they see is a poor, druggie looking to get another hit of their favorit cocktail. They see a ""ignorant hick"" that is incapable of processing complex information such as personal heath. They don't see an individual. They either see an issue they don't want to deal with, or a nice little bonus paycheck. The prior dismiss all my problems stating, ""it's nothing to worry about becuase I (the doctor) don't know at it is,"" the later stating, ""well, I see that Medicaid will pay for these sixteen different tests, let's do them all! (when none of them are nessesary)."" They lie, cheat, and steal like everyone else with power and money.

0.809524	I worry he/she won't believe anything I say nor takes the time needed to diagnose a condition or illness I may have
0.333333	Visiting a doctor is just uneasy  feeling. You are  usually  in a flimsy gown and sitting on a hard table. It is just an unnatural  setting 
0.309524	Getting on the scale and having my blood work done and going over the results and how to make them better

0.571429	Even though I am feeling all right I always wonder whether or not the doctor will diagnose me as having some sort of an ailment.
0.761905	It depends on why I am there. If I have gone for my quarterly check-up I am generally fine. However if I am there because of unexplained illness and/or pain I tend to worry until I am told what the problem is and what is needed to do to correct it.
