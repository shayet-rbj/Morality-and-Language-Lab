It prompted me to see my health as an ongoing process rather than a treat-as-needed project. I learned that medical tests are valuable indicators but subject to variables and can point to other issues that might need attention as well.  I underwent treatment that resolved problems at the onset but now am dealing with other issues (40 years later) that evolved from that original treatment.  I experience anxiety over these things but have a lot more knowledge about it all and that makes me feel that I can conquer the problems.

1	I am currently pregnt, so I have been doing a lot of research online about possible things that could affect my pregncy and make it more complicated. One thing is high blood pressure and how it is linked to pre-eclampsia. I read about how if you have high blood pressure then they will likely do a urine test to see if there is protein in it, which is a sign of pre-eclampsia.

1	A few years ago I had a friend that was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she was admitted into a cancer treatment center. She was very worried about what kind of processes and procedures she would go through. I was able to talk to her about what she may experience because my father was also diagnosed with cancer and I watched him suffer through it for 6 months going through all sorts of different treatments.

My personal doctor finally asked at a physical if I was still having chest pain. They FINALLY did a stress test. Two parts of my heart were not lighting up. (not getting blood flow). They did not even bother running the test. Maybe because I was a woman, not terribly old, I don't know why they would not order a stress test. But I am glad I never let them do carpel tunnel surgery.
1	Recently i had extreme pain in my hip every time i stood up, but there was no grinding in my hip, and i had no build up to the symptoms. I figured it was probably something in my lower back, since i have gained weight and that has affected my posture, and i turned out to be right

I went to a doctor about it and they confirmed that it was that.

1	My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.

-1	I suppose this would have been associated with my father's cancer, where I had to essentially inform myself about the things he should/shouldn't eat during that point in time, especially since he didn't clearly discuss these issues since I was a teenager (he didn't want me worrying).
-1	I was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2011. I've endured five surgeries in 2001. Leaving me with menopause, limited mobility in certain life duties. Such as doing stressful, heavy weight work. Which in my mind I will but my body gives out. Hypertension makes the depression kick in. They give me pills for seizures and pain. However I can't afford them so I get generic and that does nothing.

1	The flu hit my family last week.  We had our flu shots so our fevers weren't extremely high (less than 101).  The accompanying symptoms were severe fatigue, cough, nausea and an extreme sore throat.  I was concerned because in the past my children have had atypical symptoms for strep throat (pain, nausea but no fever). However, I knew that a cough wasn't typical either.  I watched my son's throat for a few days and there weren't any unusual signs until last Thursday night when white spots started showing up.  At that point, my usual wait and see on a fever and cough symptoms turned into a doctor's appointment.  I've learned to wait out viruses but not to mess with what could be a possible strep.  Thankfully it wasn't strep but I knew what to look for and be concerned from past experience.

So I started the orientation and explained how to use the treadmill safely, despite not being ""properly"" trained."

1	I used a thermometer to measure my significant other's body temperature. The temperature was 103Â°F. We went to the doctor immediately.
1	Just last night my daughter said she had a sore throat. I looked at it with a flashlight. There were whiteish/yellow patches on her tonsils. I told her she may have strep. I know that the first thing a doctor asks when you take a child in for strep is if they also have a cough, which she did not. That's an indicator for them to actually do the strep test. Since she didn't have a cough, the doctor did the strep test on her this morning and it was positive.
-1	I could just tell from having bronchitis in elementary school, that once again in High School it came back. The cough was a different cough than just being very head-cold sick.

Then my mother went to her cardiologist and after an echocardiogram, he told my mother to take the water pill every other day.  Even though her doctors are in the same group, the cardiologist had not looked at her recent lab reports and her primary care physician's recommendations.  I called her PCP's office and spoke to her nurse and explained the situation.  I requested her PCP call the cardiologist and consult about her lab reports.  She did call him and together they came up with a solution to the problem.

1	I worked on an ambulance as an EMT.  I had to use my knowledge about health issues every time I went to work.

I have a lot of family and friends who refer people they know to me when they first find out that their son or daughter is also diagnosed. It is one area I feel highly knowledgeable in without ever having gone to school for it. I once was at the pediatrician and the doctor asked if I would be okay going to the next room over to talk to a mom who had just found out about her son. They thought it might be helpful for me to come in as an experienced mom in this matter. I really enjoyed it and the mom seemed to leave feeling at least somewhat better about the future.

Being proactive is important.

-1	I work in a specialized and private hand clinic. Sometimes when patients come up to the window complaining of hand pain and such, I can instantly diagnose their disease. Of course, I don't have the license to clearly diagnose them and give them medical advice without an official diagnosis so I wait until the doctor can.
-1	When I was young, both my big toes got infected at the same time, for some reason. The doctor said I needed surgery. But I had heard somewhere that for an  infected toe, you should soak it repeatedly in saltwater--which I did, and the infections went away.

1	I guess any atomy exam I've taken would fit this since those literally involved demonstrating medical knowledge, but outside of school I guess the most fitting thing I can think of was when a friend of mine wasn't feeling well and wasn't sure his symptoms meant. I sussed out based on what he was experiencing that it was probably a UTI that was progressing towards the bladder and kidneys, and recommended he see a doctor immediately. It was indeed a bladder infection, and he was able to get effective treatment. I'm glad that my knowledge of that particular health condition helped, as he might not have sought treatment right away otherwise.

I knew that it would be more beneficial for the health of the baby and myself if I had a c section right away, then if I waited to try and induce labor, go through the practice for the next few days and wear out both my body and the baby.  Having knowledge and understanding helped me make a very important medical decision and the health of my baby benefited from that decision.

In particular, my ability to convert folate to a useble form is compromised by about 70%. This has an effect on the efficiency of many methylation and detox pathways in my body. This also means I am more suspectible to certain health issues (fertility issues, depression, heart and vascular disease, Parkinson's). Some experts believe there are dietary and nutritiol options that can help to offset some of the effects of the ""mutation."" I am pretty well versed in what they are at this point."
