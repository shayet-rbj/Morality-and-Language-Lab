-1	That he might find something wrong that I didn't know about.
-1	nothing makes me feel anxieties or worried when visting the doctors offices around the world in the united states. 
1	Having someone who I do not see often look me over concerns me. I get anxious when they check my heart rate and such which probably contributes to my heart rate going up. They sometimes try to talk while checking my heart rate which makes me more anxious as I have to participate in a conversation.
-1	THat something will be wrong with me.
-1	I never feel worried. I just go in and get what I need to get done. I feel like you only can worry about what you can control and that is getting checked up.
-1	I don't want to hear any bad news.  I have had enough of that.  Scared he might find something...just want everything to be o.k.
-1	I sometimes think about how much the visit to the doctor will cost me. I think of it more as an annoyance than I'm being taken advantage of.
1	What makes me most anxious is the fear that my doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I also fear many of the procedures, as well as just interacting with medical people in general. The latter comes with me just having an avoidant personality disorder.
1	What makes me the most worried is if it's something serious or not. I personally don't have health insurance so anything serious would also probably cost me a lot of money out of pocket. This is particularly worrisome as my personal income isn't that high either.
1	What makes me the most anxious and worried is that they do not do a thorough examination.  They move patients through like they are cattle and it's frustrating. People deserve a hundred percent of the  doctors attention for a complete physical that should really include blood work after a certain age. I'm worried that the doctors are working so quickly that they will miss something serious and by the time it's caught it will be too late and I'll end up dying from something that could have been fixed had it been caught in a timely manner. It scared me to think that could happen to me. 
-1	There is always anxiety when having annual tests to detect things that might've popped up since the last examination, i.e. breast examines, pap smears, etc.  Its almost like there is some invading organisium that enters your body since the last exam and you won't know you're cleared until the results come back that you're ok.
1	I always feel like they will find something else wrong with me, I take enough meds now
1	Visiting the doctor makes me feel anxious, and this is obvious when my blood pressure is much higher than normal when taken by health professionals.  My doctor works with me on this matter, and trusts me to report my self-test blood pressure readings. I think there are always unknowns when going to the doctor. You may think you are fine, but the doctor might find something to prove otherwise. I dread getting blood drawn because it is painful. You never know how experienced the person taking your blood is going to be (i.e. they might miss the vein a few times and poke you).
-1	I'm just always a little anxious.  I have a family history of certain diseases and illnesses.  Sometimes I worry that I'm going to be diagnosed with one of these myself 
-1	"Well I'm usually pregnant and towards the end of the pregnancy they ""check"" you for dilation. I just hate that. And I hate pap smears too, which are similar in uncomfortable feeling."
-1	I feel no worries or nerves when I walk into the office, because I know she will take good care of me. She has never let me down, and knows exactly how to cure me and knows what she needs to do in order to get me to feel better. 
1	I get most anxious about being diagnosed with something else, haha. The doctor doesn't make me nervous, just the whole idea of potentially having another thing wrong with me.
1	Not always taking care of myself and putting others before me. Also being naked is never fun and doing my yearly exams suck
-1	I feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office because I can never be completely sure what diagnosis I am going to get. It would be silly to say I wasn't worried or anxious that I could get some negative news regarding my health.
1	"The fact that I don't always understand their ""English"" and I know that the quality of our medical professionals has declined.  They don't spend a lot of time with patient care because they have to process so many in order to make money.  They don't always order the tests they should because the insurance companies give the clinics a certain amount of money for the number of patients they have.  If they can keep the testing down they will have money left at the end of the fiscal year and they all get bonuses from the money left.  Sad.  Patients suffer."
1	I have copd and it is a illiness that has no known treatments that will cure the illiness.  I know that I am living on borrowed time and I am going downhill fast. each time I see the doctor and I hear that my condition has worsened I worry about how much time I have left.

-1	I feel worried that the treatment prescribed may not be working and we'll have to start all over with something new
-1	I only worry about cancer, since it seems to be the hidden disease that pops up on people sometimes without warning.  This is about the only thing that worries me that one day it will show up on some sort of test.  
-1	The thing that makes me the most anxious is going in to see the doctor for something minimal and finding out that it was a serious problem. I still remember the time I went to the doctor with my mother to get her checked up and during the time she thought it would be a good idea for me to get checked out too. When we went there the nurse said that everything was fine with my mother so I felt relieved but when she went to my results she had said I had a few traces of kidney stones in me. I began to worry because I always saw myself as very healthy but she reassured me it wasn't that big of a deal.
-1	I usually not worried unless there's something in my gut telling me there is something seriously wrong with me

That is always in the back of my mind, that I may be dying or have to get a shot, those are about the only things that worry me about going to the doctor.
1	The appointment is rushed through like they have a fire in their pants. It is cold in the second waiting room and the seating is uncomfortable. If I am sick ,which is usually the case, I just want to be at home in my bed with warm covers over my body Being sick and/or in pain is not a condition I want uno have. I just want to go home to my own software bed with a cup of hot tea. I get more relief from staying comfortable in my own home then going outside in the cold, driving my car to said appointment, finding a parking place(even though I have a disable placard there never is enough parking in the very full parking lot, waiting an uncalled for  amount of time waiting and going to a pharmacy to pick up a medicine and getting back home. Ick!!!!!!!

-1	I do not have an issue when I go to see my doctor. I know my own body and I know if there is something wrong, I let him know the symptoms and we deal with it.
-1	It makes me worried because doctors are not taught enough about natural approaches for health.  When you bring up anything that does not pertain to a prescription, they just wont listen. 
-1	Just the thought that some illness may be discovered that I have.
1	that I will be diagnosed with something that hard to cure. or that he will tell me something bad.  and doctors never believe in alternative medicine

1	I struggle with my weight and it makes me uncomfortable when at the doctors, also I'm always worried that there is the possibility that they will find something truly wrong and expensive.
1	I have social anxiety, so just getting to the doctor and actually going are tough for me. I feel so much anxiety when I need to visit my doctor, 
1	Believe it or not, the smell. After that, I feel anxious sometimes being around sick people. Filly, I just get an uneasy feeling whenever I see a nurse or physician. Don't know why.

-1	I'm concerned there will be more bad news regarding my condition. I get monthly blood draws and sometimes the news is not good.
1	I believe it is all pyschological because most of the time when you go to the doctor something is wrong. So then when you go for a regular visit those same feelings come back. The ones you had when you were sick, injured or didn't even know what was wrong  in the first place. Some of the uncertainty is also worrying about my loved ones if something was in fact wrong with me. What also contributes to the uncertainty is not understanding medical terminology and if whether or not what you are being told is actually correct.
1	"In general, I have had mostly negative experiences with doctors previously. I have several painful chronic conditions that have gone undiagnosed for decades. Past incompetence and being told that it's ""all in my head"" has made me generally anxious about doctor's appointments. I'm getting over it a bit now though."
1	mainly the things that make me most worried or anxious are the follow-up appointments and anything new she might find
-1	Anytime I go I am worried . Its just my nature . I am a worrier . There is a lot of family medical problems . So anytime I go I cant help but worry and think about the possibilities that I could have something major wrong with me . I am worried that the routine check up will end up with me having cancer or something horrible like that . It all makes me anxious . I am also worried that we might miss something . That I forget something that I wanted to talk to her about ,so we end up missing it . I feel like she does a good job but I worry a lot about dying young like my father . The whole thing is pretty nerve racking but so far so good . She makes me feel like everything is going to be ok .
-1	I think the anticipation that you might get bad news will give your that anxious or worried feeling. 
1	How doctors decide to take care of uses and problems people have! Along with side effects from medicine and treatment  
1	There's not really anything specific that makes me anxious. I think I just dislike getting examined by people in general.

-1	I worry over the fact that i may have a serious medical issue that may need surgery or something else real serious
1	He'll put me on some medicine and try to be scary to me because I'm fat and uglier and obese. I'm sacred of doctors

1	I just get most anxious when I get shots, have to have an IV, and when I have to get blood drawn.  I also get anxious when I have to give a urine sample.

1	I feel anxious to you when I visit doctors because I do not know what I can diagnose, that is very scary.. is scary
-1	I meant to put anxious and nervous sometimes around doctors because it depends on why I am going to the doctors for. If it is something serious then I would feel nervous and anxious. 
-1	sometimes it's a little scary but most of the time it's ok and there is nothing to worry about. so I'm not that worried about seeing the doctoe
-1	i'm afraid to learn more bad news from my doctor about my condition that i didn't want to know. Ann visiting doctor's office everytime does make very anxious and nervous
1	When I don't know what is wrong with me and the doctor can't seem to find out either. It make me anxious and uncomfortable, but I try to remain calm so I can get accurate tests done.
-1	
-1	mabey when test results are in a little anxious but not worried. I all way feel positive when tested.It keeps my spirt up and I can do other things.
1	Just what they may find. Something that I wasn't expecting. Me needing a treatment I can't afford. Just the whole experience really.

-1	I feel anxious and worried on my doctor visits sometimes because I may be confronted with some bad news health-wise. Sometimes I feel like I might get bad news about a procedure or test that I've gone through.
1	Might be something wrong with me that is serious.  I really believe that God put all cures here on earth and you must follow what he intended.  I think a lot of doctors should not be doctors but went into medicine for the money.  Very disturbing.  I think most medications do more harm than good.  I believe in prayer and natural medicine.  Western medicine is so overrated and people should really research alternatives.
1	I fear most that they won't find a solution to the problem I'm having. My pains are real and sometimes they act like I'm faking it.
-1	The final cost of the bill I'm going to be receiving from the doctor. Doctors charge way too much for visits, I think so.
-1	I don't feel too worried or anxious when I visit the doctor. I only get annoyed every time my weight is brought up. I also don't like it when they have to draw blood or if I have to pee in a cup.
1	I had GAD, so even small issues cause my anxiety to kick into overdrive.
1	If I don't get a straight answer or the look on the Doctor's face is expressionless, which tends to get me feeling worried and anxious
-1	When I have a new symptom or symptoms knowing that my smoking is putting me at risk of developing cancer.
-1	I worry about callbacks from the office for medical tests like mammograms and Pap tests. I am relieved when all is good.
1	Just the act of going to see the doctor.  There's sick people everywhere, the office is usually cold, especially in the examination room..  You often have to wait alone in the exam room for a few minutes which increases anxiety..  Shots aren't too bad, but it's still a needle so those suck..
1	When Im at the doctors and then they come in and look like they need to tell you something real important. 
1	When results come back and i feel nervous for i dont think im in good health condition i always think that is the case even beforehand

1	I am most worried that he will neglect to find the source of the problem, and I will die due to an error that was easily preventable with a little care for his job.

They do not care for their patients anymore, they just milk them for their sheckles.
-1	I DON'T LIKE BEING ILL, BUT I SEE OTHER PEOPLE WORSE OFF THAN I AM AND I PRAY FOR THEIR HEALING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES. MY MIND IMMEDIATELY FORGET ABOUT MYSELF WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE NOT SO WELL OFF.

1	My doctoe rushes me through and out. I don't quite feel taken seriously. He's just now sending me to specialists I've needed to see and been asking to see for the year that I've been seeing him. And he doesn't prescribe medications for anything.

Are you sure you havent drank this week? its patronizing. 
1	Afraid if there's going be a long wait.

I should realize this before I even get into the doctors office, but it still freaks me out. Maybe thats something Ill work on.
1	Finding out what the test results, how his staff are going to treat me, and weary I've recommend me to get surgery.

Like I said I am smart and powerful there is only so much many times before I no longer walk away.  It's common sense.  Follow the rules.  However there still are people who don't do that.  Grown adults too.  What makes me feel anxious or worried at the doctor's office is they won't help me because I can't pay for it.  If that happens I have to figure it out on my own.  
1	I just really get nervous going to the doctor I don't know why have always felt that way. Not knowing getting blood test waiting on results. Financial aspect.

When I went to the county clinic for birth control they told me I couldn't have birth control until I allowed them to examine me even though I have never had sex other than being raped and I was hysterically crying. I just wanted to get birth control because I'm getting married and want to be prepared but I ended up leaving with nothing and felt so ashamed.

I went through a period of anxiety while waiting for the results, which were negative, but in general I have not worries at the doctor's office. 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the long wait in the lobby and after waiting for so long, the doctor only gives you a small amount of time. That doesn't provide you enough time to ensure all questions and answers are given.

-1	I'm usually just worried that something is going to be seriously wrong with me. Or that the doctor will miss something important.
1	These feelings come when there is an issue and I'm unsure of what to expect. These feelings can come if I gain weight or having been eating unhealthy. 
1	I worry about what is wrong with me. The doctor doesn't make me feel this way, and I am hoping whatever is wrong isn't serious. It's just the whole waiting game I guess.
1	i feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office in case that i should hear something i don't want to hear or hear bad news. 
1	I guess the only thing that truly makes me feel anxious or worried is just stupid bs that's in my head. I feel ashamed of myself for a variety of reasons, especially when it comes to finances and lack of being able to afford insurance. My doctor has never given me a reason to feel these things though, and has actually helped aleve some of these worries and concerns.
-1	They may find something wrong with me. The wait may be too long and too many sick people around. I feel anxious if my initial blood pressure number is too high due to weight gain sometimes

1	I am afraid that the doctor will find something seriously wrong with me. I am also afraid that the doctor will make a mistake or mis-prescribe me a wrong medication. I also feel that the doctors do not really listen when I tell them something. 
-1	What makes me a little bit worried about visiting the doctors office is that he will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of.

1	I'm worried that he may find some serious condition that requires either expensive tests or expensive medications.
1	I think most people feel that way.  You never know what they will find and it is an anxious feeling every time.
1	I just feel anxious because you never know what the doctor is going to say about why you went in to see them that day. There's always a possibility for something to go wrong or it could just be good news. Either way it just depends
-1	I AM ALWAYS WORRIED THAT I WILL HAVE A FATILE DIAGNOSIS IF I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY OWN BODY.
1	I'm always scared because I have lots of health problems in my family history. I am always scared that something is going to come back bad or a simple ache is going to be so much more than just a simple ache. I am always worried about what they will recommend or what they have to say.
-1	Only when there's a new test result is the time I get worried. Also, when more testing is needed would be another I get anxious or worried.
-1	Knowing that you will likely find out what is wrong with you and hoping that it's not something expensive or bad. Also, hoping you get worthwhile information out of going in relation to the cost of going. Or the possibility of having to feel pain from procedures.
-1	The most anxious part of visiting the doctors office is waiting because I feel like I really want to get it done and over with.
-1	What makes me feel anxious about visiting a doctors office is having a complete stranger viewing my body and touching me.
1	What makes me feel anxious is being diagnosed with an incurable illness such as Cancer or MS. Also, if they are not able to diagnose what's going on with me
-1	For the most part I am not anxious or worried when I visits the doctor.  If I am very sick or notice something unusual, I might be a bit worried, but so far I have been lucky.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctors office. My doctor makes me feel relaxed. I do not worry because my doctor is very knowledgeable.
-1	I guess going to the doctor makes you anxious is not knowing whats wrong with you and how much is it going to cost.
1	"I have what I would call ""doctors anxiety"".  I tend to always get nervous when I go to a doctor.  Once I'm there, and start seeing the doctor, I usually feel better and less anxious."
-1	I feel very anxious when I go to see my doctor because she is always telling me to lose weight and telling me how lazy I am so I don't like my doctor a whole lot.
-1	I might have to waste some time in the waiting room.  I prefer to spend my time as I choose to spend it.
-1	The language barrier.
1	I just tend to worry that there may be something wrong with me. My family has had a history of heart and cancer issues, and I always fear that one of those, or something else entirely will affect me at some point.
1	My biggest worry is that I'll get diagnosed with a disease like cancer. When I was younger I felt invincible, but as I grow older I worry. I'm a lot more conscious of different medical problems I could develop and be diagnosed with. Other than that I don't mind the trip.
-1	The thought of the doctor finding something else wrong that I wasn't aware of or couldn't fathom. I don't like surprises like that.
1	There is always the possibility of finding out something is really wrong or that something is going to be extremity difficult to treat. 
-1	Just the fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether the doctor will find somethng wrong with me, and if he does find something wrong, how serious will the condition be. 
-1	I just hope he doesn't come to me with bad news with something wrong. I am most fearful of cancer which can strike anyone without warning, and causes emotional harm for the whole family.
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious is not knowing how much time I will have to wait to see the doctor. I usually have to wait 1-1/2 to 2 hours to see her despite having an appointment. Once, a few years ago, I missed an important meeting at work because I wrongly assumed that my doctor's visit would be over in about an hour; it ended up being 2 hours because I had to wait a long time to see her, and my actual time with her was about 15 minutes. 
1	I think for me there is always the fear of what will they find that I don't know about, the what if something is really wrong fear. Other than that the exam, albeit uncomfortable at times is not really an issue. 
1	I feel most anxious or worried when I am going in for a specific reason instead of a general check up
1	I am always worried something else will be wrong with me than just what I am going in for...or that whatever I have is worse than what I think. Additionally, I am always worried about remembering the things I want to ask, and if I will have enough time to ask the questions I have. So it makes me really anxious and worried. 
1	I think I always think the worst when I go, I act as if I am going to walk in and they're going to tell me I have some deadly disease. I usually feel like when I leave I feel better automatically no matter what is wrong just because I find out there is nothing wrong with me (that can be long term bad).
1	I am most anxious when I am waiting for my doctor to tell me the results of my annual test - whether I am maintaining my efforts to stay healthy.
1	I usually present with a specific problem.  Feeling somewhat anxious about a new problem is a normal response.
1	With all of the diseases around today. You never know where you have sat next to someone who was sick and they sneezed of coughed on you. Now you have what they have. I do not feel at ease until after I have left the doctors office and I get a clean bill of health. 
1	I dont take the best care of my health so I am always worried the doctor will find something wrong with me
-1	I was injured right before football season and wanted to know how long I was going to be out. It took them a minute to give me the results so I got anxious with all of the waiting. Then I got injured later on in life during the football season and it was the same situation. I guess I was more impatient then anxious 
-1	Finding out something could possibly be wrong with me that I brushed off. If I don't think there's a problem, I don't mention it. 
1	I worry that I will be repeatedly misdiagnosed. It worries me that she only wants to continuously prescribe medication on top of medications. She treats you like a test dummy with medication. 
1	I am fearful of any health conditions I might be diagnosed with, nervous about the vitals, taking of blood, and of the office in general.
-1	none I do not feel anxious when I visit my doctors office she is truly a wonderful doctor and she keeps my up to date with my health
1	There is always some anxiety that if you were going to the doctor for a reason it may be worse than you expect. I also have some trepidation regarding wait times in my physicians office. 
-1	I am usually most anxious about getting there and back since I don't drive, and having to miss work. Since I might be worried about these things, it's possible that I will forget to mention something important in the appointment.
1	having contracted more serious conditions, due to age, progressing pre-existing conditions. Aging seems to just bring on more and more issues
1	I get worried that the doctor will find something is seriously wrong with me and I'll be blindsided by the diagnosis. I once had a regular checkup with my OB GYN where my doctor suspected I had a lump and referred me for a mammogram. This was alarming as I had no idea that would be an issue. I was also in my 20s. The mammogram showed that I was fine. But now I worry about it happening again.
-1	I'm turally anxious, so I feel that way about most new/unusual experiences.
1	When I do go to the doctors office, because past doctors have never believed me on my condition I was always feeling anxious and worried throughout the visit. However, this has slowly went away. Still for some visits I become anxious or worried that my conditions may be developing further in a negative way. 
1	I hate shots. I hate shots a LOT. I'm always in fear that my affliction will result in a blood test or a shot of some sort and that's when I get REALLY tense.
-1	I have never been anxious about anything in my life and to make it clear I don't like these types of questions
-1	that I may not have made the desired progress or that my tests will reveal some other medical issue.
-1	I don't really stress much because I know my body.  I have a slight degree about the worry that something else might appear. but all in all I trust my doctor.
1	The possibility of health issues is always a concern. However, I am quite an anxious individual, so just the base process of attending this appointment fills me with an uneasiness and a sense of dread. I feel a lack of confidence and a sense of embarrassment, even seemingly without just cause.
-1	I usually don't feel anxious at the doctor. But sometimes I feel anxious at the doctor with my kids, I just want them to be healthy and I get nervous if something is wrong.
-1	when i am waiting for test results. I do not know if it is good or bad. I want to educate myself and make sure the best desion is made
-1	The thing that worries the most is if my insurance is going to cover things that I might need to do. This bothers me more than any kind of procedure that I can imagine getting.
1	I am scared he might recommend a procedure that I won't be able to afford, si I don't have health insurance.
1	I feel anxious and worried about things that's hard for me to change. I wish everything in life was just better than it is now. 
1	I'm always wondering what is the doctor gonna find. I lost a parent to cancer at a young age so I always think I'm going to get a cancer diagnosis.
1	I feel most anxious about the cost of the procedures that my doctor may prescribe. Sometimes my doctor wants tests run that I can't afford 
1	Visiting the doctors office will always make me anxious due to the reason of the visit, or the idea that maybe the results of an analysis of blood work or urine sample is positive. Also getting an injection or the idea of getting an operation is frightening to me. The feeling is competently normal. Even if you are just doing a routine check up . The doctor can have a lot of patients to see before you ,and the idea of waiting in line for 30 min can make me anxious. You always assume the worst even if you have a mild cold or headache. With the flu season you always feel like you are the next person to have gotten it . Or when you get a mild rash from eating something with  citrus in it. Other than that I'm very happy after seeing my physician . It is calming  to know that everything is ok.
-1	When I go to the doctor I'm always worried they will find something wrong. It's just a crazy feeling. Why ? I don't know.Its like that all of the time no matter what the reason for me being there.
-1	The sick patients make me worried. You go in for one thing and leave with something else. The hospital lobby is considered the dirtiest place  ever.
1	I worry that my blood pressure will be high again and that worry makes it worse.  I also worry that my disease will be out of remission and I will not be able to work.
1	I'm always anxious and worried while in the doctor's office because I don't want negative or bad news
-1	Just hearing her 'official' word on lab results, I'd say. I've normally already looked at the numbers thanks to an online portal where they post results, but I don't necessarily know what they mean and I don't generally feel like doing research (e.g. to see if a small change in my triglycerides is significant) when I know I'll see her within a week (lab work always a week before I see her, results usually online a few days prior to appointment with her). It's ever so slight. 
1	I worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me. I am relatively young and in good health, but I am always concerned that something will come up that I am not expecting. I am too anxious of a person over all, so this is really in line with my personality.
1	I am anxious when I am unsure of the outcome and I become nervous. I do not like to feel nervous. I dont want to be real bad sick. 
1	I am greatly uncomfortable getting blood drawn. I immediately get very fearful of this once I step into the doctors office. It's uncomfortable to have someone touch you and to not have clothes on, etc.
-1	The thought of them saying something negative or harmful. Also I might be worried about a outcome of a procedure or test.
1	What might come of the visit. Not seeing my doctor, just what may or may not be wrong.
1	When I have a new doctor, I feel  nervous. When I think I am going to  get bad news I also get worried .
1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office when I am awaiting any test results or physical examitions. I worry because I fear something may be wrong and I would need medical treatment.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is just not knowing.  Not knowing on a few visits if I was going to have to do a basic test as the hospital and all the trouble that entails.  That's all. 
1	"I call the chair that I sit in closest to the doctor the ""hot seat"".  :o)  I am always a little nervous going to the doctor.  I wonder if what I am going in for might be something silly and I am making a big deal about a small thing.  Also I worry that they won't find whatever is going on with me and after testing they don't find anything.  I feel a little foolish after that."
1	I feel most anxious and worried when I visit my doctor concerning the results of an MRI, Xray, CT Scan or etc... Given the health history of my family, it canput you on the edge, but even more so, this disease- Sarcoid- is even more tense. 
1	When visiting the doctors off I feel scared more than anything due to the concern that anything can happen. I always feel nervous when entering the doctors office due to just the unknown of what could happen upon entering.
-1	Having had cancer twice, and with a family history of cancer, I am always concerned that cancer may show up in a new area of my body or that my previous cancer may return.  I am always assured that the tests continue to be negative and that the cancer is in remission.  The doctor has even told me that I can be considered cancer free but the thought is always in the back of my mind.
1	i feel uneasy beause i am worried about the outcome and what i would have do do for treatment if i need some. i had cancer in my family, breast removable and i sm worried that i might have to go though that or but my family through that.
-1	Because I have dealt with cancer in the past, this would be my most main concern when going for check-ups - that they would feel something suspicious.

1	I feel worried when I go to the doctor office I feel that they might tell me something wrong about my health 
-1	Nothing as I have total confidence in him and his staff as well as the two specialists that I see in a regular basis. If they had not done the right thing by me in the past I would not be here now.
1	I feel worried because I'm a very secretive and self-reliant person. Visiting the doctor is all about depending on someone else and letting them examine and judge you. I don't trust them not to reveal my persol information to anyone they see fit, even if I would strongly object.
1	I dont like waiting. Then I worry that they might find something wrong with me.
-1	When I go to see my doctor I have a certain mindset. I do not let my emotions interfere with my mind, because as we know it can be deter mental to your health. So when I go to see my physician I usually listen to some calm music, trying to calm my nerves if anything, because as any human being we all have emotions, but we can control them, that's matter of practice. So in nutshell when I see my doctor I do not feel anxious or worried about anything and give myself the best chance possible to win. My mind is always on point, I am awake and aware.
1	Since I'm a shy, introverted person, most people make me nervous. Visiting a doctor isn't that much different. However, what makes me a bit nervous about visiting a doctor is that I may receive some terrible news regarding my health, such as cancer, or something serious like that.

1	With the doctor I've been using, you just never know what he will come up with. He's friendly at times and other times a real jerk. Also, he divorced his wife and married his nurse. Don't upset the Queen!! 
-1	I really don't just when I know something that I know is wrong as a sharp pain. I just don't like pain or having the worry of having surgery that makes me missing work or any thing like that.... 
1	Not sure what is causing my health problems. As I age, I worry more about serious conditions. Expenses are also a concern.
-1	I don't do well with female exams due to past trauma.  Doc is kind enough to understand why I ask for her to tell me everything she is doing and when going to touch and where.
-1	i might feel anxious or worried if I am waiting on immediate results of something that is very important to me
-1	 When I am sick and don't know what's wrong I guess the anxiety comes from a fear that it could be something very serious that I will have to deal with. 
-1	The only thing that  has ever worried me is having symptoms that doesn't have a clear diagnosis. At that point, the doctor has to guess just like I would. 
1	I always feel Uncomfortable in a doctor's office but I feel lime that is normal it is not always easy hello g a stranger about what is wrong with you
1	who knows, there are so many symptoms that can be said to be related to all kinds of diseases, nobody wants to let some body else tell them that they have diseases
1	That I will have to get shots or blood drawn. Those both make me nervous, or that someone will say something about my physical condition that is negative like I need to lose weight or I will get diabetes or something.
1	I suffer from anxiety n depression.  So to have to explain myself sometimes is difficult enough. My doctor isn't the best so that worries me also. I have Obama care 
-1	
1	I always think something will be wrong. I think they won't take me serious.
1	It has nothing to do with my doctor herself, or her staff. I'm just not a huge fan of sitting in waiting rooms, and I feel like that tends to cause my heart rate to rise and then for me to just get nervous about being there in general. I feel like hospitals and doctor's offices just have a certain smell to them that I'll never fully get used to. My main issue with my health is also having a history of anxiety disorders, so that definitely plays a huge roll in how I feel about doctor's visits. I think that I work myself up thinking about the unknown, and fearing that something will be wrong, even when I'm just having a routing checkup and no reason to believe that something is actually wrong.

1	What they are going to say. What they are going to find. The outlook. The coldness of the doctor. Having to explain things to the doctor. Them not listening. 
1	We never know if our health is improving or getting worse. I'm really worried that doctors will settle for medications that could make me worse off physically. 
-1	Just the uncertainty of the experience. Not knowing if the doctor is going to discover that something is wrong.
-1	If feeling bad and don't know why. When I really don't know what expect from my vist. Also  he looks worried before he tells me whats wrong.
-1	The thing that worries me is not so much what he is telling me as a patient, but what he is not telling me for some reason outside of my best interest. I am definitely worried that he may not be as thourough as he should be, or that his recommendationas could have a negative impact.
1	I feel anxious that the issues I have that I think are probably relatively smaller problems are the result of a larger issue that needs to be taken care of. I worry whenever I go to the doctor that he will find something serious that can negatively impact my life.
1	The possibility that I may have a serious health condition that I may be diagnosed with. I may not have known about this condition and that could be scary.
1	When a doctor no that you are not yourself and want gave you a hard time because they your vulnerable ability and when you are that it is hard to get help because people look at you like you don't deserve nothing because you don't function like normal people if you can't get the medication you need and are being sereve and left with limited tend to make you have trust issues

-1	Finding out what is actually wrong is usually the worst part. Most times there is no issue. I trust my doctor.
-1	I am rarely nervous or worried when I see him. Again this is because I have full confidence in him. The only time I am anxious is if they are going to take blood from me or I will be receiving a injection shot for something. 
-1	Getting blood work because my veins are not good. I hate that I may get stuck 4 or more times in order to get blood done.

1	The unknown. Possibility that they will find something wrong with me that requires medical attention.

-1	I don't usually feel upset with my primary doctor.  when I was having hip problems then was upset as I had to have a hip replacement but loved my doctor and he took care of it
1	I am most worried about the wait being too long. It would be great if they used a ticket system so we do not have to wait, crowded in an area where there might be germs left by sick people.
1	It is the uncertainty that makes me feel very anxious. I don't know what the outcome is going to be and the possible associated costs to treatment also are a cause of concern. I feel that I may be criticized or judged for certain personal choices.

If something very bad is wrong, all of those things I just mentioned will cause even more anxiety, every day without going away for a long time.  I am worried about how this will be perceived by my doctors. I am not this sort of people on a daily basis when I am ""fine"", I am most anxious in the doctors office because when I am there, it is because something is already potentially wrong.

1	Because they are always in a rush and don't listen to what I have to say, this always makes me feel anxious and discouraged about going to see a doctor. My last visit was awful. They sent me to the ER because I was having a hypertensive crisis, and the staff at the ER took blood and sent me home. I didn't even see a doctor. My doctor said she phoned ahead to the ER, but nobody seemed concerned about me when I got there, just sent me to the lab....didn't even do vitals. Doctors suck

1	Whether or not the doctor will listen to me and my companions in regards to my illnesses and current conditions.
-1	The thing that makes me the most anxious when visiting the doctors office is worrying that I won't be taken seriously and won't get the help I need.  I feel like that happens a lot.  Also, I don't like when I have to get undressed and put on one of those hospital gowns for an exam.  I don't think anyone does.  The worst part is when I have to get a pap smear.  The speculum and the actual procedure is pretty painful too.  Another thing that makes me nervous is fear that I'm going to look stupid when I don't understand something exactly.  Also, if the doctor orders tests, that can be no fun although I know it's necessary.
1	I really get nervous about multiple things such as giving blood or other tests that I have not experienced. I can say I am kinda a baby when it comes to tests and such that doctors may do. This may stem from the fact I have not been to the hospital before for anything serious
-1	I do not feel anxious when visiting a doctor because I have studied up on !my condition long before I even got to the door.
-1	I haven't felt anxious or worried about visiting a doctor's office since I was a small child. I don't really enjoy sitting nude with nothing but a paper shirt on, but it doesn't make me anxious or worried. 
-1	I'm anxious when I am really sick and don't know what's wrong with me. I go into the office expecting the worst. It also makes me anxious when she doesn't know what's wrong, and I have to get more testing done. I am also anxious when I have to see another doctor because my doctor is on vacation. 
-1	It's silly, but whether or not I remembered to shave my legs and arm pits! The next thing would be how expensive will the visit be or how much extra testing may cost.
-1	you never know what will come up.  What if an illness is discovered.  No one goes to the doctor because they are feeling good.
1	I have anxiety so going in and talking to the doctor makes me nervous anyway but I get worried about something being wrong.
-1	I do not feel worried about a visit.
-1	I anxious at what he has to say and his answers about what I asked him because always he is open and up to date about my health
-1	I am not anxious all the time, I was thinking more of a particular situation. I was having blood count issues. I had to keep going back for blood draws to see what my counts were at. one of the diagnosis for what i was going though could have been cancer. I was very nervous about getting those results
-1	I am getting older and feel that the whole health-care system is neglecting the elderly when it comes to the best possible care.
1	I worry that I will get a positive test result for a chronic condition. For example, recently my tests showed that I have high cholesterol. 
1	I get anxious or worried because I always expect something bad to come out of the situation.  I'm always thinking something more serious is going on than really is. 
-1	finding out that I have a new medical condition that we can not treat or cure. Having to take more medication on top of what I already take. 
-1	The prospect of pain or experiencing something physically uncomfortable - having a boil lanced, or a skin biopsy taken. 
1	Being judged. Having to get kid. 
-1	I don't like being touched by strangers, particularly in intimate areas of my body.  It is uncomfortable having to remove my clothing, especially for a female nurse or physician's assistant.
-1	I am not really anxious about seeing a doctor because I feel it is better to take care of any problems right away rather than waiting for them to get worse.
-1	I feel most anxious about finding out what is wrong with me and what I will need to do to treat it. I do not like not knowing what is going on with my health.
-1	The thing that makes me anxious and or nervous is just being there period. I habe always been a little nervous when going to the doctor even if I know everything is okay
-1	I Seldom Feel Uneasy About Visiting My Primary Care Physician For Any Reason Whatsoever Anytime I Would Like.
1	I am always anxious going to any public place, my social anxiety affects every single aspect of my life.
-1	I just always feel a little uneasy and nervous waiting on a diagnosis. The feeling of uncertainty is always a bit unsettling. I try my best to not let it bother me to much.
-1	Fear of the unknown prior to my appointment. Usually after seeing the doctor those fears are put to rest.
-1	The unknown of how any results I am waiting on will come out. 
-1	I am worried when the time to know the results of tests. I am worried whether my conditions are getting better, dosages of medicines are right for me in the past three months, when I may proceed for reproduction, ... etc.
1	I am just a generally anxious person, so I would probably be anxious and worried regardless of the situation. 
-1	At the doctors, I feel most worried if when I do not feel listened too.  I have faith in my doctors to monitor my symptoms and take appropriate treatment.  However, when I feel that they are rushed or thinking about other things - it makes me feel uneasy.  Sometimes, I think that doctors are overworked and take on too many patients.  Their offices are revolving doors.  I wonder if all needs are being met or if they are rushing through one patient to get to the next.  Additionally, I wonder what they would perscribe or treat if they did not have to worry about insurance.
-1	whether or not the doctor may find something as a route cause that may be the reason of discomfort or illness. Or how long the wait time will be and if I'll miss my next appointment.
1	Riding with I get home and customer and customer and customer and customer service to you with the wedding is a bit more than the house when I was just calling to be a little late for you to tell bay area of an effort in a bit more than I was on my way home now so I'll have a look at family dollar store for the best ride with me if I'm the one prank calling him to hold on to time with the and customer service to be done a a a little bit a a little more time with the and a a little more than I was going on a little bit a little while a little bit a  little a little more 
-1	Mostly just that the doctor is going to find something really bad.  I am not worried about what the doctor will do or the physical examition itself.  Just the part in the back of your mind that he may diagnose something very bad.  That is what makes me worried and a little uneasy.  Not a whole lot just in the back of my mind.
1	Uncertainty.  Anything can happen. I could be walking out of there and know that I will be dead in a week or I will no nothing more than I did before. 
1	It makes me anxious that they may find something severely wrong with me and it will change my life. Or that they will misdiagnosed something and it will affect my well being. 
-1	I have high blood pressure and at anytime I expect that will effect me in a negative way, despite having it under control with meds, I do still get worried at exams or blood drain. Another is my age. I am over 50, so I know lots of thing a happen at this age range that I should be concerned about. Getting a colonoscopy is one thing I have not done yet, and I should.
1	Don't know what he will find or what tests I will need to take...have had experience where family members died due to not asking lots of questions.
1	I dont want  to talk to strangers about me. Plus I do not follow thier medical advice anyway. I do my herbs/vitamnins/foods and so on.
1	I would feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I am injured and worry an exam may cause more pain or if I feel there is something really unusual about my symptoms and something could be seriously wrong. Regular visits do not cause me concern.
1	I feel most anxious about getting shots because of the pain , and the awkwardness of the situation . I am also worried the doctors may find issues with my health which can be very life changing .
-1	I feel worried that they will find something, mainly cancer, that I have not noticed going on with my body. I worry that they will tell me that I am not healthy for my age. I worry that they will tell me that I need to make changes in my lifestyle. 
1	I just don't like going to the doctors office, I rather take care of my self before I need to go to the doctor. If things are really important then I will go into the doctor
-1	I hate shots. I am an adult and I just hate them. I get queasy and I know it is coming. I worry also about my insurance covering everything due to a medical bill in the past. 
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious when seeing a doctor is which problem I should choose to bring up, as he says I can only bring one up during a visit. So, it causes me a lot of stress trying to figure out which problem is more pressing. I am stressed to go and see him, because I feel like he doesn't care to help me feel better. 
-1	I never know what they are going to say, I get scared I'm going to get bad news or something. it just is unneeded stress
1	I never know if itâs going to go okay. I have a heart condition and sometimes things look great and other times not so great. Itâs stressful and expensive. 
-1	I'm not a worrier and I'm not overly anxious but I think anytime I go to the doctor it's for very good reason - certainly not just a cold. So when I arrive, I am expecting something somewhat serious. Not cancer or some terminal diagnosis but something requiring treatment. 
1	I feel like when I go see my doctor that it's a waste of time because she just throws things at me and doesn't really know what she's talking about. 
-1	Getting needles and worrying about what they may say to me. Also when they call my name to go back to the doctor
1	I feel sometimes worried about the diagnosis, besides that I do not like going to the doctor. I feel insecure but I know it's trustworthy and then I'm with him, it happens to me
-1	When I have a serious condition & I do not know what he will say about my condition so I get anxious & worry a little about what he will say to me & what he will tell me to do to get better.
1	i get scared.I dont want to find out something went back.I dont want to find out something wrong with me that cant be fixed or treated.
1	Mostly I worry about my condition and how it will affect me. I also get nervous around doctors in general, because usually when you have to see a doctor, you won't be getting good news. So I'm usually already feeling a bit anxious before I even see the doctor.
1	If I'm having symptoms or there's been a change in my condition since my last visit, I worry that something's wrong with me. I worry that it could be serious and that it could be expensive. I don't have a lot of money for healthcare.
1	I feel anxious because I know she is always going to find something wrong. If it isn't my thyroid it is something else. I am worried because she always wants to put me on that blood pressure medicine with a diuretic, which made me sick and pass out constantly last time. My doctor is a real piece of work. She doesn't think of the tural approach to things.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when a doctor examines me because I have no reason to worry.
1	The possability for bad news.
-1	I'm most anxious about what the doctor might find.  I worry about possible diagnoses and what they could mean for my future.  
1	I worry about whether I am going to die. I believe if I'd had more money I would have had better care. I do not get to choose my Dr. I have to go where my insurance will be accepted and these Dr.'s are always different. I never see the same one twice. A few years ago everyone had a family Dr. who knew them all their lives. No longer. 
-1	The only thing that I really worry about is that the doctor might find something that is really wrong with me. I might be very sick.
1	What the final outcome will be when I am feeling uncertain about what is going on within my body.  Also, what the response will be tothe medication which might be subscribed.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit my doctor's office due to the face I don't have any major health issues.
-1	Nothing at this point. I am pretty comfortable with going to the doctor and truly have no issues. I get worried that they will give me bad news 
1	when I am setting in the doctors office the longer I set there the more anxious I become especially if I am waiting on some kind of test result
1	i only go to the doctor when im worried about my health therefore when i see him or her it is about something i do not know about my body
-1	I feel anxious if I am having a health issue and worried it could turn out to be something serious.  I make sure I get a thorough explanation when my health issues are being explained to me.
1	Finding out what is actually wrong with me. And just having to tell them all my business. I'm not the most social person.
-1	I am unsure of exactly what the test involves and what the outcome would mean. I am worried about the means to pay for any possible diagnosis' treatment.
-1	I am always worried that something far worse than I have will occur. I tend to think overly regarding what could possibly be wrong. It is usually something pretty common however.
-1	I do not get anxious around doctors.
-1	The only thing that I would feel anxious about is whether the doctor is going to find something wrong with my health.I have minor kidney disease, which worries me slightly, and my mother has diabetes- so I'm uneasy about my a1c readings
1	I'm afraid they will find something else wrong or needs to be taken care of that will cost me more money out of pocket even though we have insurance.
-1	Mostly about pain.  If I know that a shot or some test like bloodwork is required, I do not like it.  It's not enough to make me avoid them but it does add to my slight worry.  
-1	
1	when the doctor tells me I have to have open heart surgay or I have kidneys going bad or I have to have a knee replaced or a hip replaced
-1	I have PTSD and have been nervous talking about it, which is the reason I've most commonly gone to the doctor recently.
-1	
-1	My biggest concern is that I will not be able to describe my symptoms clearly enough, or remember all the relevant bits, in order to convey the full picture to my GP. If I do a good job of explaining my symptoms, then I feel she does a good job of piecing the info together and coming up with options for me.
1	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor is the possibility of finding out something is seriously wrong with me.
1	Nothing makes me feel worried about going to the doctors I'm happy, if there is something wrong I will find out. 
1	I have anxiety about a lot of things. I don't think it's something in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I just do and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what I'm anxious/worried about. 
1	Mainly because I have awful anxiety, I worry about everything so it's in my nature to worry about a million different things.  Also, I've been battling against my weight for a while.  I just never know if my doctor is going to be proud of my progress that I've made since I've last visited or if he's going to be disappointed that I'm not losing weight faster.
-1	That I am going to get a bad news. Sometimes, even when you are careful, you can still be sick. It doesn't always depend on us
-1	My high blood pressure makes me feel most anxious or worried because I know this is a serious condition and I do worry about it. 
1	Just not knowing what exactly is wrong with me is scary. If i go in knowing oh it's just a sore throat or the cold or something isn't that big of a deal. but if i'm going in for a blood test or something like that, it gets a little scary.
1	I am always afraid of them telling me that I have something bad wrong with me and that I am doing to die. Those words are very harsh for anyone to hear.
-1	I am worried that they may find some problem that will require further surgeries and testing. Not that the doctor is unqualified.
-1	I am worried that there will be something that will be expensive. Unfortutely we are in a position where we don't have great insurance coverage and we don't have a lot of savings so a medical issue could be very costly to us. 
-1	They might find major health problems 
1	I don't like that they make you wait so long and when you finally get to see them, after all the other work has been done by nurses, is 5-10 minutes of officious bullshit.
-1	nothing makes me feel this way I'm always happy to see my doctor and all the nurses I always look forward to going
-1	I sometimes worry that something will be found that will come as a shock or a scary diagnosis.  I also worry some kind of testing will need to be done
1	I never liked hospitals or clinics. Those places always made me anxious as a kid and I guess I never got over it. My fear of needles also contributes to that anxiousness. 
1	I am worried that the doctor is going to tell me that I have something seriously wrong. Ever since my dad's cancer diagnosis 4 years ago (and his ensuing death in 2015) I have been close to terrified every time I have to see the doctor. 
1	I'm not sure what I get so anxious or worried about, I just hate doctors offices. From the time I walk in (even if it's just to get a vaccine), my blood pressure elevates. I think that it stems from a time when I had a life threatening condition but I didn't know and went into the appointment thinking it was something simple, but instead I was rushed to the emergency room and spent several days in the hospital. 
1	Getting older brings anxiety with it so I don't like surprises.  As a woman, you can see and feel the changes your body is going through.
-1	Because I have a physician's assistant who is in our family I can usually get a good take on what is wrong with me. However, when something major happens such as the prostate cancer I went through and still must be checked on a periodic basis ... I admit I feel a little anxious and worried before the visit is over. Once I get the all clear signal I am back to normal. I usually do not sweat over it until the day of the visit.
1	 I feel like they won't believe me when I say I am sick, and I'll have to pass some sort of test in order to get a prescription. I worry my copay money will be wasted if they just tell me to go home and wait it out.
-1	I think of the worst possible situations and get worried about being diagnosed with something bad. I am usually able to get those thoughts out of my head though.
-1	That she will find something that is not good or do something that is uncomfortable that I'm not expecting
-1	The woman nurses are attractive and I get excited when they examine me. I don't want to get to excited in the doctors office.
1	Worry that the doctor won't take my complaint seriously. Worry that a serious health problem will present as I get older.
-1	I worry about my doctor's age and how long he is going to remain in practice since he is well aged. I also worry about some of the staff at the office and how many have left over the years. Just general white coat anxiety is what makes me feel most anxious, I have always had that and always will.
-1	Nothing makes me nervous or scared.  My doctor has always had my back whenever a test came back positive I am always relaxed with my doctor
1	There are a few things that seem to make me feel almost anxious or even worried when visiting the doctor's office. One of those things include diseases that can be spread from patient to patient.
1	I never feel anxious when visiting a doctor. The only way that I probably would worry is if they would find something and I would have to undergo some type of treatment 
1	That they'll be lazy and just guess what's wrong with me instead of actually figuring it out. Then prescribing me something I don't need.
-1	The results of tests. I'm always just nervous I might be sick but just not aware of it. Those things worry me and make me anxious when taking test at doctors. Other than that I'm only nervous of needles such as getting shots.
1	I am frightened of blood tests and shots. Also I worry a lot about tests that I get. getting the results back, Going in for a butt test or pap smear and have a bunch of students watch while the Dr. is explaining to them what is going on.
1	The thing I feel anxious and worried about is that I find out that I have a disease or something bad like cancer and HIV or AIDS or that I got a tumor or something that scares me very badly
1	I am anxious because I generally don't like going to the doctor or the dentist. The place often has other sick or injured people there, which makes me anxious. The environment, while clean and sterile makes me uncomfortable. It usually involves annoying paperwork, driving to and from, checking in, and lots of waiting, which makes the experience unpleasant and anxiety inducing. Further, the uncertainty about health conditions or what might be wrong creates nervousness and anxiety.
-1	maybe my car gets stolen while I am waiting for the doctor who is way late in his or her schedule.  that is pretty much the only anxiety or worry I might have 
-1	The only thing I ever feel anxious or worried about is (1) waiting too long for the doctor to appear and (2) worry about whether I going to get a nurse who will do a painless job with the needle!
1	Environment or the feel of the unknown when you are somewhere and you feel at ease and not comfortable.
1	I tend to overthink every little situation. It's not the visit to the doctor's office that worries me or makes me anxious. It's the diagnosis that scares me. Whenever I catch something or develop a cold, my mind always seems to convince me that it's something serious. So, of course, my trips to the doctor have me feeling very anxious until I get a proper diagnosis and realize it's not that bad.
-1	The long wait
1	That I'll actually find myself and that will actually read to do something that I don't actually either want or need; basically that I won't be completely honest with the Dr.
-1	
-1	YOU NEVER CAN BE COMPLETELY SURE THAT AFTER A THOURGH EXAMINATION THAT SOMETHING NEGATIVE MIGHT TURN UP
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting a doctor is the wait time. I get anxious about the price of the bill
1	When a doctor tells me that they are concerned about something and we need to run tests. Then when those tests take forever to come back with the results. That is the worst feeling.
1	When I was pregnant and I had upcoming test like for diabetes, group b strep,and etc. I get worried because I wanted to have a healthy pregnancy.
1	I am always worried something deadly will be wrong with me. I always think they will discover something i missed and it will be too late to fix.
-1	I am never anxious about seeing my doctor he is straight forward and explains everything so no need to worry life is what it is 
-1	I think going to the doctor, in general, gives me a little anxious feeling.  Whether you are going because of a problem or a regular examination, the feeling of wonder about what he/she will say about your health is definitely present.
1	getting bad new about my health, getting a shot
-1	When visiting the doctor, I am most worried that he will find something wrong that I did not already know about.
-1	The unknown variables of health tend to make me feel most anxious and worried. Especially when dealing with critical or chronic conditions, the downsides to health complications can be dire and that is something that I would rather avoid.
1	That they might tell me something is really bad with me or severe and it might be a problem or when they just try to get in my nerves
1	I'm in pretty good health, but my family genes worry me when I go in. I feel as though that coupled with my sometimes bad diet is finally going to catch up to me. That is what worries me when I go in for tests and bloodwork the most right now as I'm getting older.
1	The thing that makes me most anxious is the fear of the unknown. Even if I am at the doctors for something minor routine test can show something worse.
1	I do not ever feel that way when I go to the doctors office.  to me it is a routine thing that is good for me
1	The lack of transparency and uncertainty can be burdensome. Knowing that the doctor knows more about what's wrong with me than I do, and them not sharing all of that information. 
1	That something is seriously wrong or that there is not going to be a clear answer to a problem or a clear resolution. 
1	I can't really explain what makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. I am nervous when I go there no matter what. It doesn't matter if I have a current health issue or not. Getting my blood taken amps up my anxiousness though because I am afraid of needles. I always feel like I'm going to get bad news at the doctor. I think a lot of it has to do with my father and how he ended up dying. He had cardiovascular disease and me and all of my siblings also have some form of it. I lost 3 siblings this past year from heart related issues with no warning signs. 
-1	Usually a doctor's office is cold and this environment causes me to fell tense. Also I often forget to tell the doctor important symptoms and I become anxious when trying to remember them.
-1	That the doctor will find any new problem .Will be able to have a resultant treatment for it.Hopefully insurance will cover it.
1	Either but if something is wrong and don't know what it is. I don't know what will the doctor say.yzx
1	I am worried about something being wrong that would lead to expensive testing and treatments. I also worry about catching the flu from being around sick people in the waiting room.
1	I have longstanding health problems and I'm always worried they are going to say there are signs that they are getting worse. This makes me anxious and worried.
1	I worry about what the result will be because most people go for a visit for something simple and end up with Cancer,..I personally think Cancer is a word that most doctor felt comfortable saying and not wanting to do further research so now everyone have Cancer.
1	I am just uncomfortable being in a doctors office and having them exam you and touch you. When I think there is something wrong with me sometimes I am concerned they are going to think I am crazy, and there isn't anything wrong, or maybe there really will be something wrong. Just being in the doctors office gives you that feeling of what are they going to find.
1	That they will say something they saw in my lab test results was not looking good and it will be bad or not so great news, that they say something is wrong with me
-1	 When i visit the doctor i feel anxious or nervous if i am sick and cannot figure out the cause of it myself.  If there is possibly a more serious problem that makes me anxious. 
1	i  just want too stay healthy  and take care of myself,  I am on my own 59 years old, no family  too help or  ever take care of me,  just myself  so I have too stay well well well
1	More worried just in case doctor told me something worst thing. 
1	I guess just generally I don't want to find out that I'm sick because I don't have any money. I know that hospitals do tend to lower the costs for people with extremely low income like myself, but I'm scared to have to deal with that. 
-1	Worry about negative news about something found or change in lifestyle needed.  And since uninsured, worried about cost of lab, prescription costs.
1	I feel most anxious about some bad news I could get from the doctor's. I am overweight, so I am always worried that I could have a diagnosis related to that.
-1	I usually don't feel nervous or worried when I go to the doctor's office.  The things that make me a little nervous are waiting in the waiting room and wondering which medications I might need if I'm sick.
1	Most of my anxiety is the result of concerns about what my diagnosis might be and whether or not my treatment is effective. One of the chronic illnesses I have can have serious, life-threatening consequences if not treated properly as can the medications I take for it. I am not anxious about the actual physical process of being examined, with the exception of paps smears and mammograms as these are sometimes a painful process. I normally choose female physicians for all of my medical procedures and this the direct result of years of interacting with male doctors, many of who did not seem to understand my efforts to communicate symptoms. It may be me or it may have been them, but the end result is that I am much less anxious in any medical situation when I am attended to by a female doctor.
1	I am worried about what kind of conditions that the doctor might find that I don't know of. I am also worried about things like high blood sugar and type two diabetes. I wonder if the doctor is judging things about my body, like my weight. This is often something I think of, the doctor judging my weight... I feel like I even hold back from going to the doctor because of the feelings of being judged. 
1	Various situations, tasks, experiences and people make me feel anxious from time to time. That's it!
-1	Although I'm seldom there because of sickness, there is always the possibility they'll discover something wrong.  That worry naturally increases with aging.
1	I'm worried about them delivering some kind of bad news like an undetectable virus or something. I also don't like it when they touch me which can't be helped.
-1	I went to a nuroligist a few years back she always acted like I was some kind of retart because I told her God was protecting me from haveing any seizures and she told me she didnt believe that and looked at me like I was Crazy that really bothered me.
-1	That they will come up with something bad and I will need to start another medication. I really don't need to have another medication, I just can't afford anymore.
-1	Having to wake up in the morning worrying about what they may find and having them do blood work which i hate
-1	I only get anxious/worried if I think I could have a serious health problem - and the doctor is giving me feedback on it. It is typically something I am familiar with so I am not that worried.
-1	A little anxiety or worry at the doctor's office arises when (although you try to avoid it) it is revealed that you disagree with what the doctor is suggesting. They tend to become rude or completely unhelpful after that. 
-1	That the doctor may be over looking something or not considering all the available treatments available for my condition.
-1	I feel neither anxious nor worried when visiting the doctor's office. In fact, I feel like the doctors are not going to look hard enough or listen intently enough and under- or misdiagnose me.
1	I have so many illnesses that I know it's always going to be bad news. The fact that I have out off my FNA biopsy for over a year says that. No one wants to know they have cancer. Especially at 26.
1	Having to wait for so long in waiting room. Then having to wait in examition room. My mind wanders and too much free time and quiet is not good when I am at a doctor visit. I don't want to be told anything is wrong with me.
-1	I worry that she will find something wrong that I did not realize was an issue with me. Just the not knowing in general.
1	The possiblity of hearing bad news makes me anxious or nervous. For some reason I always expect the worst news.
-1	Just not knowing what is going to happen.  I always have a hard time when I don't know what to expect.
-1	Well since this is a stupid question, I am not sure how to answer.  I just stated I was not anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office,
1	I am worried that something will be wrong with me or that I will need to undergo expensive treatment. 
-1	I feel most anxious because I never know how the visit may go.  I may think I'm in good health and she may find something unusual.  Not knowing the outcome makes me anxious.
-1	I really don't care much anymore. I am 69, have lived a full life, and I fully expect my health to deteriorate and I am capable of accepting that. The only thing that makes me close to anxious about visiting the doctor are painful shots, but I can handle it. 
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office.  I know that whatever happens or she finds wrong I will be well taken care of.
-1	Unless it's for a regular check-up, I'm at the doctor's office because I''m either injured or ill. My condition would make me a bit anxious. There is also the small chance that the doctor might discover something serious that I was not already aware of. 
-1	Nothing worries or makes me anxious about going to the doctor's office . I am young and healthy so their is nothing for me to eorry about.
1	I feel like they are going to find something wrong with me that I don't want to hear and it will change my life forever 
1	I feel very worried when I receive some bad notice about some parent, and want to know as soon possible some answer from doctor
-1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is really that it's just a one on one meeting with someone that I don't know very well, and that the things we talk about are on a very personal level.
-1	
1	Worried that they won't take me seriously or that they won't really look into the problem and then just throw more medication as a solution. 
1	I feel anxious and also worried about what results will come from the doctors evaluation.  Although I know deep in my mind nothing severe should be wrong I also know there is a chance that something may come back that would make my health even worse than it currently is.  
1	I feel stressed about the possible problem I may have in my health. I feel uncared for and dumb. I feel taken advantage of.
-1	That my disease is getting worse and that I have to go on stronger medication.I also worry about having to be in a wheelchair one day.
-1	I am most anxious that the doctor will find something fatally wrong with me. Though I do not believe it is very likely any time soon, I worry about such a diagnosis happening one day. As someone who has a history with cigarettes and medications, I would not be surprised if I experienced a bad prognosis at some point in time. 
-1	I have no physical or emotional well being issues when I visit my doctor's office. I have complete confidence  in my doctor to give me my physical well being diagnosis.
-1	I think getting a bad dianosis is probably the worst part about going to the doctor and also what keeps me from going to the doctor is that fear that something will not be good
1	I have an anxiety disorder, and it's actually the waiting room that's the biggest issue for me. It's always full of other patients and there are no windows and only one exit. I have one of those faces where I seem approachable, and people always try to talk to me which makes it worse.
-1	Getting in and out! I am disabled and for some reason the office does not have an automatic door. Once in though, I feel quite relaxed. I know my doctor is there to help me in a non-judgmental way and I feel quite safe in his hands. His staff is also very helpful and caring, which makes any visit quite stress free.
-1	I may feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit if I'm going in for test results, other than that I am confident that I'm receiving the care I need.
-1	If there is a problem not knowing how serious the diagnosis will be makes me a little anxious. I also get worried if the doctor writes down more than he talks.
1	Receiving bad or disappointingnews about lab results or tests/x-rays, etc. Also being told I need to be described more medicine on top of what I already take.
1	Past experiences with dotors.  Having to wait alone in a small exam room for an extended period of time.
-1	I'm almost never anxious or worried, but as I get older, there's always the chance that the doctor will find or notice something that I haven't. I'm a good weight for my height, but I don't exercise much, so eventually I'm sure he'll tell me I have high blood pressure or cholesterol, but that hasn't happened yet.
-1	Just waiting in the waiting room and the chances of getting sick because you are at a doctors office make me uneasy but it does not really have to do with the doctor themselves 
-1	nothing really. i generally don't feel anxious about seeing a doctor. I have twice a year check ups and take prescribed medication as directed. I research any serious illness and seek advice or recommendations from friends and family. I do not allow stress to control or rule my life. 
1	Mostly when I feel worried or anxious it's because I'm paranoid that something is wrong with me and I'm about to find out some terrible news.
1	I worry about what the doctor might find. I feel much more at ease once it is over and I am given a clean bill of health. Until then, I get nervous about anything that might be going in my body that I didn't know about. 
-1	Except for routine visits, I go to the physician because of an acute condition. I usually know the best and usual course of treatment because I have researched it prior to the visit. I am anxious because my physician is sometimes blase and doesn't show the concern that I would expect.
-1	I feel most anxious when I have to wait a long time after a blood test or x-ray or similar tests. I also feel very anxious when the doctor seems to be in thoughts when I am sitting in front of him. I am also anxious when what the doctors says is not clear to me or he talks in a very complicated way.
1	Finding out the worst case scenario, even though it is usually very simple treatment. For example going in for a cough and being diagnosed with cancer.
1	 sometimes I get the exoti that they'll be something wrong with me that can't be fixed or I will have to undergo procedures that will take long periods of time and long periods of remission that I just don't have as well as the fact that my health is not always at its best so when I enter the doctor's office I have an exam in fear that they will be something wrong with me that will get in the way of my daily activities as well as separate me from my loved ones
1	That they will discover I have some horrible illness or that I will need some awful treatment. I also just dislike the environment (cold, reeking of disinfectant).
1	I am the most anxious about possibly having to have blood drawn, or anything else with a needle. Additiolly, I am sometimes anxious about the doctor finding something majorly wrong with me. I worry about coming into contact with other sicknesses while at the doctor's office in general. 
1	i just feel anxious in general about doctors sometimes. has nothing to do with them just me in general
-1	I'm concerned about my weight so I'm always a little tense when going to the doctor. I'm uncomfortable saying any more than that.
1	I worry that I won't bring up all relevant health information and we will miss something important. I know a lot of diseases can be asymptomatic, so I am just concerned that small things might actually be related to an underlying issue.
-1	If I am having a procedure that is uncomfortable (such as a pap) I am generally a little bit anxious as it is uncomfortable.  Also, as a cancer survivor I get nervous that I may have a test that sparks cancer screening
-1	Just the unknown. Will I need medication my insurance won't cover. Will my exam give the same results as the last time with no decline
-1	I usually don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office, since I know I am in good hands.If necessary I know the doctor would refer me to someone who would be as caring  and efficient as her.
1	I am worry that my doctor might found something wrong about my health. And I can not handle with the news
-1	Just finding surprises regarding my health. The next thing would be the cost. Though I have insurance, It's hard to see what it covers or not and what I will end up paying.
-1	I do not like people touching me. It is an uncomfortable situation, but I guess sometimes it has to be done.
1	I know that they are there to make money.  I don't want to be another product along the factory line.
1	They're fairly sterile and I generally feel concerned about what possible medical problems I could have.
-1	i dont really feel anxipus when going to the doctor unless its something serious about my health that im fearful of
1	I have a medical condition that can get worse over time.  It could require surgery and this makes me anxious about doctor's visits.  I don't delay making an appointment likely because of my good relationship with the doctor.
1	if i have a problem im worried that it is serious and my blood pressure goes up i get nervous and go to the bathroom al lot
1	That I will get bad news, or that they will not be able to come up with solutions for my health issues.
1	Being examined and evaluated more than anything. Insecurity, if I had to put it another way.
1	I'm afraid it will be a complete waste of my time and money, and they will fail to figure out whats wrong with me or help me try to figure out some solutions.  I'll leave the doctors office poorer and no better off healthwise.  I also don't like it and worry about when it takes them a month or two to schedule mroe advance procedures like go see a neurologist to deal with right now problem.  I pay them copay to have them tell me to go see another doctor...
-1	When I have to discuss my results that do not know about with him
1	I'm anxious and worried about being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes because of my obesity. im also afraid of high blood pressure.
1	Sometimes I go in and I know I get nervous I guess that's everybody my blood pressure goes up since sometimes you know my leg bothers me so that's where it starts at
1	I start imaging the awful diagnosis that he could discover, like cancer. 
1	I cried last time I went because I couldn't handle the stress of him treating me like I'm stupid or asking why I'm gaining so much weight. All he could say was I'm referring you to a phys doctor. 
1	I am worried he will find something medically wrong with me or my illness has no hope of recovery, and I do not like needles
-1	Mainly Iâm concerned about spending too much time in the waiting room around people who have a contagious illness. 
-1	That I might have to get blood drawn which doesn't hurt it's just an annoying process.

-1	I feel shy around strangers or people I don't know well. Additionally, I do not like needles, so the idea of getting blood drawn makes me tense. 
1	Not having a proper conversation that may get to a root.
-1	I'm at an age where I don't want my doctor to find anything wrong with me, but at my age that isn't going to happen. So it becomes, what surprise are you going to spring on me now?
1	I worry they will find something bad.  I don't like to hear negative things about my heath.  I worry I will have to take more medication and I don't react well to medications.
1	i feel it a little bit of anxious or worried and it is due to the uncertainty that i feel that what can happen and imagine the worst case .
1	At age 72, and having a number of health issues, I accept the fact that time is running out for me.  I always feel tense with each medical exam as the likelihood of the onset of a potentially lethal condition would not be surprising at my age.
-1	I worry that I come across as complaining about every little thing. I have a terrible habit of ignoring things for a long time until they become a big problem, and then going to the doctor. I decided I didn't want to do that, but now I feel as if I have been put through a ton of unnecessary testing this year because of my complaints to the doctors, and I worry that I am presenting myself as a hypochondriac
-1	when I go to the doctor I do not fell anxious, I just want the truth, and only the truth. We have Doctor that are truthful because they care for their patient and that want to see them get better.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried about visiting my doctor because I feel as if my health is good. Something that may make me feel worried is the diagnosis he may give me.

1	I hate the dr.  I lost my mother to cancer and am always anxious about whether I will receive bad news 
1	I worry that they might find something else wrong with me. Most times I go to the doctor I end up staying in the hospital  couple days

-1	The doctor finding something else wrong with me; I already have enough medical issues I don't need anymore.
-1	I am fearful that they may find something that is horrible such as a long lasting life changing illness such as cancer

-1	People has to belive the doctor and sometime. They be wrong they only care about the money not the person they put you on pill that all of them has bad side affets
1	The unknown is what I am most anxious or worried about.  What if they find something wrong with me ?  What if they tell me something that I don't want to hear?  I also get anxious when I get on a scale and I have to get weighed when I go to the doctor. 
-1	I am afraid that they WON'T listen to me or treat me like an individual and a real person and will rush through and only give me about 8 minutes of their time and not even ask if I have any questions.
1	Giving blood. I have thin veins so if I don't get a good nurse that can find a vein the first time, it takes a long time and I'm bruises up and I get dizzy.
1	for me the unknown logistical problems I will face for any further treatment.I am in a wheelchair and transportation is limited and many barriers often get in my way.I can't do anything to change the sitation I'm in and just have to deal with it.EX. routine bloodtest took me 3 and 1 half hrs to complete.
1	I don't go to the doctors enough to feel any thing, I'm of the mind set if it ain't broke don't fit it. I guess if I really needed medical service I would use it but I know I must leave this place one day that's a given and I don't plan on spending a lot money on medical I will you go when I go.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried because I trust my doctor completely. She cares about my well being.

1	In the doctors office something that makes me nervous is when my doctor tells me I have to get a shot or whenever she recommends I get a shot 
1	Just the whole idea of not knowing what is going on with your own body. Fearful of family history of diseases.
1	They could misdiagnosis because it could make the situation worst. A large number of the lawsuits come from misdiagnosis and some people have died because of it. 
-1	There is always some anxiousness and worry when going to the doctor so they can see what might be wrong with you........it's not always just the flu or some condition easily diagnosed.
1	The wait time is very unpredictable. I also am always afraid to tell the doctor what I think is wrong because they always argue with me about it
1	My mind always goes to the worst case scenario when I don't feel well or my kids don't feel well.

-1	I am usually anxious or worried of having high cholesterol,high blood pressure or other potential illness that might occur before visiting the doctor's office.

1	What makes me anxious or worried is that every time  go to the doctor is; having to tell him about my same complaints all the time. I don't think they take me seriously. Goes in one ear and comes out the other.
1	I feel worried that the tests will come back with negative results. I worry that I might need to see a specialist.
1	I do not like the doctors office because its always full of sick people. I do not want to make my health worse by compromising it. I also believe that doctors try to push pills on to people and get incentives for it.

1	I'm always worried that something terrible will be found, especially now that I'm getting old. I also worry that something will be misdiagnosed, sending me in a long spiral of unpleasant tests and more appointments that lasts for weeks. Since I don't fully trust doctors, I also don't trust them to cure me if something terrible is wrong.
-1	Having to wait a long time. This is a waste of my life.  Doctors seem to overbook their appointments.

You may regularly experience a rise in blood pressure on visiting the doctor, and fear the doctor will exaggerate its importance. You may be afraid of needles and the sight of blood. If you are claustrophobic, you may fear waiting in a small examination room. If you experience panic attacks, you may fear any situation from which it is inconvenient or difficult to leave quickly, be it a haircut, a shower at the health club, or a visit to the doctor."
-1	I get anxious about my annual physical where he sticks his fingers in places that fingers shouldn't be placed!!
-1	Pap smears.  It's just an awkward situation, though what actually gets me is it can hurt LIKE HELL.  I'm pretty good with pain, it's necessary so I shrug it off, but it's certainly not something I look forwards to in any way, shape, or form.
-1	I worry about the bill and how to pay for it. I have no insurance. This survey is getting too long now 
1	I worry that the medical problem I have will not be an easy problem to fix and I might suffer with alot of pain or might not be treatable
1	That they won't be able to do anything to help me, or just won't know how, or won't believe me that anything is wrong. 
1	Being subjected to tests that I don't want to do (colonscopy) etc., high costs to find out i'm healthy. If I had coverage, great coverage, it wouldn't be so bad
-1	what he might find wrong with me on an exam. Don't know if he will give me a very scary diagnosis about something at at any given time I go in to see see him. ear of the unknown.
1	Sometimes I feel worried about test results, that can bring some unexpected results or  just about  future deeper examinations  - inconvenience or their additional  price tags
-1	If I truly think something is wrong with me, then I am most anxious when she is  giving the physical examition.\
1	I think most of them want something to be wrong with you so you have to come back have test done and they get paid from your insurance company.
1	My kids, my family and my.husband or other people that I care for.  Knowing my test results or going to find out my test results
1	I am always afraid that the doctor will find something very, very wrong. I used to watch a lot of hospital shows, where you go in for a hiccup and you end up dying. I have since stopped watching those and I have been less afraid.
-1	I don't be anxious or worried and just try to have a positive attitude about seeing the doctor because she is easy to talk to about what ever it is.
-1	Nothing at all makes me feel this way upon a scheduled appointment with my primary care physician. She always makes her patients  feel at ease.
1	Honestly for any physical exam it would be getting on the scale. It really sucks because I work really hard on my body and I have been gaining muscle so I know I am going to weigh more, but I don't want to. 
-1	Wondering if there's any new condition or if I am as healthy as I try to be. Hoping nothing comes up that would require a prescription or any medication that I can't remedy myself. I just hope all of my exams have good and positive results meaning good health.
1	just going to the doctor and waiting on them make me worried and then wondering what they may find if doing tests
-1	I hate when a Dr tells me I am obese. I already know what I am and choose to accept it. I don't need or want a Dr telling me I need to lose weight. 
1	i worry about getting weighed when i go to the doctor. i don't want to gain a few pounds and the doctor say something to me about it. i also worry that the doctor will find something wrong with me and then i'll have to deal with a tough situation. another thing i worry about is sweating. i get nervous about seeing the doctor for whatever reason and i get sweaty. that's kind of embarrassing.
1	Worried about any symptoms I have been having and if it might be something serious. I get anxious about blood tests because it is often difficult to draw blood without sticking me multiple times
1	I do not like the smell of the waiting room because it smells like the alcohol wipes. I also do not like waiting when I am just going for a checkup and I have to be around all the other sick people. I also just do not like shots and that makes me the most anxious.
1	The biggest thing that I fear is finding out that I am going to have a serious medical issue.  The longer I have to wait the worse it is.
1	"A lot of them have elitism or an ego about them. I expereinced this several times with doctors. Or while you are sitting there at your lowest point, barely able to hold your head up, they will talk down to you. YES THEY DO. fuck em. Sorry but I can't with medical doctors. There is so much intellectual elitism and yet they haven't actually ""cured"" anyone of diseases because the underlying issue of what everyone is eating isn't addressed. We act like if we can eat it, it's our food source and will go in and out of the body. Unfortutely people forget that in anything, if you burn dirty, or the wrong fuel, you will RUIN the machine/your body."
1	I never know whats about to happen and I hate getting my blood drawn because it hurts most of the time and i have really small veins
-1	I am usually not worried when I visit the doctor's office. I take most things as they come. If I had to think of something that makes me anxious, it's the thought of what the visit to the office might cost me, and how much I will have to pay out of pocket since I don't have insurance. Other than that, I don't get nervous when I go to the doctor.
-1	As I get older, I recognize that my body is aging as well. As the body ages, it tends to degrade. What makes me anxious is if he finds something wrong and wants me to go see other doctors or have tests performed. I don't want to spend the time having to do that.
-1	Your health in general will have you anxious or worried. It will have you depressed or in a bad state of mind.
-1	I am worried that the doctor's office will tell me I'm not trying hard enough to be healthy or belittle me for being overweight. Despite exercise and trying to eat healthy, I cannot lose the baby weight and am worried that at a dr. appt., a nurse or doctor will act condescending because of it.
-1	I mostly want it over as soon as possible.  Of course, I don't want to hear anything negative but I don't particularly feel anxious or worried about anything.
1	I think about how much everything is going to cost.  If you have a sore throat they can somehow make that into about $300 in cost.  The appointment?  $160.  The strep test, another $100.  Like, what the hell man!
1	Due to my experiences of being diagnosed with cancer and surgery that were discovered during doctor's visits
1	Getting a new diagnoses or starting new treatment always sucks.  Waiting for them to come in with lab results is always a worrisome time too, not knowing if things are going the way we scare hoping and the anticipation is scary,
1	I feel anxious & worried sometimes because I don't know what the outcome will be or what they plan on doing with me. I don't like going to the doctors office period. I only go if i have to for example if they give me an appointment. 
1	everything there is not one specific thing and theses minimums are crazy to impose on someone trying to answer these questions
1	I find it most uneasy the thought that they will find something serious wrong with me, and even worse, what this problem will end up costing me, both emotiolly and fincially.  I worry that any treatments will simply be out of my budget.
1	That i would forget why I'm there because I have to write the problems that I have so I can address them when I'm there
1	trying to locate the cause of my health issue. Most often we go to the doctors believing the worst, sometime it is, but most often the problem is reversible or easily treatable. Upon knowing the issue and it can be fixed or cured, causes the worry and fear to disipate.  
1	The overall institutional feel makes me feel uncomfortable. I also do not like sitting by myself in a quiet room for thirty minutes before the doctor comes in, giving me ample time to worry though every possible thing they could say. 
1	That they'll find something seriously wrong with me. I'm always afraid I will have some termil illness.
1	What makes me feel more anxious is the waiting. Waiting to be seen. Waiting for tests only to see the doctor for a few minutes and then that's it.
1	I am afraid they will find something wrong with me!  I do not like them trying to talk me into testing that I do not want.  I used to fuss about my weight and my blood pressure.
-1	Finding out what is wrong with me. Or having him find something new that is devastating. I worry about what the diagnosis might be.
-1	Finding more health problems, to add to the ones I already have. Receiving new prescriptions for medications I can't afford.
-1	I am not anxious or worried about doctor's visit, but concern about time I don't like the waiting
1	I'm not sure what makes me anxious when I go to the doctor, maybe it's the possibility of having to do more tests.
1	The fact that I may need a shot or have an illness makes me feel anxious, in addition to the general atmosphere.
1	There is always sense of anxiety when you go the doctor. You might feel healthy and fine, and then the doctor  might find something. It happened to me a few times, when I went to the doctor. So, there always there sense of uneasiness. Just my 2 cents. 
1	I don't like going to the doctors or for physicians or apartments because I don't want to give them a little bit of blood and I don't like taking all my medications back in with me.... I don't like going to the doctors or for physicians or apartments because I don't want to give them a little bit of blood and I don't like taking all my medications back in with me 
-1	The unknown of what the answer will be. I've had some pretty serious health issues happen and there are chances of reoccurrence. 
1	I always worry about the what if. What if something is wrong what do we do if something is wrong. Sometimes I think too much into something and that just makes me worry.
1	Being told that what I am doing with myself is wrong or that what I've been told to do for a while is actually not good for my overall wellbeing 
-1	When a doctor makes minor indications that something is wrong, it is my natural response to assume the worst even though it is very rarely the case.
1	Of course that something will be wrong health wise or that something will need to be done that I cannot afford. 
-1	Waiting for the doctor to see me while being exposed to possible diseases from the other patients waiting. 
-1	I always want to be in perfect health, so since I see my doctor maybe once a year for a physical and lab testing, i get anxious that something may have come up in the previous 12 months that she will tell me needs to be addressed.
-1	I only sometimes experience slight anxiety. This comes from a general sense that there could be something wrong with my health.
-1	I really hate the wait it always makes me very nervous also needles make sick i really have anxiety issues about being stuck
1	I don't care for doctors or emergency rooms that's what makes me anxious.  I waste my time.  The reason why I get anxious and worried is because of my experience with a majority of doctors, urgent care, and emergency rooms.  I had surgery for a hystertomy, got staph, had 4 doctors visits including urgent care, and ER, went in shock and no one would believe me until a nurse at the ER had tested me after I left the ER.  My GYN said it was pop, my primary doctor completely ignored me after I told her don't look at the paper results look at me, the Urgent care said to take an extra high blood pressure bill, and the ER doctor had me touching my nose with my finger and diagnosed with urinary infection i had no symptoms for.  I suffer to this day and yes I still get hairbrained answers like to go check my eyes for the brain fog.  So that is why I get anxious.  Finally I did get a good learning urologist who performed the other half of my surgery for a urinary band who saw how sick I was and she saved my life from the staph infection after weeks of begging someone to listen that I felt like death.
1	I always worry about hearing bad news. 
1	Misdiagnose me or just scam me into spending more.

1	Just the procedure they have to complete makes me anxious every time I go.  I'm just nervous about the experience even though I've been through it before
1	I'm always treated like an unnecessary burden that they have to rush through dealing with.  I never feel like I can ask what I need to ask.
1	I worry about what may show up in tests. Sometimes I'm unaware of a problem, but the doctor will find something that needs attention and/or treatment.
-1	"Not much actually since my health is pretty good for my age. Only the fact that I'm 74 now and some of my friends are ""dropping like flies,"" makes me wonder when my time will come. But so far, knock wood, I'm doing great! "
1	The thing that makes me mist anxious is needles those sharp little pointy needles that they have makes me anxiety
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I can also relate to what he's saying on a technical level and understand all of the different tests so it is hard to make me feel nervous.
-1	The thing that causes me to feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is not knowing what is wrong before I arrive and the price of a new medication she my prescribe. Medicines prices are so high that sometimes I can not afford to get them, so I have to ask my doctor to prescribe a lower price one so I can get it.
-1	For nothing, a doctor does not make me feel nervous maybe make me feel nervous in the environment where I'm with the doctor

1	I worry about problems I have no control over. I have had problems with my blood pressure in the past and I worry that my blood pressure will be high again. I worry that some other problem that I am unaware of will be noticed. 
-1	Obviously there is always that sense of the unknown. That is to say that any normal routine issue can snowball into something much worse. It's impossible to tell with utmost certainty what is happening within our bodies at any given moment but I suppose that's all the more reason we need to take care of ourselves as best as we can.
1	That the doctor will detect something that could be life threatening at the least. Even if it not life threatening if I was told that I would have to radically alter my life style such as activities or diet I would find it as a great disruption. At least at first.
1	I am worried that I will not understand what the doctor is talking about, especially if something is wrong with me. I am anxious about whether or not the doctor will take me seriously.

1	Hearing bad news like im getting sick again An might have to be hospitalized or even worse hearing that I might need surgery is always nerve wrecking and not good news at all 
1	I am anxious that my health is already ruined. I think about death too much and I am anxious that I am going to die

1	depends on how serious the problems are and the medicine you have to take if you are worried no need to worry if the problem is minor
-1	Hoping that everything is okay. No one should anticipate bad news. Going to the doctors Dosent display how you care for yourself on a regular basis. Anything can happen though
1	I worked in the field for a number of years, but not in a professional capacity. I have some knowledge but math is not my strong suit..
-1	The thing(s) that make me most anxious while visiting the doctors office is the unknown. Sometimes when I am sick and do not understand why, the waiting to find out causes more anxiety than what it is worth.
1	Usually a shot will make me feel anxious or worried. I know I'll most likely be fine, but seeing a needle go into my arm is still somewhat disconcerting. The dentist checking for cavities is also worrying because of the uncertainty.

1	If I go to a doctor then there is definitely something wrong.  I do not regularly go to the doctors but when I do then I worry about how serious it may be.
1	It ultimately depends on what your going to the doctor for. I recently had a baby so every time I went for a check up I was worried that something would be wrong with the baby. I would get anxious that the baby wasn't progressing well and then when it came closer to my due date I was nervous to see if I would go into early labor.
1	With my condition, I have seen alot of doctors. But still am a little nervous going to appointments. Just removing your clothes and having someone poking around. I think it's also the unknown. 
1	I always have a fear in the back of my mind that I may receive life changing news. I have had surgery a couple of times in the past and so I tend to think of the worst case scenario. My worry tends to play tricks on my mind and make any form of pain seem worse than it may be.
-1	I always get somewhat anxious when visiting the doctors because of all the germs and sick people there presently or before me. I always sit furtherest away from people as possible and hand sanitize to restrict the spread of illness as much as possible. As far as the actual visit, it's not that bad it's just the germs and illness I am weary of. 
1	I am more worried about being taken seriously for pain and symptoms I am having even though I have rarely had experiences where they were dismissed. I am also usually worried about the outcome or source of discomfort or symptoms.

-1	I feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor's office when I have to have my blood pressure taken. I can take it at home and it is fine, the minute I get into a doctor's office it gets high. The doctor told me I have white coat syndrome. Always a little concerned whenever they do an EKG. Since I have had a triple bi-pass back in 2004. But it always comes out OK. Get a little anxious when I have to wait too long in the doctor's office. Unfortunately that happens from time to time. But I would rather wait a little long then have the doctor rush through with everyone.
1	A job title, then, serves to define the position and to define the place of its holder, both in the organization and in the community. As a result, its choice demands some serious thought. For the sake of example, let's go through the process of developing a job description for a position that we've decided to call Community Health Educator
-1	I think that there may be some hidden cost and it becomes an unattainable thing for me to get. It could be something worse.

After getting these diagnoses when I least expected them, I just feel like any diagnosis is possible for me.

-1	I am mainly anxious when i visit a dr because I am afraid I am going to have bad news leaving. I am terrified that I am going to be diagnosed with an illness I will not be able to treat or get proper treatment for.
-1	Just the uncertainty of which tests I have to undergo and what shots are going to be given to me.
1	i'm always worried i'll hear the worse. something wrong with me or my health is in jeopardy. doctor's office makes me nervous in general.
1	I am a bit uncomfortable being social in general outside of people I know very well, so I'm usually more worried I am going to make a fool of myself. I also worry that the doctor will be disappointed with the ways I have been handling myself, even though I've never been treated harshly for such a thing. Filly, there is always the small worry of finding out about a debilitating condition that might change my life.
-1	i have no fear or worry when i visit my doctor. i am completely comfortable because it is in GODS hands.
1	Because you never know if they may tell you that it's something wrong with you. This is the reason why many people don't go to the dr's office as much as they should. We hate and fear hearing bad news.  Even just the thought of it makes a person feel at ease almost instantly.

-1	I don't get too anxious but i would probably have to say when they check my blood pressure.
1	I haven't had a male doctor since I was a child.  Now I have a male doctor and I feel very uncomfortable with him.  I think that if I had either a female physician or a male physician who was more concerned and caring I would not have these feelings.
-1	because of my past history, my body is not how a normal healthy person my  age is. It seems like everytime I go to the drs. it seems like something else pops up

That I'm thinking it's something minor but it's something major. I have a bit more anxiousness than others, since I've had the experience where I received unexpected news that I had a serious disease before.
1	I wouldn't want them to find that I had a debilitating disease. No one wants to endure a life threatening disease that would wipe out one's savings and place a strain on family.
-1	When they suggest that I need to do a routine medical procedure that I do not want to be done. I don't like when they say you need something done when you don't have to, it is too pushy to me.
1	I get anxious when I know he's going to take a test and I'm not aware of what will come up eg. blood test. I worry when he takes a cardiogram or sonogram of my heart cause I'm worried that things got worse.

1	What makes me feel anxious or worried is when visiting the doctor office if he/she find some wrong with me at that time.
-1	Drawing my blood when it is needed for lab work. I just do not like getting stuck with needles. I do not like the lab tech searching for a vein into which a needle may be inserted. I just plain do not like seeing a lab tech when I have had to be in a fasting state!
1	I have a stalker and I don't trust due to not knowing who knows him. I don't give out any personal info to avoid being found. 
-1	I feel anxious and worried when I have to go and something is wrong that I can't figure out pretty much by myself because my mother died from multiple myeloma. It was not found until she was stage 4. So I am always anxious whe I have to wait for lab results.

1	Thinking about life threatening heath concerns death being surrounded by sick people putting my fate in someone's hands 
-1	Well it depends basically on whatever is going on in my life at the time as to why I would possibly feel anxious at that time
-1	I know that my physician will want to spend less than 5 minutes with my care and that annoys me. I feel anxious in order to get my most immediate needs out as quickly as possible knowing that he will soon sprint for the door. I do not feel that I am receiving adequate care with him and am looking to change physicians.
1	I guess I am always afraid that something will turn up on a test that I was not anticipating.  There are so many detriments that can lie dormant, and something may turn up even without symptoms.  In some cases, I tend to wonder whether its better to know than not, because then you begin to live as if you have the indientified ailment.
-1	Surgeries make me nervous, but I always have come through them O.K. I have had 13 surgeries, and now I am in the best health of my adult life. I hate the colonoscopies and I am grateful be be old enough not to have pelvic exams any more.
1	That there is going to be something bad wrong with me. Or that if there is something wrong, they won't believe me.
1	I feel anxious when I am at the doctor's office because, even though I am healthy, there is always a chance that a medical problem could be discovered.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried because I'm always positive in everything I do as a person 
1	"I guess there is always the possibility of seeing a doctor for a simple check-up and having them start a sentence with, ""Oh my god, why didn't you have this mole looked at sooner....you have a week to live."" I don't really think that way until I am half-dressed and being examined.  So I would say there is a moment of feeling vulnerable in that situation, but I don't obsess or anything."
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. I love going to the doctor's office and love interacting with the medical team. 
-1	nothing i know my body and the health care system as well as my doctor so there is nothing to be anxious about

-1	I mainly worry when I am not certain about what is going on with my body. What is causing issues of illness.

-1	I don't feel much anxiety when I'm at the doctor's office.
-1	I'm just worried they'll tell me I have some deadly disease or condition I never knew I had that they can't cure or know about.
1	What makes me feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is getting the results back from lab work. I am not the most healthy person so I am somewhat worried that I may have some illness that is undetectable that can be found in blood work or x-rays. I dread the idea that I may have some kind of serious illness and that it will affect my life significantly. 
-1	I felt this way becausr or seemed like the doctor didnt take the time to hear all of my symptoms and he uses a computer to give him a diagnosis for whats going on with me
-1	The most nerve-wracking part of visiting the doctor's office is the potential that something serious is wrong; but, otherwise, I do not experience a strong anxiety about actually seeing the doctor. 
-1	"I guess I fear that they will ""find"" a problem with me that I may not have even imagined. This is why I avoid the Doc unless necessary. That being said, I have arranged to have my 1st physical in 8 years as I am getting older and should check things out."
-1	Because I'm afraid that they find me something bad or have to put some strong treatment that can alter the normal rhythm of my life
1	There usually isn't anything specific. I just have pretty terrible anxiety and just having to leave the house makes my chest tense. But there's also the fear that things could have taken a turn for the worse 
-1	that i cant afford it or im going to have something keeping me off work too long. the wait also makes me anxious.
1	I really don't like going to the doctor unless needed.  I try to keep healthy so that my visits to the doctor are rare.   It's just the way that I am.  No particular reason, I'm just that way.
-1	I am worried that the diagnosis will be worse than I initially thought. Although unlikely and Im not a hypochondriac, still, a small part of me feels very anxious about a bad diagnosis.

-1	I feel like I might have a life threatening illness and may not find out about it until it's too late. I also fear that the doctor may not find out about it or even tell me if they do find out. 
1	Finding out some kind of terrible news. Chronic disease. Expensive procedures are also a big fear. It's not a big issue because I stay healthy
-1	I am not. My doctor makes me perfectly comfortable as I know he has my interest at heart. He prescribes medicine minimally. 
1	I often have to have physical examitions and blood tests.  The blood tests especially incite dread, anxiety, etc in me simply because I know they will hurt.  Even the physicals give me discomfort though.  I also worry about what thing I will have to correct my doctor on this time.
-1	I usually do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I only got bored if I need to wait too long.
1	I think the feeling of finding something seriously wrong. I've been lucky to not have very many medical problems in life so I only have to go to the doctor for something minor. It's not a familiar place so that makes for some anxious feelings overall. 
1	That they'll think I'm lying about how I feel and that they'll  just think I want drugs even though I really just want a doctor to be receptive to my needs
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worry when I visited my doctor office. I am totally comfortable in her space.
-1	Social anxiety is one of those things that you have to keep facing, over and over, no matter how scary it is. If you let it take over, it'll get too hard to even leave your house. I was terrified to get help, too. It took weeks before I finally gathered up the courage to make the call. I arrived for my appointment early so I could have time to sit in the car and compose myself before I went in. Once I was in the doctor's office, I shook so much that I could barely grip a pen. My voice came out in rapid little bursts, and I was drenched in sweat.
1	The idea that I would be told something that is not completely true and will end up costing me more because of false information.
1	I feel that going to the doctor is unpredictable. I'm sure they're doing their job but you never know what kind of news they have for you. It's hard to prepare for what they're doing to tell you. 
1	That they will say something that is not what I wanted to hear. Also that they might now really look into what is going on.
1	I feel most anixous about being touch and in a place where frequent sick people seat. Being in a place geeked with germs makes me nervous
1	I don't like people and I feel like people judge me I know it's all in my head and they probably aren't even paying any attention to me but it's the what if
1	I get nervous during doctors examination because I worry about whether or not something is wrong with me. It's been this way since I was a kid I have hated going to the doctors

-1	I tend to be relaxed when visiting the doctor's office, unless dealing with a unique situation that may carry anxiety with it - ie illness, new physical sympton etc.
1	I get very nervous about hearing bad news. That I am dying, or that my blood pressure is too high. I have always been afraid of doctors.
1	I am always anxious that there will be bad result or bad news.  I also am a little uncertain that the doctor is taking my actual thoughts or words into consideration. I know that he actually went to medical school but I live with me and know how I feel and what I am experiencing and to have a doctor disregard and dismiss my thoughts is upsetting.  I also do not like going to doctors I do not know who fill in because of bad experiences with rude doctors.
-1	I am usually not worried or anxious about visiting the doctor's office because I'm generally healthy most of the time.
-1	my weight, I have tried to lower my weight and get down to a certain size, although I have lost, I still have a way to go also I always want to see my blood pressure lower, another thing that I have been working on
-1	I feel most anxious  when I first go to the back to get seen and I feel worried when its time for blood work
1	I become concerned that my doctor may find someone wrong with me that I can not financially afford to take care of
-1	Whether I need to be here.  Whether they can help me.  Whether this is a good value for my money.
-1	When I have something that needs to be diagnosed, I worry it might be something worse than it is.  The tests required for diagnosis do not always come back right away, there is a waiting period for results.
-1	That I will need to have shots or I will hear the word cancer. I do not mind the exam and any drugs or other things I would need to do.
-1	I'm more worried about the cost than anything else. I'm very healthy, but I'm afraid of the high cost of falling ill and having any medical issue. That's what concerns me the most 
-1	I am worried that the doctor might find a problem that has persisted for a while but has been unknown to me because there were no symptoms. I worry that the problem could be expensive to treat, or that it might be debilitating. I am not worried about talking to the doctor. In fact, I'd rather know about a problem sooner than later.
1	I am not a social person, so I have some difficulty speaking about my problems and issues. I am also worried about what the doctor may have to say about my health. 
-1	Nothing. I do not have any serious conditions and mostly go for routine visits. I am a strong believer in preventative medicine
1	I dont like to find out my co pay since it changes so much for where I go. I don't really understand why it does but it's not the insurance I use since I was told everyone no matter what get the same charge depending on what they are going there for
1	The one thing that makes me anxious is not knowing if there may be some things or issues I might have that I am not aware of. 
1	I feel most anxious about what they may tell me or if I have to take off my clothes. 
1	I feel a little anxious about doctor visits in general. The clinical setting makes me feel a little uncomfortable and it usually ends up being a source of work for myself later in order to continue my healthcare. 
1	As I'm someone who doesn't see a dr very often, I feel I would be judged for not coming in regularly, no matter the reason I was there for that particular visit. 
-1	I'm feel anxious or worried about any health issues that may be life threatening. I am sometimes worried that some procedures or tests may not be covered by my insurance.
-1	I am NOT anxious or worried when going to the doctor!  I do not know why this applies to me. I did not put that in my questionnaire.
-1	I have taken his convictions and applying them to myself.when we talk he makes me at ease so we can have a true conversation.he fusses at me when I'm doing something that I shouldn't
1	That they'll find something really wrong.
1	 You never know what they are going to find that is wrong. A serious medical condition may be what they are going to tell you.
-1	When he has s to run test and im not sure what the results are. When I have to get shots or transfusion
1	I don't like being picked at by strangers, I want to keep my body private to myself, not to a doctor
-1	Just having to see the Doctor is enough to make anyone, me a little anxious. Fortunately for me, I have always gotten good news, everything is and has been fine. There is always that chance that some day I could get some not so good news. 
1	I'm worried that they will say something about my weight or blood pressure or that I'll have a negative result when I go. I know that I don't have the healthiest exercise or eating or drinking routine and I'm sure that it'll catch up to me at some point. So, the concern is that it catches up to me when I'm at the doctors and I get awful news.
1	Most things make me anxious, so it is not necessarily a special occasion. I do not do well with uncertainty, so if it something beyond a checkup or the like, enter: anxiety.
-1	Scared I would leave hearing bad news. Going to the doctor and not knowing if I'm going to walk out with a condition I didn't walk in with
1	i feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office allways.I feel good and allways worried
-1	When I have a gynecological or sensitive problem that I feel embarrassed about. I'm getting to be less worried about that but especially when I was young that was a main area of discomfort.
-1	I feel like they might found something bad. I also think that I may have a bad condition.
-1	
-1	I just get nervous that something could be wrong with me that I am unaware of.  Also getting tests done makes me nervous of the outcome
1	Bad news. That is all that needs to be said. There may be things that are wrong with you and you may find out on that visit. You could have cancer, you could have lupus- there are thousands of potential scerios that will start to unfold after that visit and its only human to be scared of those potential outcomes.
1	For one thing having an appointment at a certain time and then having to wait and wait.  Then when you finally see the doctor he spends very little time with you.  I get anxious about the outcome of my visit and what he will find.  My blood tends to rise a bit in this instance.
-1	Waiting on the dr to arrive in the room and then not knowing what the outcome will be of your symptoms.  Also can get nervous when waiting on him to provide you with test results.  It's an uneasy feeling.
1	The fact that they make assumptions and don't listen to me. I've witnessed them giving incorrect information to other people and I'm always annoyed that they will do the same to me. So just based off of previous encounters, I dread that. 
1	Going in for one thing and they find something else wring with you. I dread having to take a lot of medicine 
1	I have what is known as a fear of needles.  Not too excited to be at a Dr's office.  I have had to go to so many because of my allergies and asthma.  Always glad when the appointment is over. 
1	Having had a past infection makes me worried that something might still remain. Also, having lost a baby a few days after work makes me feel worried about both my health and my current pregnancy. 
1	Uncertainty is the key to promote anxiety in my opinion. During the visit, I am worried when I meet with the PCP to discuss the outcome of the examination. The main reason is the uncertainty about the result. What if something really bad happens? What is my current health condition? I cannot control my feeling in the uncertain condition.
-1	Depending on if I am having any problems when I go to see the doctor, I do get concerned if he recommends some sort of test.  Its the waiting for the outcome of the tests that get me worried more than the actual doctor visit.
-1	I get anxious going to the doctor's office mainly because of any uncertainty as to what is wrong, plus the doctor's office itself makes me anxious, just the smell.
-1	The only that makes me anxious about the dr.'s office or hospital is needles i am not a fan of them . But other then that I have no reason to be anxious or worried when I visit them .
1	I don't want to hear any awful news and find out that something is terribly wrong with me. I feel scared that something might sneak up on me health-wise and it can be catastrophic.
1	There is always the thought that the problem could be something worse than expected. Also I feel anxious that the problem will be something that cannot be fixed or something that will take a long time to recover from. 
-1	What might be found out, what could be wrong with me.  Especially when going in with a new medical problem, something I haven't really experienced before.
-1	Being diagnosed with a long existing condition or having to have surgery. I hate feeling like I'm ill
-1	Tell me if I have a promble or something not right or have something or There any big things in my body that's not working right and give me some Answer about my body I need too know.
1	I might get information I don't like about a medical condition. I might have to have an awkward conversation with the doctor. The doctor may have to examine me, and an unfamiliar person doing that is not the most comfortable situation. 
-1	Sometimes when I go to the doctors office and it is something more serious my mind often goes to the worst case scenario and how my life would be impacted if something is really wrong with my health. I worry that it might be some difficult procedure needed to make me well again.  
-1	"Not much.  I don't like giving blood samples, so that would be the biggest ""fear"" or cause for anxiety.  The other one is the prostate exam."
1	I am always worried that the doctor will find something really wrong and that there will not be anything he can do for me.  
1	I had a abnormal lab result a few visits ago. This worried me very much because this could mean cancer. My doctor attempted to ease my nerves, but when you think cancer you think death. 
1	I just hate going to the doctors office and see what may be going wrong with my health. But I know that I have to go
1	Just the notion that a test result could reveal something bad.  Cancer, for instance. 
-1	i never feel anxious i am always calm cool and collected problems dont bother me i just push forward and solve trhem as they arise
-1	I am not nervous or anxious when visiting the doctor. I am rarely sick. If I felt that there was something wrong I may be anxious but not at this point. 
-1	Possible hearing something unexpected regarding my health and severity that might be as far as long term care
1	I guess the uncertainty of your health is what makes me the most anxious. It really worries me that I don't truly know if I'm fully health even If I feel healthy.
-1	
1	When I hear order or someone tells me about any type of disease or illness and their symptoms I usually can say that I have those exact same symptoms therefore I must have that illness or disease !!!
-1	Needles needles and more needles I do not like the feeling. I do not looking at one it makes me crunches
-1	It depends on the reason that I am visiting , whwn my blood pressure was out of control i was extremely anxious/worried
1	I am scared they will find something that is termil. My father passed away from cancer when I was very young, and I get extremely anxious that I will get blindsided with something terrible. 
-1	Finding an illness or disease I was not aware of would make me very anxious & worried as to what will happen next.
1	I'm embarrassed of myself and how I let myself go and I'm fearful of negative diagnosis and worried I can't comply

1	When you going in blood work the needles sometimes hurt you and finding your weight up and down by stressing out.
1	i am anxious to talk about what is going on with me and im anxious to find out if something new is wrong with me
1	I do not want to hear any bad are problems about my health. I only won't to hear great news about my health period.
-1	Anything can go wrong at any time. I'm in good health, but you never know. There is always this little bit of anxiousness that something could be wrong or something in the future. 
1	When you go to them about your pains. Once that see that something else is wrong there is two or more  prescription.
-1	Nothing in particular, although at my age you never know when a problem will be discovered. I did have cancer 25 years ago so it's likely to not return at this point, but certainly not unheard of.
-1	I believe that the only thing that would make me a little anxious would be the wait time once back into the room. However, that wait time has decreased tremendously with the current primary physician 
1	I'm worried about getting bad news. Usually when I'm at the doctor, something is wrong with my health.
1	Unless I am visiting for a routine checkup the odds that I am visiting a doctor is because something is not right and therefore I am anxious and worried about the visit. 
1	I feel anxious because of not knowing what the doctor or physician will tell you good or bad. It's like waiting for a teacher to grade a huge paper and finally getting your results good or bad 
1	Hearing bad news is what makes me feel most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office because you never know.
1	The unknown is what make me so uneasy and nervous about going to the doctor and waiting for lab results
-1	It depends why I'm going to the doctor but since I rarely go, when I'm there I'm always hoping it's nothing too serious so I get a little carried away with bad thoughts 
1	What would make me feel most anxious is taking test, removing my clothing, getting shots or being told that I have a disease. Most doctors office visits are stressful for me because I have chronic anxiety, however, sometimes I am able to calm myself down during the office visit. I do worry about germs of other people as well, and worry later if I could get sick from them. I usually rush home and shower. 
1	if there is something serious wrong with me i want to know about it. i worry alot and high anxiety. i stress 
1	I have an innate fear of going to the doctor. For no apparent reason either. It is the fear of what the doctor would say, and finding something wrong with me. There is also the aspect where I would have to do things that are uncomfortable to myself, such as things that should stay private. On top of that, it is seeing the bill afterwards and paying it. 
-1	I generally do not get too worried or anxious about anything.  What is, is.  If a problem reveals itself, I will tackle it head on.  Worrying gets you nowhere.
-1	Advising me about future examinations such as pap tests which I don't like  I Have no issues at this stage of my life and really don't feel I need this procedure/
1	I feel anxious during the times I see my doctor if he or she is about to review lab results and is about to let me know what everything means.
-1	The only thing I can think of is the Dr wanting me to take meds to get my cholesterol down but they cause my anxiety to go through the roof so I stopped taking them. It causes me stress because I know the Dr will get on to me every tie he tests my cholesterol. There has to be a quality of life taken into consideration and if I have to be bouncing off the walls and living feeling so much anxiety I cannot function, then I will deal with having high cholesterol.
1	if there for test results the unknowing can be worrisome until you find out normal results..so it can be concerning.
-1	Probably the possibility of outcomes. I'm always nervous that the problems I'm there for will be something more serious. 
1	I have not been anxious from going to a doctors office in a while.  Everything that I have been told in a while was what I was expecting.

1	I anxious about get my results . And I worried about have some deadly sickness and they is no cure for it 
1	That they will find something wrong, that my lab numbers won't be as good as they should be, that I will have gained weight, etc. 
-1	My worries at the doctor are usually less about the actual meeting with the doctor than surrounding matters like cost and health insurance. I am sometimes concerned about prescription side effects or misdiagnosis, but am willing enough to accept my doctor's recommendations that it doesn't bother me.
1	It's just the uncertainty. I don't know what they're going to do or say and I don't necessarily trust that they'll make the right decision. As such I just feel a general nervousness and uncertainty when going in.
-1	if they come up with a problem telling me something is wrong and i dont know how to take what is being said 
1	The fact that anything could come up our happen Things that have you have no control over and that things could happen out of the blue no matter how much you try and prevent it
1	they check me and ask me a lot of persol questions
-1	But doctors can make a different kind of mistake. What I found strange when I first started running the health anxiety clinics was how many patients had been told they had a fatal disease when they did not!  Rather than making the mistake that everyone worries a doctor might make, namely missing the diagnosis of a deadly disease, their doctors worried them unnecessarily by diagnosing deadly diseases that were not present. That happened to me once. I had a swollen leg. Being a health worrier myself at that time, I had already made sure by repeatedly testing myself that I did not have the fatal kidney disease the doctor, when I finally got around to visiting him, informed me blithely that I had. I was able to dismiss his opinion out of hand.  But I have had patients who forever after worried about the disease they were told they had.
-1	Nothing really, I've not had a bad or surprising experience with a physician. The only thing I would worry about is how long is the visit going to take!
1	The news could be get or bad,And what kind of disnois i might get,or the type of medicines be prescibed.
-1	To have to doctor tell me something serious like I have cancer or HIV is scary because that means I'll be dead sooon
-1	When we have to talk about surgery. I worry about the outcome. But then she puts me at ease and tells me exactly what is going to happen and that I have  the best doctor working on my problem. Most of the time she sends me to a doctor she has used herself 
1	There is always fear that the Doctor might bring news of terminal illness that might be afflicted with. So that fear of bad news is what make me anxious and worried.
1	Taking medication  don't know  about . It worst case for me. I don't like dr not honest at all. They wrong information 
-1	I absolutely hate going to the doctor.  I hate the way the office smells and have since I was a child.
1	If I visit a doctor's office, I'm worried about several things. I worry that something is wrong with me and it's going to be worse than I imagined. I also worry that I will be misdiagnosed, and I also worry about what the doctor or his nurses think of me, particularly if I have to disrobe during the examition.
1	I always feel like the doctor is going to look at me weird or find something that is wrong that I wasn't aware of.  
-1	That I may or may not have a serious health confliction and in having one my doctor will look down on me and judge me. I am also afraid about how much everything will cost me in the end
-1	I would say that I feel most anxious when the doctor's facial expression says something before they even tell me.  if the doctor looks discouraged about test results I usually become anxious or worried.
-1	I don't feel worried about the doctor because I feel the worst is over now ill get some medicine to feel better
1	That the doctor will be rude or one of the nurses will be rude. Im a little on the heavier side, and they have to weigh me every visit and its really frustrrating. I know its so they can keep me on track of weight and stuff but its really embarrassing stepping on the scale and every time i gain weight.
1	Worried that something might be very wrong or require surgery or an invasive procedure. I am very afraid of needles.
1	I feel anxious and/or worried when I am waiting in a crowded office waiting for my turn to see the doctor and then I feel the same way when I am waiting in the exam room for him to come in. I am anxious ans worried about what he will find is wrong withme
-1	The feedback that I will get I fear will not be a joyful one. And also going to the doctors is scary because one moment you think you are fine and you go see the doctor and they have found something scary.
-1	This is tough since I am so comfortable going to the doctor.  I am only anxious or worried if the result keeps me out of work for any period of time.  The office is clean and cheery.  The office staff is always friendly.  I know everyone by name.  The cost of a visit has gone up dramatically so I suppose that makes me anxious.  I do worry that I might not be able to afford prescriptions since they also have gone up.  It seems like my paycheck is going for a higher rate of medical things.  I stopped buying anything that isn't an absolute necessity.
1	"I feel as if I will not get the answers that I want and need. I want to be told the truth and not have it ""sugar coated""."
-1	I worry the doctor will find a serious issue that I had not expected and is life threatening. It makes me anxious to think there might be symptoms I overlooked that signal a profound problem.
1	It is the waiting and wondering if they will take the time or just throw a prescription at me.
-1	That I might catch an illness from someone else that is there at the time. Or that I may end up needing to get tests or blood work performed.
-1	Anticipation of receiving possible negative news.  No one wants to hear anything negative at the doctor's office.
1	Because i dont know what they r going to tell me and i dont like geting lied to from nobody not even my family
1	Not knowing what the outcome will be.  I also dread the types of tests that may be ordered.  Some tests are more upsetting than others and doctors do not always do a good job of what they are using them for.
1	I worry about the length of time I might have to wait until the doctor is ready to see me.  Then I worry about is there something else wrong with me.
-1	I am getting to an age where cancer becomes more prevalent and also because of family history. I am certain that i will receive the proper care and support from my health care provider and family, but it is still an unknown concern.
1	Their job is to diagnose an illness to a patient. Many patients are misdiagnosed. I don't want them to say something is wrong. I know my body. 
1	I feel most anxious about hearing some bad news or told that I only have a certain amount of time to live 
-1	Sometimes if I have a questions I feel it is or could be a serious condition, I do feel anxious and worried at times.  I think I get anxious and worried because I have been thinking about my questions for too long.
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office when I know my health is not good.  I feel the knowledge that I have about health nutrition can be worrisome when I find myself at a doctorâs office.  I do sometimes get anxious because I was either unaware of my mental condition or physical condition during my visits.  I felt that my physical health was in good standing, but then I take a visit to the doctorâs office, and I am told that I still need to fix my high blood pressure and cholesterol.  Not all visits are worrisome, its just keeping on track with what my doctorâs tells me to do until the next visit.    
1	Since I don't have a primary physician I have been letting my health kind of take  care of itself.  I would like to find a doctor but for some reason it's not very high on my list of things to do
1	"I get nervous by the ""formality"" of the setting. Sometimes the setting is too clinical and not very personable. I worry about these things and not about the outcome of the visit."
1	What makes me feel most anxious is that the doctor will start telling me that some of my symptoms are all in my head or that the doctor will decide that he wants to try some new treatment.  I am very drug sensitive and don't do well when I have to take a new drug.  I have had way too many bad reactions to medications, so now I have anxiety over any new medication I try.
1	o get anxious in the dr office if its a new problem and i dont know what it is or if i have to see a new dr
1	There is always a chance that the doctor might find something wrong for example, a tumor or cancer. I also hate needles and being weighed on a scale.
-1	I only feel worried when I'm being tested for possible serious health problems. I'm worried that my doctor might find something serious.
-1	It's awkward and uncomfortable.
-1	I am  usually not worried about going to a Drs appt. I have had the same dr for almost 7 years, my other two I have have been just great too.
-1	Her talking over me and not actually listening to my problems. She would just listen to part of the symptoms or issues I have and explain that I am too young to be diagnosed with anything so she gives me at home remedies to see if the problem stops or persists.
1	I feel anxious about going to the doctor at any time.  I am not a fan.  I can become a little worried about the idea of tests or anything out of the ordiry.

1	when they stop the convo and you start to think something is wrong with you, or you scared of your weight or blood pressure.
-1	"I'm turning 40 this year, so I do get a little anxious these days when I go to the doctor. There's always a little ""what if he finds something"" voice in the back of my head, even though I'm quite healthy overall. I don't really mind going all that much, though."
-1	I have anxiety just being in medical buildings not because of the doctor herself. I also often feel worried when being examined that something wrong will be found.
-1	i am never really nervious about going to the doctor i just want to get it over with and get out of there
-1	I worry that my doctor might tell something bad about my health.
-1	I worry that they may try to push a drug on me that will end up hurting me or ruining my life. Of course, I'm very resistant to that and I would reject anything that I couldn't research before I took it. I just feel like I have to keep my guard up and make sure that I'm doing what's right for me in my understanding of things, regardless of what the doctor wants. 
-1	I think there's always that worry in the back of your head that there may be something really wrong with you and the doctor is about to find it and tell you.

1	I'm worried about the readings of my vitals that the nurse takes. Those are generally the best way to tell how I'm doing. By the time the doctor comes in, I'm more apprehensive at what the numbers are more than I'm worried about him as a person or physician. 
1	not being able to properly explain my condition and not receiving adequate treatment
-1	its usally a long wait when I go to the doctors the waiting makes me anxious and when I have to wait to get results makes me feel worried some times.
-1	I am usually very calm and do not feel anxious as I do not have any major problems to be worried about.
1	Not knowing how my numbers are going to look is a big concern for me.  I try to eat healthy, but I have to admit, I fall down  quite a lot.  I have hypertension and eating right has a lot to do with keeping that in  tact. Then there's my weight which seems to have a mind of it's own.

-1	Just hearing some bad news but I know they are just doing their job at the end of the day, so whatever they do is understandable.

They sit their and run their tests, sometimes not talking very much, so you can only sit there and think that something is seriously wrong with you. I always fear for the worst, every single time. Be a use in most cases people usually get the worst news of their lives, from their doctors.
1	Never know what to expect and I do not like strangers touching me.  I find the whole process invasive.
-1	I am worried that I will receive some bad news or that my doctor will ask me to undergo more testing or strange therapies.
-1	The thing that makes me most anxious is simply being weighed. I hate that part because it is always extremely awkward with the nurses. Other than that I do not get extremely anxious.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office; I trust my doctor completely
1	I am afraid I'll have some horrible disease or find out that my doctor cannot help me in a way that will improve my well being. It feels tense because I don't know what to expect and am also afraid of being judged.
1	The fear of judgment from the examiner in regards to my obesity, I know every time I go I am going to get a lecture about loosing weight. 
-1	I usually don't feel much anxious when visiting the doctor's office. Maybe because I used to visit the doctor's office when I was a child. The past experiences sometimes may make me a little anxious.
1	Just going to a doctors office makes me a little anxious. I have some anxiety issues so when doing something or going somewhere new I get nervous. I would also be a little worried that any issues I have would be passed off as just anxiety symptoms.
-1	It's not a remark on my confidence in my doctor; it's more of the fact that I'm worried that I have some underlying condition that is more serious than I anticipated.
-1	I would say that if something is ailing me.  I do not want a bad prognosis.  The physician, I am not anxious or nervous to see.
-1	The only thing that would make me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the prospect of possibly having blood drawn, getting an injection, or having to have a surgery or other procedure scheduled. 
1	Just the worry of what the doctor says the condition coudl be. I'm also always too nervous to ask many questions.
-1	In good general health. Not expecting any surprises. Mostly go for routine annual checkups.
-1	Mostly after blood work up, you never know the out come of lab work, so i get somewhat a little worried until i get the good news.
1	I worry that the doctor will find something that is wrong and needs to be treated but the cost of medical care is so expensive that I will not be able to afford treatment.
1	I think it is usually the possibility of illness or a bad visit and finding out something is wrong.
-1	I'm a cancer survivor, so I always worry that something seriously wrong will be found. Certain exams are more uncomfortable than others. Sometimes, I feel anxious about possible pain.
1	Just the feeling that I get when I walk in the door it's just a worried feeling like something going to happen to me or the people in the waiting room and it's always to quiet all the time 
1	The whole think.  The waiting, the gowns, the sterile environment.  It makes me very anxious.
1	The thing that make me anxious is driving. I feel worried about what doctor The will say about my waiy
1	I don't like making a copay and wondering what else I will be charged for.  I'm usually worried that some test will come back bad.
-1	the only reason I would fell  anxious and or worried about seening my dr. would be that the  out come would not good for me
-1	I would feel anxious not knowing the outcome of the visit. It would scare me to find out that I have a problem with my health.
1	I am worried that I wont be heard or listened to. I have had experiences where I have been told that the issue I have will go away with time and sometimes it hasn't. I try to ask questions, only to be passed off to someone else and I have to explain things all over again.
-1	I'm worried that I might be pregnant once again or they may find something that I didn't know about. But it's a little worry. Nothing, crazy.  
-1	If I'm undergoing a procedure that could have bad results, that makes me anxious. Also, if I have to wait a long time.
1	The wait time can make anxious and worried about the care that might be given to a patient because of a doctor's work load.

1	About what they going to say about my health or I'm eating to much because I'm gaining alot of weight because of my height and I just get worried alot 
1	Just being in any medical facility makes me uneasy. I  do not like being in the doctors office at any time.
1	I get worried about cost of visit and needed things after. I also get anxious thinking they will have nothing but bad news for me.
1	I feel like my doctor is judging my body. I feel like I am inferior because I am not in good health and have many problems compared to my doctor.
1	I'm worried that he is going to give me a difficult diagnosis and if I don't have someone there with me? Like a close friend or family member? I'm not sure how I would handle the situation because No one likes to be alone when bad news is delivered.
-1	That I'm told there is something wrong with me then I will feel anxious.  I just hope there is no bad news whenever I go to the doctor.  Hoping not to hear anything but good news that all is well or will get better. 
1	I have social anxiety so i have difficulty communicating at times. Having someone ask me personal questions or see me in a vulnerable position can make me feel uneasy. 
-1	That something might actually be wrong makes me feel anxious, but what makes me feel even worse is if I go in with a problem that turns out to be nothing.
1	I'm afraid they will find something else wrong with me even if I just go in for a check up. I just get anxious I'll get news that something isn't right
-1	The feeling that they will judge me for my life choices, even if I strongly believe they are the right choices for me. I don't tend to do things willy nilly. I try and do my research and make sure I have informed opinion or choice in something I personally participate in. I don't always eat right, and even if I eat bad once a  month, I would feel like I need to justify my decisions to my doctor. I also have a general sense of anxiety, so any unknown situation will make me worries, usually for no good reason. 
1	I am just always worried that something else will be wrong with me now. I have several chronic illnesses and wouldn't be surprised if I get another.
1	I am often anxious that I will be judged if I speak the truth about my health care needs and concerns. I am concerned that I am sent to different doctors who ultimately don't have answers for what is going on with me. I am worried my doctor will continue to push me to take meds that I suffer side effects from. I worry that I will fail to convince my doctor that I am really having problems.
-1	The only things that makes me feel anxious or worried are the results I may receive, sometimes I personally go and google my symptoms ( which isn't always the smartest thing to do) and it usually gives me some of the worse diagnosis of what could potentially be ailing me. So when I get to the doctor's office my mind is always focused on those things I've read it could be. So I be anxious to get seen to be told what it really is and worried that it's one of the things I think it is.
1	It's not just visiting the doctor's office that makes me feel most anxious or worried I'm always anxious and worried.
1	i get anxious because i dont always know what to expect out of the appointment or what any next steps will be

1	I don't trust the doctors I believe they can falsify test results to make them more money. I'll go because I do believe they have ten percent truth but i will make that judgement call. However, you never know what to expect from a business man. The doctors face moral and business decisions every day.

1	I am a cancer patient. I am approaching my 60th birthday, and I am beginning to experience health concerns that are related to my age. It causes me anxiety to learn about changing health parameters, such as blood pressure, that are more difficult for me to cope with due to my increasing age.

1	I worry about what tests may have to be performed and what may be discovered by these tests, and any consequences to me or my family
1	That something will be really wrong with me that can't be fixed or hard to fix. I feel like it is better not knowing even though it is not 
1	The diagnosis is what makes me anxious, because I just was told that I was in renal failure and needed to go on dialysis. I was so anxious that I had to take an extra clonapen that is part of the instruction that my other doctor ordered to me. Than I think that is when the worried feeling comes in.  He explains very slowly and clearly to where I am able to understand what my future holds for me.  He always keeps the door open for any problems. 
-1	What makes me feel anxious is whether I am going to get new information or not.

1	When i have to wait an extended period of time to talk with my doctor i sometimes get anxious and worried.
-1	I don't like the environment of the doctors room. It makes me uncomfortable some times and gets me usually quiet a bit nervous while there.
1	I guess the number one thing is fear that a routine exam or test will uncover something really wrong with me.  Now, to be fair, I am a paranoid hypochondriac.  So any time I get the slightest little pain or perhaps a lump or something, I am convinced it's terminal cancer and I'm going to die in 3 weeks.  Needless to say, that has so far not happened.  So I think it's very important that I have the ability to access proper medical care (in the past I haven't always had the access)  to go and get checked out on a regular basis, more for my own mental peace of mind than because there is something actually really wrong with me.  Other than that, sometimes I do worry that a doctor or nurse will be judgmental and make comments to me about certain unhealthy characteristics like my weight or smoking, but that's not nearly as big a concern.

-1	If I have all of my children with me Iâm only anxious that they will behave.  Iâm sometimes anxious that if I donât agree with what the doctor says I wonât feel bold enough to question it to their face.  I feel anxious when thereâs a disconnect between what they believe about a topic and what I believe.  I donât want to appear like I know more than the doctor, like I question their authority.  I feel anxious about not being in agreement with the doctor because I want to do what is right.  I donât like feeling like I have to go research on my own to make that determination.  
1	Because there's no telling what medication they gonna put me on or nothing cause I'm tired of all these muscle relaxers and pain medication.
-1	That I am not going to receive the proper care and relief to my issues. That he is going to make a mistake due to laziness or make a wrong decision due to his comfort level
-1	That he will find something seriously wrong with me that isn't fixable. That he will tell me I can no longer take care of myself.
-1	I really don't get anxious or worried at the doctor. But If I had to pick something it would be my annual women's exam because my papsmear sometimes is a little painful

1	I am worried about something being wrong with me that i am not aware of. I am worried about unexpected medical expenses.

1	I feel worried when visiting the doctor because I don't know what she is going to find or send me to get test done for.
-1	It's a little irratiol, but sometimes when I'm in the waiting room, I worry about that the doctor might find something terribly wrong. I know there's nothing really wrong because I feel fine, but in the back of my mind, I still think something might crop up that will be a terrible burden to treat. 
-1	If I have to go for tests, or have my blood drawn which I don't like any of the above. I don't have anything else to talk about
1	bad news that I cant fixed or needed surgery is always scary life treat is always not goof newss swfwfqdf
1	I am worried that the doctor might inform me of some horrible health news that will ruin my life. I am worried about getting some horrible news that could mean the end of my life.
1	I feel as though the drs. may find something seriously wrong with me. I am afraid of the things the tests and labs will show.
-1	Just that they might find something wrong with me.  Like a mole that is too big or some lump I did not notice.  Nothing major just the general anxiety that comes with going to the doctor.  You never know when something that you think is small or did not even notice could turn into something big.  You hear about it all of the time.
1	I feel the most anxious and or worried if the Doctor may give me different results that I was hoping for, for some unexpected reason, that's why I am always trying to imagine the worst case scenario.
1	What makes me feel most anxious is not knowing if there is anything wrong with me when it seems like there is not. It is also just the unknown and maybe the doctor having to bear that bad news to tell me. There is also me having to worry what the doctor will think too. 
-1	Nothing.  I have no anxieties or worries when visiting my doctor or his office.  They are very thorough and efficient.
-1	Uncertainty is what would bother me the most. The uncertainty of if something is wrong and what to do if there is something wrong. 
1	I get nervous about the doctor telling me any kind of test result. I know several common conditions run in my family, and I have been trying pretty hard to avoid developing them myself. If a doctor were to tell me I'm diabetic or have hypertension, it would destroy me. I know I don't live the healthiest lifestyle, but to develop a lifelong condition would just kill me.  
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office unless I have a reason too; which at this point and time I cannot think of any.
-1	If he is crowded and I got a long wait before getting seen nothing else .I have no fear of bad news or  bad health reports, test.
1	Being given some negative information about my health that I had no awareness of.
-1	Not really about the doctor but more about what I might find out and how much it will cost.
-1	What makes me feel most anxious is if they discover something that is wrong with me that I do not expect in the least. I am a very healthy person, but it would be extremely upsetting if something like that came up.
1	Fear that I will hear something I didn't want to hear about my health. I always think the worst. They basically always tell me the same thing regardless
1	my doctor might seen me to the hospital to get tests run and they might fine something that I don,t want to hear about.
-1	I don't want to hear any bad news. I am also worried about how much it is going to cost for all of my services.
-1	I do not like needles so having to take a blood sample with usually make me a little worried.
1	I'm always worried that what they think is wrong with me is incorrect. I think that it is something worse than what it is.
-1	Always afraid something is going to come up wrong. So am sometimes nervous till results come back normal. I think a lot of people now days are like that.
1	I'm anxious about my diagnosis and prognosis, how it is going to effect my life going forward and if it will effect my family also 
-1	If I have maybe a bump or an ailment which I kind of worry if it's something more. The head games you play with yourself where you try to play doctor but really your brain just goes to worst case scenarios. 
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor, as all it is for is a check-up.  I have not needed the services of a doctor since I was a child. 
-1	This depends highly on the current health situation. If I had a serious health issue, I'm sure I would feel some anxiety about the diagnosis and treatment. Maybe more so about the costs than anything else. 
1	My age, I always think they may find something that might be devastating or troubling. with my existing conditions I dread something may have gotten worse or something new may come up.
1	I am worried first and foremost about the cost of procedures.  Next, I'm afraid of being misgendered and then misracialized.
1	I have anxiety to being with, and any kind of scrutiny amplifies it. When the doctor is performing a checkup, I feel like I am in the spotlight and being judged. 
-1	I will be worried if they will told me to undergo medication because I will need money in order to that.  I hate expenses.
1	I get most upset and worried when it comes to physical examitions because of my own persol views about myself and my body.
1	that i will be belittled, and my concerns wont be addressed because they will make up their mind about it with little information and dont do a full exam.
-1	I think I feel most anxious when I think I'll get back bad news. My something change since my last checkup, that can impact me in a negative way. 
1	The results of my blood work can cause me to worry a little, but not much...I know that I just need to focus on the issues and do my best to make sure my health improves
-1	My biggest fear is that I have something terminal and that when they examine me they will discover something terrible.  I am very anxious to get the results of tests and screenings.

-1	The thing that probably makes me feel the most anxious is when my doctor finds something potentially wrong that I didn't know about, especially if it could potentially be a really big deal.  At one point he was worried about a mole I had on my skin being potential melanoma so he removed it and had it tested.  The test came back negative, but the roughly 1 week it took to get the results was nerve-wracking.  
-1	I just have anxiety in a doctor's office, for no particular reason. I don't fear anything wrong, just anxiety.

-1	I am relatively healthy so other than a little nervous over a doctor visit in general, I am comfortable in the doctors office
1	I feel anxious when I visit a new doctor and they do not know me or my health issues. I do not trust many doctors due to medical malpractice and the fact that some doctors just want money.
1	Don't really feel anxious or worried. I'm sure I haven't committed my self to the ammentities of life. 
1	Always concerned what a particular symptom represents. I hope that the conditions I been diagnosed with have not gotten worse and that the medication I'm taking is working properly. I also hope there is not a new condition to report. I'm concerned with the medication that is prescribed; will it work, are there side effects, does my insurance cover it and can I afford it. Lastly, will this doctor visit be affordable.
-1	Nothing, I am never anxious or worried when visiting my Doctor's Office.  He always listens to me and cares to see that I have the best meds and best treatment that is available for my condition.
-1	If and or when I ever visit a doctors office or a hospital, I am never anxious or worried about anything to be honest.
-1	Nothing. All my doctor's and I get along well and there is nothing for me to be anxious over. If anything goes medically wrong then so be it.
1	I feel most anxious visiting the doctor's office when I need to have blood work and tests. I greatly hate needles.
1	Processing information with discernment and caution requires some time that allows for anxiety to occur while contemplating options and possible outcomes.
-1	I have never felt any sense of dread or nervousness or anxiety about an exam . I really have no reason to feel that way. 
-1	Not too much makes me concerned when I am at the doctors office. i dont go very often but when I do it's usually not for a major issue, its just because its time to check up on my health so usually I am not worried. If there is something going on that brings me in that might make me a little anxious, especially if I have to get tests done because I dont get the results right away.
-1	A long wait makes me feel anxious.  If the doctor were to suggest a test that I was not expecting I would be worried.
1	I worry that the doctor is going to talk to me about my weight. I think that they are focused on it and even if I am just doing something simple they want to weight me.
1	I feel most anxious or worried when I start thinking that they don't believe what I am saying. I am also worried that they are going to get angry with me for things I do or don't do. 
-1	I worry that I might have a serious illness.  I don't have much money, so I can't really afford to be sick.
-1	The things that makes me anxious about going to the doctor's office is getting weighed on the scale.
1	If I have a condition that suddenly occurred and I cannot find any information about it. I am also worried about high medical bills.
-1	I am most anxious or worried about visiting the doctor because one can never know what will be found out about my health. But this stems from the fact that I have largely avoided doctors for most of my life. If I regularly visited a doctor, then perhaps I would be less worried.
1	The possibility that they may find something wrong that could be serious. Maybe I could have missed something or it could be something that I don't know how to find. 
-1	I feel most anxious every 3 months when i go for my check-up. I am diabetic and I hate to get weighed and worry about my A1C level and what it will be after getting the results of my blood test.
1	My only worries occur when a condition is one that may be lethal.  I have lived with a chronic medical condition for over 25 years.  As long as I can expect recovery, I am OK.
-1	Getting to my appointment on time.
-1	Obviousley, him finding out I'm sick. Him finding out something on me is broken. Or even him telling me I'm uble to reproduce. 
1	the process of getting an appointment, getting there, sometimes waiting, getting rushed through all leave me feeling worn out (I have a mobility impairment)
-1	I am getting older, and I fear that a condition is in the works that I do not know about.  I fear that something is happening right now that I won't be able to bounce back from.  
-1	I feel anxious that the doctor will be in a rush and I will not be able to ask questions I have.
-1	Sometimes when I don't know what is going on and I think it could be two or three different things. I get anxious wanting to know what it is and what I might or might not have done to cause it.
-1	Sometimes the fear of not knowing what is wrong with my children . They typically are over worried things typically turn out perfect 
1	Finding out that something is wrong with my health and that I will have a short while to live or that perhaps my lifestyle choices will have taken a significant toll on my body and state of health.
-1	Because I have some current and past health issues, I am often anxious about whether these health issues may be negatively effecting my health in a serious way. I am also nervous that my doctor may ask me questions that I am nervous to answer because I feel I might've done something to negatively effect my health.
1	I always seem to look for the worst in most scenarios and thus my fear is always looking for something negative and overlooking that sometimes there is nothing to really worry about.  I like to be prepared.
1	The not knowing why they do what they are doing when they are doing it. I have yet to find a doctor that will answer my ongoing questions as to WHY things are done and What the purpose of those are, in a complete way. Sometimes the answers that I get just make me have more questions.
1	I get nervous that the doctor will scrutinize my health. I do not want to here things that I know, like drinking less pop or eating less carbs etc. I also get worried they may find some serious health complication that will upend my life.
1	I fear that I will be sick and that insurance will not cover it. I feel that the offices make me sick. I also think the doctor wants to get me in trouble with the insurance company so I lose my plan.
-1	Well, if I'm going to the doctor's office (other than for a routine checkup) it's because I think something is wrong. If I think something is wrong, I'm worried about what that might be! Although usually they don't find anything to start with, then it's rounds of tests and exams and more uncertainty, which is stressful.
-1	I have a history of respiratory issues, and they pop up fairly often. If I go in for a problem like that, I'm always worried it might be pneumonia again, which I've had several times in the last few years. Other than that, I don't really worry too much when I see the doctor.
1	I don't know why I am always anxious or worried but a lot going on with my future that gets me worried so I am trying to be the best I can.
-1	I would feel anxious or worried if I knew something was wrong with me and I was waiting for test results or a doctor's opinion.
-1	
1	I'm always afraid they won't take my concerns seriously, that they think I'm over-exaggerating my symptoms. I've had a doctor flat out tell me I was wrong even though I knew I was correct and it led to a fear that I just won't be listened to. 
-1	That my blood pressure shall spike (I think I have white coat syndrome) and they will want to increase my blood pressure medicines.
-1	When visiting the doctors office, the fear of the unknown makes me feel most anxious. Going in for an ear infection and finding out I have cancer for example. 
1	just been to so many doctors feel more worn out and tired of all the appointments. there have been times i've been worried but i don't have the energy anymore for much worry. 
1	OKAY every time i go to the doctor i have this weird feeling that im bond to get some shots they i probably i already had i been getting shots all my life why do the doctor insist that i begin giving a needle stuck into my body like how would yall feel if everytime y'all walked into the doctor office they where preparing yall where preparing yall for shoots in stuff life aint fair i know that but can i please just get a break is this enough okay thank you. :D 
1	Cost is always a big factor and then you worry about what they may find and what treatments and/or prescriptions that you will have to take and what side effects could be included. 
-1	I get anxious that something will be wrong with me I always worry about that when I go
1	I always feel anxious when going to the doctor no matter if it is just for a physical and nothing serious. I always dread getting bad news.
1	Making me fell anxious ð© is when I need to know the results of what's going on with body if there's something really wrong with me or not
1	Just being there meaning something is wrong just puts me in an anxious mood.
1	I do not know what he will do or say. I also fear something being very serious and needing to have to go to the hospital. I am not a fan of hospitals. I have had one surgery, and that is enough for me. I do not want any more. Think about it: One guy knocks you out while another cuts into you with a knife. Not something to make you feel good about.
1	I am worried I will go home still not knowing what is wrong with me.
1	I'm anxious to know what's going on with my body, and worried that the little pains may be something more serious
-1	Seeing if I have gained weight.
-1	I fee anxius about visiting a doctor since i dont want any bad news, and i fear being diagnosed with something that would cost lots of money or would be deadly
1	That the doctor is going to just get me in and get me out and not listen to what I have to say about my health and how I feel and to care about how I am going to be treated.
1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious or worried when seeing my Doctor is when I know I haven't been doing what I was supposed to and I know what the doctor is going to say about it 
1	I am afraid that something will be wrong, and talking to people in any situation causes me anxiety. I am also extremely pain averse.
-1	nothing -I do get upset and tend to walk out if he she has not seen me within 30 minutes of my appointment
-1	The main thing that makes me feel anxious about going to the doctor would be if I were waiting for test results to determine if something was wrong with my health and what was wrong with my health.
1	I've always been anxious when going to the doctor's office but it has nothing to do with my doctors or their staff. I'm always concerned that some small ailment will end up being a larger issue. I've also had family members diagnosed with serious illnesses, so I worry that my time will be up at some point.
-1	I don't generally feel anxious when I visit the doctor's office. I trust the physician and I don't have any serious ailments so I don't really have reason to worry.  At worst, sometimes I forget to bring my insurance card or have to do paperwork. The paperwork is always the worst part.
-1	I usually don't feel anxious when going to the doctor I'm actually hopeful that whatever happens and whatever diagnosis he gives me is going to be for my best well-being and will help me get into a better healthy condition
1	I always feel anxious when I go there and they have to run a lot of test on me and draw my blood.  It seems they can never find a good vein to draw from and end up sticking me in several places.  My arm s usually black and blood when they are done.
1	Some doctors act as if my life is theirs to control.  Being talked down to causes me fear and anxiety.  It makes me feel as though they don't care to understand me as a person.
1	It's not knowing test results. I want to hear quickly that I don't have serious illnesses. Then I can calm down and deal with what's bothering me.
-1	If I have a certain concern and not sure what the cause or problem is, I may feel anxious until the doctor can evaluate the problem and give me his opinion of the situation.
-1	The thing that makes me the most worried is wondering if my doctor will diagnose me with some sort of rare sickness that will cost a lot of money or if he will have to check my testicles for cancer. 
-1	
-1	I feel most anxious and worried when going to the doctors because I want it over with.nerves run through a woman.
-1	I'm not sure if it counts, since it doesn't actually relate to the actual doctor's office, but the drive over there makes me feel the most anxious.  I have panic attacks when I drive and I really hate to drive because of it.  If that doesn't count, I guess the only anxiety I would feel is if my doctor wasn't in that day since they have three different doctors and I only like him.
-1	Uncertain of what they will do and if what they do will cause me physical pain and just the thought of not knowing what's wrong with you or how to treat you
-1	I don't normally feel anxious for myself, but i do get nervous for my child and unborn baby. I worry that a simple cold is actually cancer or that the baby will have some rare disease. With myself, I worry that I will have cancer and won't be able to raise my kids. The actual doctor doesn't make me nervous at all. 
-1	I get most anxious or worried when they don't explain things, use medical terminology or place instruments where I can't see them.
1	mainly not knowing what might be found since in our family history we have a little bit of everything that has come up in one form or another. 
1	I have more of an untural fear of doctors and dentists. This is most likely due to the fact that I so seldom need to see a doctor. If I had been unhealthy and seen a lot of doctors, I suspect I would be way more comfortable with the process. But I assume it's much better to be healthy and see a doctor seldom and to be sick and see a doctor so often as to not be uncomfortable.  :)
-1	I get anxious when I have an exam, because I don't want them to find anything wrong with my blood work or exams.  I am scared of being really sick or getting cancer and that makes me anxious.
1	The first worrying thought in my mind is always the possibility of being told some new negative information, such as my health has worsened or I have developed some entirely new health complication. I also don't like the thought of having to need some new medication since I'm already on several. Other than that, one of the main things that I'm always anxious about is the possibility of having to get a blood exam, since I am extremely terrified of needles.
-1	Mostly, I am an anxious person in general. Plus, I'm always a bit worried that something will show up that is wrong with me. Doctors offices in general make me a bit anxious.
1	Im worried because im not sure what the doctor will find. I have many discouraging health history in my family
1	Being told that something is severely wrong with me. I just had this happen recently when I went for a physical and ANS turned up positive (auto immune issue). I still have to go to another lab for a more detailed test and I've been putting it off since I kind of dread it, plus, it's is a hassle. I'm also always uneasy when I'm getting examined I don't have a specific reason, I just don't like it. I also hate getting undressed and having the whole staff in and out and you are sitting there naked in a paper gown. 
1	Expenses are a big part of it, but I also don't feel very thrilled about finding out what may be wrong with me either.  Plus, my injury made me feel very useless, I couldn't work or do a lot of other things and those feelings sort of colored all of the experiences that I had at the time if that makes any sense.
-1	Nothing specific.  I do not take great care of myself and have a rough family medical history.
-1	The idea that I'm going to have to pay for it, or will need to buy medication, or will have to put up with a serious amount of tests.
1	Learning something that could be worse Than what we think. You never know what your going in for. Also get nervous if they don't speak out language since we live so close to another country 
-1	Nothing at all.  I feel completely calm and collected when I visit his office.  The only issue I ever have is somebody bringing a loud obnoxious child to the office with them but that doesn't really have anything to do with the office itself.
1	I always have been a very nervous and anxious person by nature and i do not like going to the doctor. I always think they are going to give me bad news.
1	I fear the unknown just like everyone else.
1	I am always worried about receiving news I am not going to be able to handle. I don't want to get news that is going to leave me forever emotional.
-1	
1	In general I get stressed when going to a doctor. There is no certain reason why I get that way but I do. I think it may go back to my childhood going to doctors worrying about getting shots, etc.
1	Well I really can't blame the doctor for this one. I have just always felt very anxious about visiting a doctor (or dentist, for that matter). I am always fearful that they will find something wrong with me that I was unaware of, or that the visit will entail pain I don't want to deal with (such as shots, drawing blood, etc.) I wouldn't say I'm a problem patient though, it's just that I am quietly anxious about my appointments. 
-1	What blood tests may find or a simple,x-ray. Kind of like opening Pandora's box. If you go when you gave symptoms that you've read anout, you may think it's the worse thing, like cancer
1	He glossed over my concerns, ignoring my questions.  He insisted his analysis was correct despite the fact that the lab work does not support his claims.  He forced me to take a drug I do NOT want in my body, knowing that I am forced to see him until my divorce is final & I can choose a new insurance plan.
-1	If I've been feel pain, I might worry that it might be an indicator of something serious. That situation would cause me the most worry.
-1	I am most anxious when I do my blood work or when I have a pap smear. I always fear the worst. I don't know why, but I always feel like something is wrong. Things usually turn out alright, but I still always doubt things.
1	I worry that they are going to tell me something is wrong, that I am sick or dying. Just a general fear of receiving bad news.
-1	Sometimes I am anxious to see the doctor out of fear of receiving bad news.  My largest concern would be hearing that I have a terminal illness or that something else is wrong with my health.  I would just prefer to positive news when it comes to my health.
1	I feel most anxious and worried about receiving bad news or news that means high costs or extended time away from work.  I am also nervous about potential uncomfortable tests and procedures.  Sometimes I think that my doctor is silently judging me for my appearance or other physical quality/attribute.
-1	I don't usually get worried.  there was a time when I had my self convinced that I had ovarian cancer.  I went to the doctor to talk to her about it.  That day I was worried, but it wasn't anything about my actual doctor that gave me anxiety. It was me self-diagnosing myself that had me all worked up. 
-1	What makes the most anxious is when they're running extremely late and I have to sit there and wait.  It gets me upset that they don't care that I've had to take time out of my day and they should be courteous to others as we are to them.
1	"I worry I am not being taken seriously and that I am going to be told or made to think ""it is all in my head"". I worry that they are in such a rush that they will not really listen and hear me or my concerns. I worry that ""because I am young"", they are going to assume everything is fine and I have nothing to worry about."
-1	The reason. That I might feel anxious about my do tor's visit is primarily because if my weight and the fact that it's creeping up as I get older
1	You never know what your results are going to show so that can be nerve wracking. But also being examined fully by someone you donât know very well is just uncomfortable 
-1	What makes me more anxious while visiting the doctor's office is thinking about what they will say about anything.
-1	The main thing that makes me anxious when going to the doctor is wondering if they will find something very wrong with me. I worry about ever contracting a deadly disease where it is unlikely to be cured. This reason alone is why I make sure I see my doctor for my annual checkups. I want to know well in advance if I need to get something treated. 
1	I be worried and anxious like any other human because l don't know what l will hear from my doctor about my diagnosis. 
1	 It's not necessarily the doctors, I'm just a very anxious person. I suffer from anxiety and depression.
1	I'm really not certain as to why I feel this way towards doctors. Perhaps it's not knowing what's going to happen or what they might say/do (especially if going in for a physical).
1	I hate sitting in the waiting room. It is noisy, dirty, and loud with patients, kids and the TVs blasting. The waiting room is not conducive to people who have mental disorders. Then when I am answering the basic, every visit questions (like do I feel like hurting myself or others) I feel anxious that he is not listening or caring how I really feel unless I answer opposite of what I know the correct answer is. He barely looks at me when talking to me and has used another patient's name when writing my prescriptions. I don't trust him nor do I even like him. I want to go back to my other doctor.
1	The unexpected . Not knowing what the diagnosis is or if a prescription is necessary and what the total cost will amount to.
1	My doctor seems reluctant to prescribe me certain medications, and it makes me think that he views me as someone who is drug seeking.
-1	The only time I fell anxious or worried when going to the doctor is when I think that I might have something wrong with me.
-1	I have felt anxious or worried only once when seeing my doctor, and that weas when I had a naccident which fractured my hip.  I had never before experienced a broken bone and was fearful about how painful or long the treatment for recovery would be.
1	Because of my pre existing condition I suffer extreme fatigue, yet so many of the doctors want to prescribe me meds that have fatigue as a side effect, like gabapentin. I have to explain that I won't take medication that will fatigue me because I have a small child to take care of. I can barely function as it is with my level of disability, I don't want things that make it worse. Also I have a liver issue Gilbert's syndrome, that affects how I process medication. I've had weird side effects, for example to stemetil for nausea and was told by my doctor they only saw that in children or people with compromised liver enzymes. I have had bad reactions to all types of anti depressants from tri cyclics through SSRIs, which caused me in the former to be almost comatose and dissociated to in the later case have uncontrollable muscle spasms. I feel disbelieved by doctors and dread seeing them because they always want to give me drugs that give me adverse effects. The drugs that don't bother me so much they won't prescribe. For example NSAIDs completely mess up my stomach and acetaminophen is bad for my liver, so the best drug for pain relief for me is a small amount of codeine, not tramadol, not vicodin, not percocet, all the artificial opioids make me hallucinate, but codeine does not. However physicians wont prescribe codeine to me. I have complex over lapping conditions and none of my doctors talk or communicate with each other. I see a neurologist, a gastroenterologist, a urologist, an ent doctor, a breast specialist, an ob gyn. I get overwhelmed with all the advice and the lack of effective treatments for my diseases.
-1	The mere fact of not knowing what the condition is worse than knowing tell me what's going on so we can go from there 
1	I think that I'm being ruched through my visit. I feel like any questions I have arem't taken seriously and I feel under appreciated
-1	If Im going through things that are happening and that are going to happen in the future. Not having money in my pockets 
1	I don't like to be undressed in a doctor's office. I don't like to show my body to anyone but my husband. I hate getting tests done and i don't know the results of the test
1	I feel like I am not going to be able to clearly explain how I am feeling to her. I don't want he to think I am over exaggeration anything so I kind of hold back but then I feel she won't really understand what I am dealing with. 
-1	Just visiting and finding out bad news and no one ever want to hear anything is wrong with them so it makes you worry 
1	The thing that really bothers me about going to the doctor is that he will order another MRI on my back again. I had a frightening extreme case of claustraphobia one time a year ago in a very small MRI machine and I am afraid that I will experience that again.
1	Mostly, I am concerned that I will have a major health problem diagnosed or discovered. I am always thinking of the worst possible scenarios in the moments leading to my scheduled appointments, especially when it's not a regular checkup and I am going to the appointment because I am feeling ill or something similar. Those moments always make me anxious, and I usually feel relief when the appointment is over and nothing major is discovered.
1	The no anxious when it comes to visiting my doctor, cause i take care of myself, so there no need to worry about bad new
1	Any time that a person isn't feeling well or having issues, makes a person nervous. Sometimes just worrying about the unknown is worse than worrying about the symptoms.
-1	I do not have any problem with my visit to my doctors, they do there job and give me what I need and I go on my way.
1	I'm always afraid I'm going to find out something bad is wrong with me and I don't want any bad news from my doctor.
-1	I really do not feel anxious at all about visiting the doctors office I take care of myself and know if something is wrong I do not wait until I am sick I see her three four times a year
-1	I don't feel either anxious or worried because I trust him and have been going to him for quite a few years.
1	I am most worried about being told I am sick and that something is wrong. I also get anxious over having to wait a long time to see the doctor
-1	I might be worried something might be found that might be bad but I try to be optimistic and pray.
-1	I WAS FEELING WORRIED ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME OR IF MY CONDITION WAS IMPROVING. I GUESS I AM ALWAYS ANXIOUS ABOUT GETTING ON MORE MEDICATION THAN I WANT TO.
-1	it is generally not something i enjoy doing so there is some anxiety that goes along with that feeling
1	The wait and the pausing of the words instead of coming straight out and saying something I wish they would be straight forward
-1	Its the whole scene of making the trip their, sitting in the waiting room, surrounded by strangers and their aliments with my my thoughts that drift off to cooler place I wish to be. 
-1	I think the things that make me feel anxious or worried is the doctor coming back saying something is wrong with my health. I also gets a little worried when he's going over test results and finding out I'm not doing recommended suggestions like exercise or eat righg. I worried that im gonna get fussed at by my doctor for being hard headed.
-1	How seevere is my condition.Some doctors like to practice fear mongering.
-1	If he is going to tell me something wrong.I am not anxious about my doctor.I feel good most of time when I go to my doctor office.
-1	
1	my doctor gives me the way to express my feeling and sometimes does not listen it is frustrating and a little dishearting as I need his attention.
-1	Nothing in particular.  I'm pretty much comfortable there.  Nothing has ever happened that I would be terribly anxious.  I think a certain degree of anxiety is normal if you are sick and going to the doctor.  I think the anxiety is more related to the illness or symptoms than seeing the doctor.
-1	
-1	"As someone who is overweight, I feel anxious about what it might be doing to my health -- although in a general sense, I am a healthy person, with good blood pressure, etc. I also sometimes worry about symptoms when they might have a very easy explanation; I tend to ""overthink"" things."
-1	I'm at the age where 29 years of firefighting are catching up with me. This is wehre the weird cancers, heart problems, etc start coming in . I will probably have to take early retirement due to my TBI, so I am dreading that
1	"What makes me most anxious and worried is not knowing the doctor personally enough so that you know whether or not they have your best interest in mind on that particular day.  I think like anyone off that doctors can have ""off"" days."
-1	I feel most anxious about getting a bad diagnosis. But on the flip side I also feel anxious that my doctor will not take my symptoms seriously and will think I'm overreacting (it's happened to me too many times).
1	I get anxious sometimes believing the doctor is going to tell me something negative about my health. I also stress out about having some medical procedure that will cost me out of pocket money, for some outrageous medical bill I will receive. 
1	I feel most anxious about my weight when visit the doctor. I am always struggling with my weight and I hate to see the number on the scale, it fills me with dread. 
1	I feel anxious or worried when I go to the doctor because I am a private person and sometimes I dislike talking about things that may be wrong and sometimes getting the answer is scary. I have been to many doctors in my life and do not like going  
1	i don't think i feel anxious in just the doctors office.  Because of my mental illness i often feel anxious in public sometimes even at home 
-1	Nothing I have complete faith and trust in my pcp. She always examines me in a gentle and compassionate way.
1	I have social anxiety so I am not comfortable with talking to people  that I don't know. When it comes to my daughter and taking her to the doctor I am okay with speaking with her pediatrician 
-1	I am usuall calm when I visit the doctor. Mostly because I have no worries about any health issues. Therefore I have no reason to be worried, upset or anxious.
1	I am always worried they might find something that I don't want to know, at my age I don't need any more bad news about my health
1	I feel like doctors only give you bad new, a bunch of rx to mask the issue and really don't take the time to truly help
1	I am afraid of being judged.  I am overweight and I haven't been to a PCP in many yrs.  Both of these things will bring judgment on me.
1	That my condition has gotten worse, and that the medication is not working anymore and we may need to make a change. 
-1	I only feel worried if I think my symptoms will lead to a serious diagnosis.  Also if several test have to be performed in which I have to wait a while for the results.
1	I might found out that I have a disease or disorder. Since I smoke I always anxious and worried that I may have got a disease from smoking.
-1	Well, I don't want any bad news. Also, I just feel like I want to get it over with. I feel as if I am very rushed.
-1	I feel anxious and worried when doesn't have an answer and needs me to see a specialty doctor. I trust him completely and makes me nervous about my problem till I see the other doctor. 
-1	Nothing makes me feel nervous about seeing a doctor
-1	the waiting for the doctor to see me for my appointment.  The results from my labs. The doctor always makes me feel at ease for my appointments.
1	I mostly feel anxious and nervous about what the doctor may say when your in the doctors office you never know what the doctor may say. Some people go to the doctor for a cold and come out with cancer something they never thought they had and didn't have any signs of.
-1	Nothing makes me feel too anxious except for getting shots. Everyone hates getting shots. They aren't comfortable and they aren't exactly the best birthday gift! ð
1	What makes me feel anxious about the doctor's office is either needles or when they give you a surgery
-1	I naturally become anxious when I see doctors. My blood pressure is normally on the lower side, although it is still normal. When I go to my doctor, my blood pressure rises to 120/80 which, again, is still normal, but not MY normal blood pressure when I am relaxed. Also, I am worried he will be disappointed in slow weight loss since I began losing weight in February 2017.
-1	Mostly what upsets me is the fear of the unknown. I rarely go to the doctor because I have a good understanding of the human body and various illnesses/injuries. So when I do go, it's because I either need a treatment I don't have access to or I have a condition that I cannot quantify, which is unnerving to me. 
-1	might get my blood pressure up by worry about result of blood work, etc. just going to dr. make me nervous. do  not always feel like dr has my best interest in mind when dr wants me to have numerous tests and more medication.
1	i always worry that i haven't been doing the right things to be proactive with my health. i have a lot of health problems so that makes it harder.

If I had 100% certainty that a particular ailment could be successfully treated with a particular approach or if pharmaceutical intervention would always work exactly as I wishes, my anxiety would likely abate. The not knowing makes it difficult for me and the waiting for results heightens the negative affect.

Also she would try to make it seem like I have sex or do drugs, I don't know if that will help her but I would say that I am still a virgin and that I have never done drugs, but she'll keep asking me am I sure about that.

1	These doctors always want to tell you something is wrong with you. Even if somethings wrong with me, I rather not know about it at all honestly.

1	There are a few facts relevant to how I am feeling at any given time that I just do not want to share. Alot of trust is not the same as complete trust, which I have for no one.
1	Just a normal reaction as anyone else.  Do no any problems to come up or any new problems that have to be addressed and not having to take any additional medicine.
-1	Only if its about something new that could be something very bad, or just awaiting answers on previous tests. Otherwise im always fine.
1	I've had doctors insult me, accuse me of lying, or jump to false conclusions. I don't feel safe in a doctor's office.

1	"What asinine charges are they going to bring up? Am I going to be charged because they used a gauze pad to cover a wound (should I have brought my own)? Are they going to find cause to put me through the most useless, expensive tests, because they ""feel"" there is some issue worth investigating? Are they even going to bother prescribing the correct medicines, or has some drug company paid them an exorbitant fee to prescribe their medicine above all others, even when that medication is unnecessary/not fit for the condition/better options are available?"
1	I just don't want bad news, simple as that. I believe no matter what he tells me, in the end it might be alright. But if the word cancer comes up, then I would be afraid, so that explains why I would feel anxious and scared about a medical exam. I think that is common with most people.
1	Even though I am relatively healthy and have no family history of major medical conditions, there is always the chance that something can go wrong. I wouldn't say I am extremely nervous when visiting my doctor but I am a bit anxious. 
1	I am always worried that I have some form of cancer. I smoked for many years and did not take care of myself becuase I was taking care of others. Now I am suffering for it. I want to live a long life, but I fear cancer
1	It would be finding something terribly wrong with me, like cancer or an unknown illness. That's the worst kind of news a doctor can give someone.
-1	just the setting makes me anxious, worry about what they will find or any additional tests that are required
-1	I don't feel a lot of these emotions. I usually am a pretty calm, cool, and collected person that tends not to make mountains out of mole hills. Due to the good fortune of never having a whole lot of serious health problems, my anxiety around doctors is pretty low, i'm not scared of needles, i believe in science and most of western medicine. I do experience some anxiety when waiting for test results, especially for serious things HIV, Hepatitis, Ect. I feel annoyance sometimes at having to wait so long in the waiting rooms, and do get a bit nervous about actually contracting diseases or sicknesses from waiting rooms and hospital lobbies. 
1	"I don't like most examitions especially the ones that invade much of my ""privacy"" as far as private parts. That always makes me nervous. It's just not a good feeling to have the doctor look at parts that are usually not disclosed unless to an intimate partner."

-1	I have white coat syndrome. No matter how many doctors appointments I have I always get nervous! Even if it's a normal check up! My blood pressure rises, and I typically have low blood pressure. But not at the doctor's office! And I know this so then I get nervous about my blood pressure going up, which of course makes it go up more. 
1	Obviously, that something is wrong. That you've gone in for something routine and there may be more going on than what you were prepared for. For example, going in for something that you thought was a swollen lymph node and being apprehensive that it could be cancer. I think about these sorts of things when I have an appointment. 
-1	Excessive wait times might cause me anxiety, but nothing specific about the doctor or his staff causes me worry.
-1	I might be anxious to know what the answer is to my medical problem or if I'm going to leave without that answer. To try this pill and let me know if it works. 
-1	I'm worried about the cost of a prescription or care. Healthcare here in America is very expensive. Right now I'm luckily on my parents' insurance, because I simply cannot afford my own as an individual. Once that time is up, and if I get sick or injured, I'm screwed. One of the biggest causes of bankruptcy in this country is due to healthcare bills.
-1	Nothing I'm always confident in my visits everything is always upfront and open honesty makes it easy I truly trust my doctors

1	 What makes you me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is nothing at all. I know that going to the doctor at least once a year is good to take care of you.
-1	"My body and my car share some interesting commonalities. When I take my car to a mechanic, I dread hearing, ""Well, it could be the alternator or it might be the wiring or maybe the starter.""  The same is true of a doctor's visit. The worst possible result is lack of clarity.  That being said, of course there are situations where lack of clarity is real, and as long as doctors have a plan for clarifying a situation, I'm OK. Not thrilled, but OK. The main way that doctors reduce my anxiety and worry is by convincing me that they are telling me what they know or believe in complete honesty. If I don't think a doctor is leveling with me, then I get really anxious. I would rather have a truthful, irascible doctor than a pleasant, uninformative one."
1	From time to time I am guilty of thinking along the line of assuming the worst rather than keeping it simple. In those types of thinking cycles it is easy to get worked up about some tests because I can imagine the results will come back telling me I have some horrible disease or worse. The reality is usually less traumatic.
1	Hearing bad news. I do not like hearing bad medical news that can affect myself or my family.  Also the waiting room makes me anxious

1	I am mostly nervous about the cost of the visit.  To a lesser extent I am worried about what he might find (ie cancer) or something of that ture.

1	"I have to be KED! Well, not exactly. The gown is open in the back though, making me feel exposed and vulnerable. I don't want to turn my head and cough while he checks out my ball sac. Sh*t, he's looking down there a bit too long. Is he gay? Oh, no, here come the latex gloves. ""Bend over,"" he says. "
-1	I don't usually feel this way. If I were to be anxious, it would be for a painful test or procedure. 
1	I am afraid and worried when I have blood work done because  I always think they are going to find something wrong with me. Also, I am afraid they are going to change the dosage of the medicine I am taking for my auto-immune disease because they would rather go by the lab work then how I feel. 
1	That he is going to yell at me or get frustrated with me.  He is going to try to give me pills i don't want.
-1	It's not as if I'm nervous or anxious every time, but you never know when you're going to get a disease

-1	I am concerned they could find an unexpected problem with my health that could require surgery or a lengthy hospital stay.
1	I always feel like I'm getting in trouble when I go to the doctor.  I see them as an authority figure and having to discuss any issue in detail causes me great anxiety.  I feel that they will blame me for whatever health issue is going on.  I don't feel they will be open to discussing other options or side effects of medications they prescribe.  I often feel dismissed if I want to try alternative natural options.  They treat me like I'm inferior and they know best.  I hate having to feel like I need to fight for my own health issues, instead of just do what is convenient for them.
1	Because you never know what kind of information they're going to tell you so you have to be prepared for any kind of news

1	"Anxiety is two-pronged, in this case: first, that the doctor may ""find something"" in my results, and second, the fact that he or she might not actually be correct about those findings. Doctors, again, are only human, and prone to mistakes or oversights. This makes all of their claims at least somewhat suspect. "

1	I feel like they don't really care that much and don't even try to pretend to.  They are quick to prescribe pills before any other options.
-1	I sometimes feel worried how my blood pressure will be because I do take medicine to control my blood pressure.

Itâs nerve wracking even though I am considered healthly based off my physical exams.

1	I am worried when checking up on chronic conditions, wanting to make sure that I am not about to hear bad news about my health. I think a doctor's office inherently makes people nervous.

-1	I am also worried and anxious that something is going to be wrong with me.  I'm just afraid for the worst care scenario.
-1	I would say just not making enough progress on the things I was given advice on last time. It's easy sometimes to hear information in the office, but applying it to daily life can be much more difficult.
