1	I'm always worried that I have some serious medical condition.  I'm a hypochondriac, and I think what worries me most is being diagnosed with some horrible condition that I've never heard of.  Also, I have a bit of a fear of needles.  I'd hate to be surprised by having to take a blood test.

1	"Realizing that the doctor is not listening to me and that I am not going to get sufficient care, and on top of that, that I'm going to be paying mega-bucks for this so-called ""healthcare"". What a joke. "
1	Thinking if they are really up to the task and willing to devote their full attention. If not, I may end up suffering from their incompetence and the lack of work ethic.  
1	You never want to hear something is wrong with you and what it takes to get better. Also needles scare me, so taking Blood is scary.
-1	I hate change and fear of the unknown. Waiting is also very hard especially when waiting on routine blood work, my mind will race and come up with utterly ridiculous scenarios. I fear the negative results of what has been in my family history.

-1	I'm not quite sure what it is, but every time I go to a doctors appointment I always feel a little trepidation. Its not that I'm worried they will find something wrong with me, but there is just always this sense of anticipation. It is completely illogical, and I know it.

1	I've had so many health problems in the last 10 years that a visit to the Dr. is almost never good news.

-1	The medical bill and the cost of the prescription is one of the things that have me anxious are worried

1	idk
1	Usually when I'm anxious for a Dr. visit it's when I'm feeling real bad and expecting the worst. In those cases it's always been less severe than I imagined which is a good thing.
1	Not knowing if something is going wrong with my body. I try to keep it in optimum health . Sometimes it's scary not knowing, especially when u are uneasy or unsure about something 
1	I get nervous about being around a lot of sick people. If I'm seeing a different doctor than normal I'm worried that they won't take me seriously. I also worry that there might be something really wrong with me if I can't figure out what is wrong on my own.
-1	Just the anxiety of waiting to hear if anything is seriously wrong. I get worried when I have to wait, but I'm usually reassured in the end.
-1	My doctor may find something wrong with me and she may not take my complaints as being valid . I never know if my doctor is going to be proactive concerning my care or delay treatment .
1	"I am always worries about getting ""grim news"" about a symptom I go see my doctor about.  I know being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness is rare, but I always feel I will be one of the unlucky ones who gets that bad news."
-1	I imagine it would be the uncertainty.  it is also uncomfortable.  why are you even asking this question?  you have to know the answer.
-1	The thought of being told wrong and complaint on how the doctor tells you that your body is going through changes
1	You never know what they are going to find.  Even if you feel totally healthy they could tell you something is wrong.  That is what makes me feel anxious.
1	"I'm most concerned that the doctor will find something wrong with me that was clearly my fault.  It's not so much that there's something wrong with me that bothers me; it's being faulted for my lifestyle and choices.  That seems really backwards and silly, perhaps, but that's my bigger fear.  It's not them saying, ""There's something wrong with you.""  It's them saying, ""You haven't been taking care of yourself."""
-1	Depending on why im going to the doctors I get worried of the results of what ever test or reason I neededâto go
-1	"I don't like it when the physician doesn't know what is wrong and has to refer me to a specialist. For example, I asked my physician ""Why can't you just do the biopsy?""  She said she didn't have the resources in the office.  It makes me very anxious when I have to make an appointment with another physician and wait while I don't know what is wrong.  This has happened to me in the last year.  Then for the BIGGEST thing that makes me anxious is worrying if my insurance, UHC, is going to try to pull some nonsense to get out of paying for something.  They actually did this, they made every nonsensical excuse not to pay the physician for the biopsy.  The physician's office eventually wrote off the expense, but that is not fair to them.  SO, my insurance trying to get out of paying is what makes me most anxious.  "
1	Just the fear that something may actually be wrong and I have no control over. It gives me a great deal of stress.
1	I worry that I won't be taken seriously. I worry that I won't be able to get what I need. I feel anxious about experiencing prejudice (many healthcare professiols have prejudice against fat patients and transgender patients). I worry about the results of lab tests. 
1	It is not comfortable being poked and prodded, so I always get anxious about that. And then I start thinking what if something shows up? There is a level they watch in my blood work and I worry it has fallen and I will have to go to a specialist. 
-1	Nothing, it doesn't make me anxious to go to the doctor.

1	Will I hear  bad news again or will I need more tests scares me. I've had open heart surgery and don't want to go thru that again...6 weeks in hospital.
1	The anxiety I believe comes from the uncertainty of what I might be told. Although I could leave the office with a clean bill of health there is always the chance you could find out you have a serious medical issue.
1	Every time I get lab work done and they send my test results in the mail in week I read the results to see if everything is alright. 
-1	I just get a little nervous in general when I go to the doctor usually when tests are being performed; no specific reason to my knowledge.
-1	If I have had one test or xray and I am called for a repeat one. If they call soon as you have left with test and cray results. 
1	The fact that there's a random person touching me makes me anxious not just because they're a doctor. 
-1	being told that I have to have more medication as i prefer to be working to a goal of not having to take medication

1	I am terrified of people and it controlt life I don't like leaving my home and stay mostly to myself
1	I am always worried that something is going to be really wrong and also they it will cost a lot of money. 
1	I always think the worst possible outcome when I go to the doctor. Because I read all kinds of health information online, I tend to think that I have the illness and my doctor tries to remain optimistic with me and not to think the worst all of the time.
1	You never know when they are going to find something that is going to be a problem.  Even when you feel healthy, an exam always makes me anxious.
1	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is finding out that I have any major problems or issues.
-1	Most of the time I worried that I might forget stuff that I need to tell him in order to help me with my condition.
-1	The wait time.
-1	Nothing, I go to the doctor for annual checkups and for something serious. I have think I have the best physician ever.ðð½
-1	Nothing really but if he might find something there and want to run test or tests  and the treatment options I might not agree with. I don't like taking a lot of medicine. So, I want other natural treatment options.
-1	I get most worried about the doctor not being able to find a diagnosis for what is wrong with me. I have had some health problems in the past that I have had a hard time finding a diagnosis for. This means more waiting and more doctor's visits in the future.
-1	As we age we always are concerned with developing health conditions, it is part of the aging process that is why I am so pro active in my healthcare, I also have a chronic condition, Crohns, that always need constant attention.

1	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile sample.
1	Really im just worried about my future and how im going to be in the future i just want to be sucessful at what ever im doing
-1	The thing I am most worried about is getting sick from other people while at the doctor's office.  I usually take herbal supplements and colloidal silver to overcome this issue.  The other thing I get worried about is the doctor not listening to what I have to say and then brushing me off as it's time to go the next patient.
-1	
1	"They will do what every other doctor has done in the past to me. They will treat me like everyone else. They will see that I am poor, and automatically assume I am there for ""another"" fix, or there for free pain drugs. I'm there becuase I have a legetiment issue with my body or mind, and don't know where else to go. But what they see is a poor, druggie looking to get another hit of their favorit cocktail. They see a ""ignorant hick"" that is incapable of processing complex information such as personal heath. They don't see an individual. They either see an issue they don't want to deal with, or a nice little bonus paycheck. The prior dismiss all my problems stating, ""it's nothing to worry about becuase I (the doctor) don't know at it is,"" the later stating, ""well, I see that Medicaid will pay for these sixteen different tests, let's do them all! (when none of them are nessesary)."" They lie, cheat, and steal like everyone else with power and money. If I should ever find myself feeling so terrible that I am considering seeing another doctor, I will assume I'm inches from death and STILL not go simply becuase they make me feel worse, mentally and physically, every time I go. "
-1	That he might find something or I might have something new going on. Lately I've been worried about my cholesterol. I've been wondering if my cholesterol is going down. I'm eating healthy and taking my medicine, but is that enough. I be thinking the doctor going to say my cholesterol is actually higher
-1	"I just think the overall of feeling of  ""what are they going to say about my current health status.""  Once the examination is completed and they begin to talk, I'm no longer anxious"

-1	if I have an extreme illness and it may be caught too late
-1	I sometimes feel anxious prior to arriving to the doctors office because of the unknown result. I believe that my condition can change from time to time and this causes a little worry. I trust my doctor's knowledge of medicine, his ability to diagnose conditions, and treated appropriately.
1	The main thing that causes anxiety for me when going in for a doctors visit is the financial consequences that might come from my visit. I have had bad experiences with insurance companies in the past and not being told upfront what I can expect to pay out-of-pocket. The other worry that arises is not knowing what kind of treatment I can expect and the time and effort that I might have to invest to treat the problem.

-1	Sometimes when I am having certain health issues I worry that I have something real bad wrong with me.
-1	When I am feeling very bad, I worry that it may be something serious.  Also, having to wait in the lobby and then in the room makes me anxious because I sometimes have to wait a long time.   The exam room has no windows and I sometimes feel claustrophobic. 
-1	Could feel that way if I were expecting a bad diagnosis, but this hasn't happened to me. I don't like waiting long periods of time in the waiting room or being charged more than I was told it would be.
-1	Sometimes going into the doctor not knowing what's going on myself can cause my nerves to rack. I feel most abnxiius about finding out the diagnosis and if it is life threatening or not.

1	I am worried or anxious as to what they might find and that they will tell me that I need to lose weight

1	If the doctor will sound harsh or criticize me.  If the doctor will ignore or discredit what I say.  If I end up having a really bad health problem.

-1	its mainly when i don't have a clue whats wrong and could be something serious.
-1	I have several health problems.  I am anxious that things might  not be going as smoothly as I think they are.
1	Even though I trust my doctor (and any of the specialists I see), I always get anxious about doctors appointments because there is always an element of unknown. There is always a chance they could discover something is wrong with you that is totally random and unrelated to what you came in for, and it could change your life. 
1	I worry they may call me a liar. I worry they may not trust what I say about what is bothering me. I worry they may tell other people I'm a liar. I worry they may put false things in my medical chart.
1	I hope for the best but I feel like I never know what the doctor is going to say about my health. I expect that there may be something wrong even it's minor.

1	The unknown, having diabetes you don't know what will come out of the appointment.   You may need your medication adjusted.

-1	I only feel anxious if I feel like the doctor has something to tell me but aren't being straight with me. 
1	Mostly relatively minor phobias about things like needles.

1	My doctor is trying to.put me.on medication that makes me pass out and fall down getting dizzy after I was taken off the only one that actually worked for me 
-1	because of the uncertainty of what they may discover during your time there. never no what they might fine wrong with you.
-1	I don't feel anxious when visiting my doctor's office.  The staff are always very nice and make me feel comfortable, and my doctor has fantastic bedside manner that makes me feel at ease.  The only thing I would feel worried about is not knowing what's wrong with me.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office idk what you mean soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yeaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!!

-1	When I visit my doctor for my examitions I am always anxious about m results. I always think that something might go wrong and this makes me nervous.
-1	I suffer from anxiety so I'm always anxious.  I'm afraid that the news may be bad about my health or my medications may need to be changed or increased 
-1	The thing that makes me the most nervous when visiting my doctor is when he discusses the possible negative outcomes of  my high blood pressure
1	That something dreadful may arise regarding my health with long term consequences. May have to take more meds.
1	The actual exam. I just don't like people touching me that way.
-1	I'm afraid of hospitals due to my childhood. I had to visit them a lot, so that gets me anxious already. I feel like I'm going to mess something up.
-1	I hate that if they find something else besides diabetes I will be put on another medication... I'm on enough. 
1	Getting new diagnosis and the follow up tests that comes with the diagnosis. It is anxious and worrisome especially if it is new.
1	I think the internet is a big contributing factor to me feeling anxious, because I often go online to research symptoms and of course I think the worse. More than likely if is never what I worry about. The other worry of course is what the cost of things will be.
-1	"The lack of concern for my health commonly demonstrated by the doctor. The assumption that I am an ignorant person without the capacity to understand what is being said to me. (That said, having done technical support for years, I can understand that attitude. ""My computer has a big blue screen that says I done somethin' illegal, but I didn't! It's all paid for, legal."" Yes, this is a real event.)"
1	That they will cause me more harm than good. 
1	I guess it is the fear that the doctor will find something wrong with me that I was not aware of which would be very upsetting.  Also not knowing the outcome of a diagnosis would worry me too.
-1	I feel most anxious when visiting the doctor office when I am scheduled to get shots or if I  very worried about a diagnosis.
-1	I really don't feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor but I suppose I will try to explain some reasons why I might.  The first and most important would be if I am concerned about my own condition or symptoms being something way more severe than it might be.
-1	I am always afraid that they will want to draw blood from me.  I have a very severe phobia of needles and I almost always pass out.  It's embarrassing and I always have to explain myself before they start the process.  I usually tell them it's probably safer for everyone if they let me lay down somewhere while they are taking the blood.  I have hit the floor several times and hurt myself after passing out.  It's a terrible thing to live with.  
-1	Always wanting my labs to show specific numbers pertaining to cholesterol, vitamin D and sugar levels- so I usually do both mentioned.

1	I'm afraid they will tell me something bad. 
-1	Cost of treatment Treating the pain or injury I have would cause me to stop doing something I like to do.
-1	Having rude and uncaring office staff, sitting around sick people in the waiting room and staff not letting you know if the Doc. is running late.
1	I find pap smears to be very painful and I've had negative experiences in the past. I dread it every time.
1	That they might find something else wrong with me that I didn't know was wrong. That they do a wrong diagnosis.
-1	I worry that there will be another diagnosis or a treatment that my insurance won't cover. I don't have the means to pay for healthcare outright
-1	It's probably a dumb reason, but her hands are very cold. She's a tiny woman and being in a doctor's office all day doesn't help her warm up. She apologizes, but that makes me a little anxious. If I had recently been ill, I also feel a little anxious about my lab results. I don't get many colds or the flu, but when I do I feel very sick. That makes me think there might be some other problem, but so far it's not been very serious. 
1	am afraid there might be something wrong that I'm not aware of and it might be too late to do anything about it
1	I have several chronic conditions.  I also take eight prescribed medicines on a daily basis.  I'm never sure of when the medications may have to be adjusted or replaced.
1	Most likely it's basically because I have never liked being physically touched and also because I have a fear that they will find something seriously wrong. I also don't want someone telling me that I have to change my way of doing things and I absolutely don't like being lectured to.
1	You know when you don't feel well or are in pain, but there are tests and measurements that can locate possible diseases or health issues that I may not even be aware of.  I'm also not very comfortable being ked, so that's very nerve wracking.

1	it's inconvenient to take time out of a work day to be at a doctor's office.  i don't like the feeling that i may or may not get a solution to the problem i came in with.  i don't like not knowing what's wrong with me, and not knowing if the doctor i'm about to see will be able to help or not.  
1	I think it;s the certain checkups that I have to get. They can be very uncomfortable which naturally makes me tense.

1	Well when its a cold or the flu it isn't that bad. It's when you don't know what illness you have that's really scary. When you have this unexplained pain that doesn't go away and you mistakenly look on the internet for answers towards what it may be.

-1	Waiting. Once I am back in the exam room I'm usually ok. The only other thing was expressing how bad I felt knowing it was something other than the flu or general fatigue and worry about not being able to express it because I am such a strong person that doesn't show weakness so its hard for me to really break down and let people know I feel horrible.
1	Worrying about what the doctor will say is the most worrisome. Going through checkups and tests which make me anxious. 
1	Feeling embarrassed by something that is going on with me I guess. I think I am more anxious about that than anything else.

-1	My Blood Pressure go up and I get up set it in my Stomach and I be trying to get out there and get to the house so I can relax
1	Personal history of cancer - never know when it could rear its ugly head, so always a bit uneasy when it comes to exams, particularly if I come with a physical concern.
1	When visiting the doctor's office I am usually most anxious of the pointing out all of my physical flaws. There are things I know are wrong with me, and them diagnosing it is like they are confirming it. Also it usually involves contact, and i hate people touching me.
-1	I always wonder if they will find something else wrong, besides the problem that I am there for.  I usually get a little anxious because I know that I have waited too long before going to see the doctor.
-1	When I am most anxious or worried at the doctors office is when I am having lab work done. Waiting on the lab results makes me feel anxious and worried about what the outcome will be. 
-1	As I get older I worry a little bit each time that I could have some disease that people tend to get as they get older but it hasn't happened yet.
-1	I think when I visit the doctor and have not followed my health routine, I worry that my doctor will be disappointed with me. Just yesterday, I had my 3 month diabetic check.

1	when a doctor run tests on you you dont no what to think you be thinking its bad news especially when you have surgery
1	When I sense that the doctor has their own agenda rather than responding to the patient in front of them, it makes me very anxious. When the doctor exhibits arrogant behavior or seems disrespectful, I worry that they won't really listen to me or will discount what I have to tell them. When a doctor seems to assume that every patient is displaying drug-seeking behavior, I worry that they aren't really listening and that I will not get the right treatment.

1	The uncertainty over the possibilities of what health issues could arise or be identified, not knowing what outcomes are possible and may occur.
-1	Well honestly I rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor.  The only time I can see myself being worried about my condition is when I have something that might be seriously wrong with me and it is more of a reaction to the condition than to the doctors visit itself.  I tend to be a pretty calm individual in most situations so it rarely ever comes up.  Though what exactly makes me worried more than anything is simply the possibility of a condition that can only be treated and not cured but I think that is something that bothers most people in general.
1	Finding out there is an issue when you were just there for an exam or checkup, not expecting anything negative. 
1	I do not like to go to a doctor because of the cost and wait time. This normally amplifies my anxiousness and worries.
-1	I don't get anxious when visiting the doctor
-1	I really don't have those feelings.  I guess when a new issue comes up  there might be a thought that it could be something bad and incurable but I don't dwell on things like that.
-1	I feel anxious when I do not know what is wrong or I will get test results in an area I've had no experience with in the past

-1	I think what would make me feel most anxious would be if my doctor found something wrong with me
-1	I only feel anxious if I'm sure what is wrong with me. If it's just a regular checkup I'm not worried but if I'm sick and not sure I'm slightly anxious about what it could be
-1	Nothing really. They know me so I feel comfortable around the Doctor and his staff. The only thing that makes me feel anxious is what to get mom and me for lunch.
1	I feel anxious at the doctor because I never know what they will tell me. That alone worries me. What do I have to pay for next is the question in my head.
-1	if i know something isn't right and I am waiting for results then i may get a little nervous to hear what the outcome is.  but i know all things work together for me if I trust and believe in GODS outcome for me
-1	Just the type of procedure; some are more stressful than others. Or getting too cold in the exam room while waiting or during the procedure.
-1	I would feel more anxious or worried about tests that might be take. I guess its just the uncertainy and unkown .
-1	Telling me how much I weigh. When I had surgery on my back what was explained to me was a bit frightening. 
-1	When I visit the doctor, my biggest worry is how much it will cost. I don't have very much money and my insurance is very bad. Even a little test can end up being thousands of dollars and I don't have the ability to pay it. 
-1	it is the whole  getting undressed and having a stranger look at your hoo ha. I do not get respect and the doctors do not listen
-1	What they're going to say; the fact that I have to take my clothes off; the fact that they're going to touch me
1	HAVING TO WAIT A LONG TIME AND GETTING A BAD DIAGNOSIS.  HAVING TO UNDERGO EXTREME MEDICAL ATTENTION.  DRAINING AND EXHAUSTING LIKE HAVING TO FAST BEFORE A TEST.

1	telling me that my cholestrol is high because i dont like taking the medicine she prescribed even though i have told her that i have bad side effects and my insurance will not cover the expensive medicine.

1	that i may have something that is not easy to talk through and hard for my physician to explain to me

-1	what makes me worried when i visit the doctors office is if the injury i received had gotten worse, anxious because i really want to know whats going on with me if i have and health problems 
1	The fact of what could be wrong makes me anxious.  I don't know if I have an issue that will require further medical attention.
-1	I make myself feel most anxious or worried. I'm not a fan of social interactions/situations, so the whole process of going to the doctor stresses me out.
1	I don't like going to places I'm unfamiliar with. I don't like seeing sick people. Doctors offices usually have a real sad, depressing and anxious environment and feeling. 
-1	WHEN THE DOCTOR CONTACTS ME AND ASKED ME TO COME IN UNEXPECTEDLY; OR REFUSES TO GIVE ME INFORMATION ABOUT AN ISSUE OVER THE PHONE AND INSIST THAT I COME IN
-1	I feel anxious because like I said I have cancer and it's hard to tell well with my experience I've tried 5 or 6 different medicines that has not helped the cancer my cancer has grown so yes I do feel anxious and unsettled at times
-1	I have had unexplained pain a few times and I have been nervous wondering what it could be prior to going. I felt anxious to have tests done and get results in case it was bad news. I never felt scared to speak with my doctor though.
1	As stated before I have a hard time trusting doctors. Some times they just don't listen to what you are telling them. I can't always afford to go until I have no choice.
1	The long waits. Mean nurses. And basically anything that has to do with the thought of me not understanding if I will feel better leaving. Or also, how long I will feel better once I leave. 
1	My blood pressure always goes up and they tell me it is white coat syndrome and is a common reaction.  I just worry about that and I also worry that my other vitals are out of whack.
-1	i always wonder if some new disease has infected me or if i have some sickness but just haven't noticed it before.my fears are mostly unfounded of course
-1	I'm sometimes afraid of what is wrong with me especially when it comes to woman's issues. I'm afraid she will find something severe
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried because I am inspired by the thought of having a good quality of life
1	Always wonder if they will find something wrong that I didn't notice, and if so would it be serious and expensive
-1	Getting sick from other patients. 
1	The fact that the Dr won't do the right testing to find out my problems. I need to know for my financial well being.
-1	They might find something seriously wrong.
-1	I don't tend to get anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. I think if I had a serious medical condition, the not knowing if I was going to get better or worse would make me the most anxious. I don't get nervous for annual check-ups. 
-1	I have met with my new Dr. one time and walked away confident and peaceful that he is my primary Dr. Time will tell.
1	That i will get a bad diagnosis. That i may need to have an uncomfortable procedure performed. Or maybe the amount of money needed wont be enough 
-1	Not knowing the results of lab tests or any other kind of test.  The wait for the results makes me anxious
-1	Wondering what battery of tests or measures may be necessary, whether something unplanned or unnounced will be painful or stressful.
1	I am afraid of being diagnosed with a serious illness, my blood pressure is usually up when being examined.
-1	For some reason I get anxious. But once I am in there I don't feel scared at all because my doctor makes me feel  better. Perhaps it's just the environment and anticipation that makes me scared.
1	I don't want to hear any bad news.  I just want to hear that all is well and I can go about my life.  I do not want to hear that something is worrisome and I need more tests, etc.
1	The things that make me feel most anxious when visiting a doctor's office is that they will not make the proper diagnosis and that they will not give me a good enough medication for my ailments.  How could a doctor properly diagnose everything after such quick examinations?  Also, doctors are now so worried about being sued that they will not prescribe medications with addiction potential.  These drugs have worked well for a century and now we must use inferior drugs just because some people decide to abuse the drugs.
1	I am nervous that they are going to find a major issue with my health. I am also nervous that they will miss something major with my health. 
-1	I have a general dislike for doctor appointments. This stems from when I was a child and going to the doctor with my mother who was diagnosed with leukemia. I may be a little of a hypochondriac but my docoto and his staff know that about me and provide comfort.
1	I get just anxious about seeing and being around people. I don't know what it is. Afraid of things that could happen but I know they won't. 
1	how i feel im always worried about them lying or messing up very baldy. then the cost is way to high to see them
-1	Just having to deal with answering lots of questions and getting tests, etc.
1	I am afraid i'm going to get yelled at for something I have or have not done to take care of myself.
-1	I'm scared and nervous that there will be something to show up in my examination that I will have to take more pills for a condition.  I do not like to take pills.
1	I'm always worried they're going to find a lump or something that indicates cancer or another scary disease that would change or end my life.
-1	I tend to feel anxious whenever there strangers involved, especially professiols. I tend to be anxious all the time, especially when outside of places I'm comfortable with or familiar with, and a doctor's office is the furthest thing from a comfortable space to be in. That, and I'm always paranoid that I might unintentiolly make it more difficult for the doctor to actually do their job. I tend to breathe very differently, almost as if I'm trying to keep myself from showing any potential symptoms. Plus, my self-destructive tendencies (that are caused by my depression) tend to come in the form of me denying myself help, so even I mage to get to a doctor, I feel cornered. 
1	Mainly worried they will be giving me bad news. A lot of bad diseases, cancer, heart conditions, etc, are in my family. 
-1	i do not feel anxious or worried when i visit the doctors office, i am always ready to hear whatever they have to tel me
-1	Nothing. I have confidence in my new doctor. With the old one I would be nervous that I wouldn't be taken seriously. 
1	Knowing what's wrong with me and am willing to change my behaviors. Realizing I'm human and fallible worries me to death.
-1	I am more worried that the might find something wrong with me. I don't really ever think about being sick until I go to the doctor's office. 
-1	I am not anxious or worried when visiting my doctor.  I have a lot of faith in him and I am not a bit anxious or worried.
-1	Most of my anxiety comes from the doctor feeling that I need further testing beyond what is covered by my insurance. 
-1	I am never anxious about visiting the doctors office, because I'm there for my own good. If anything is wrong with me , my doctor can find out and help me.
-1	The thing that makes me the most anxious would be going in when I know something is truly wrong with me and not having any idea of the outcome - the uncertainty can be very worrisome. 
1	I have several chronic diseases. Rest assured that complications will come up. There's always a chance of a medical problem.
1	I worry about getting bad news. I worry about being judged. I worry about appearing nervous and anxious.
1	I have to be feeling really bad to go see a doctor. Even though I know I probably have high blood pressure, I don't want to face it.
1	I feel anxious because of the waiting room and germs (I am a bit of a germophobia and am afraid I might contract an illness while waiting). I also get worried about maybe being pinpointed from the doctor if I didn't follow there instructiosn to the t
1	That something else will be wrong that would cause more tests or hospital visit and that medication isn't working properly 
-1	Finding out if I've gained or lost weight. If my blood pressure has improved. If my overall health has improved 
-1	Is the doctor spending enough time evaluating my lab results, charts and physical examination to make informed choices about my care?
1	The main thing that makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor is the fact that I have to sit right next to other people that have things that may or may not be worse than what I already have. A little more space between chairs would be sufficient in my opinion. I'm also anxious when they check for other things than what I came in for .
-1	In medicine, not everything is 100%, but very close. So naturally, when someone goes to their physician they are there for a particular reason, so I find it natural for one to feel anxious or worried because fear for the unknown. Iâm general, everyone needs to go see a doctor, for not only maintaining a healthy life, but preventing bad from occurring, and these types of feelings occur, along with excitement and pride when all comes out good. 
1	I feel anxious to leave because of the long wait and worried they will find other problems that I didn't went there for
-1	I am often worried of the things that I will learn. I feel grim or hopeless at times and my doctor is there for me. They listen, explain and let me ven't without judging in any way. I am often scared to face certain things or news, but in reality, it's life and u can get thru anything.
1	whether i will get the best solution for me
-1	I am getting older and just never know what my body is doing.i feel like my so called body clock is getting closer to its expiration date so to speak.i want to live a long life.
1	Well if I am in a doctorâs office that generally means that I am hurt or sick and I cannot take care of it on my own. So I am worried that the illness or injury is going to be worse that I feared. 
1	I'm most worried about the germs at the doctor's office and catching something from others. I don't want to get sick, even if I already am. 
-1	The battle I sometimes have to have to get them to use a manual blood pressure cuff on me instead of an automatic one.   As previously mentioned, I have severe osteoporosis due to osteogenesis imperfecta.   It is possible for the automatic one to tighten so much that it can literally fracture my arm.  Thus as the nurses' handbook for OI states, a manual blood pressure cuff should be used on folks like me.    Doctor's office staff are not used to patients coming in and insisting on the use of a manual cuff.   I don't look forward to having to go through that each time.
-1	That he will find something new to be concerned about and I will have to see other doctors and have tests to determine the best treatment for it
1	Iâm most anxious that lab results will have indicate I need some kind of medication.  I worry about my blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzymes but so far they are OK. 
-1	I get a little nervous about judgement maybe. Like they'll think Im a hypochondriac if I tell them everything I need help with. I don't like the smell of the place, that alcohol smell. I don't like people touching me. I don't like how you're shoved around like cattle into different rooms. I don't like the front office at doctor's office, they are usually cold and sterile. Just say hello to a patient would be nice. LOL
-1	If the doctor is not organized or does not have a clear plan, I get anxious.  If the doctor is unable to answer my questions or come up with a credible plan, I look for another doctor.
-1	I rarely am anxious or worried when I visit my doctor's office because I am confident that he will be able to successfully address my medical issues.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctorâs office is the same thing I just stated in the prior narrative, is that I am concerned that physicians are primarily in the drug business and always looking to push drugs. I know that pharmaceutical companies incentivize physicians to prescribe drugs for pretty much everything and so I always fear that there is a âwitch huntâ in progress as a physician to look for reasons to prescribe and considers which drugs to use.
-1	When you go you don't know what the doctor is going to say. So you might be worried or  anxious.And you hart might be raceing.
-1	The wait time either in the waiting room or exam room. I hate waiting on anything or anyone. So, it stresses me to do that. 
1	I am worried about what might be wrong with me.  I worry that it might be really serious.
1	I'm and anxious and worried that I may have a fatal disease. Also, my blood pressure always rises when she first comes into the room. She says it's a phenom called white coat syndrome. I also hate having my weight taken because I am fearful that I have gained too many pounds and will have to go on a diet. 
1	I have a slight fear about needles and not a lot of tolerance with pain. I always have a feeling that if I have to go see a doctor I will need to have needles stuck in me and that makes me nervous. Also, doctors' offices and environments are often unpleasant and do not help one feel more at ease.
1	I almost always feel skeptical that I will get any good answers and it makes me feel worried that I will never find an answer.
-1	I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I have symptoms, or am suffering from an illness and have no idea what it is.  If my symptoms are extreme, sometimes I'm anxious or worried.
1	Taking off my clothes and having a check up makes me anxious and worried. I do not like a doctor that does not listen and hurries through the appointment so he or she can go on to the next patient. It makes me anxious when the doctor does not take time with me. I ask alot of questions. 
1	I get judged a lot.  My chronic condition involved weight gain.  I often feel the doctors see only the weight gain and not the person  
-1	It's just something I don't like doing, even though I completely trust my doctor.  I think most people don't want to visit the doctor.
-1	What on result for blood test to see if anything is wrong. Or when I dont feel good and have to wait for CT scan or MRI result to see if their is a problem. 
-1	I'm in good health so I am never nervous about seeing my doctor. I go once a year for a check-up. The only thing that bothers me is the blood draw that he orders each time, this is needed to monitor my PSA because of a previous cancer diagnosis.  I also don't care much for the colonoscopy I must endure every three years.
1	My blood pressure usually rises when I see my doctor, and I haven't yet had a full physical exam despite using him for about a year. He does not seem thorough.
1	The fact that my GP doesn't listen to me.  And the fear that they find something wrong, I dont go to the doctor unless i need a physical or it is for an illness
1	I never know if she's trying to give me meds that she pushes on other people and not really help me since she doesn't pay attention to me 
1	When I visit a Doctor's office, it is because I am already showing symptoms of something that has not gone away on its own. As a result, I am already worried prior to the visit, as if it doesn't go away on its own, it may be serious.
-1	I've never experienced feeling anxious or worried going to the doctor's office. However for others, it might be the worry of what the doctor may tell or reveal to them concerning their health.
-1	When I really don't know what is wrong with me and something I see my doctor who is telling me something I know is wrong. I have never asked for a secomd opintion, but I think I will.
-1	I think most anxiety/worries just come from not knowing what is going to happen
-1	"I have been ill for 20 years. In the first couple of years of my illness, those adjectivesâ described me to a ""T"". Not now. Fear rule those emotions. I am on dialysis... I don't have time for that. Plus, I have the best doctor in the world. My appointment with her is not so ""medical""...It is friendly, upbeat and informative."
1	You just never know what is going to be found out. I have a lot of iffy family history that makes me nervous so I always dread going to the doctor
-1	Very anxious and worried about test results, drawing blood, health issues I don't know about. I am very uneasy when it comes to needles so I hate getting them
1	I feel worried or anxious when going to the doctor because I don't want them to find anything wrong. I always go in hoping for the best but expecting the worst
-1	The possibility of receiving bad news is one thing, but honestly it doesn't make me too worried.  If I receive news about a condition, I am then empowered to do something about it.  The only other thing I can think of that makes me anxious is thinking about the bill I'm going to receive later.
-1	Nothing really, but i hate those wait times. Ridiculous i have to wait almost an hour just to see my doctor. I will be finding another clinic soon for better wait times
-1	I might feel anxious and worried if I have done a lot of research and self diagnosis of my symptoms and fear the worse
1	I worry that I'll learn that something is seriously wrong with me, or that my doctor will miss something important when examining me.
1	I feel like I know what their going to say.  Also it makes me nervous as there maybe something wrond even when there isn't.
1	My doctor will question me about steps she recommended and prescriptions that were written that I did not follow or didi not follow reliably
1	When I go for my yearly exam and it involves female stuff I hate it. It is uncomfortable for the patient and for the Doctor. Plus it is somewhat painful. Then there is the breast exam. I don't like anyone seeing me undressed much less touching me in a private area. I am always so relieved when it is over and I am walking out all dressed!
1	Like I said, I think I'm a kind of hypochondriac. It's very easy to convince myself I have any disease I hear of, and so I just want to avoid the whole situation, like going to the doctor will make it worse. Also, I've had really bad experiences with doctors mistreating my family members.
1	Nothing makes me feel anxious more than just having to wait in the waiting room. It seem unnecessary to have an appointment at a certain time then be force to wait another 30 minutes or so. Can be very frustrating when they do this at the office. I get anxious because I could have been doing better things with my time then spending it at a waiting room. This waiting time feeds into my anxiety, but most of the time I feel like I am in the clear, and have no issues I should be worried about since I get tested every three months.
1	What makes me anxious when the doctors is finding out whats wrong with me getting the diagnosis.Thats the big thing!
-1	I do not feel any of this
-1	I fear the response of the doctor if I did not meet the goals he set for me at the last visit. I know that if I put the effort forth I would meet those goals.
-1	I'm generally worried about my condition. Or the news they'll give me. Or some intrusive test.
1	I am always nervous that something will be wrong with me. I get nervous sitting in the waiting room because I imagine whatever symptoms I am experiencing could be a serious illness. I worry about the doctor not saying much because they get concerned while examining me.
-1	Not knowing what my illness is, or what the treatment will be, what medication will be prescribed and what if any side effects may possibly experience. 
-1	I am not anxious or worried when visiting a doctor's office or hospital.  Routine examinations or lab work are exactly that - routine; the results of which, no matter the outcome, are to be reviewed, discussed, and plan of action implemented.
1	I feel anxious about what the problem may be, what the treatment options would be, and any recovery time. I worry about my blood pressure, heart rate, and weight, even though I've never had problem with any of those three. The thing that makes me most nervous is trying to explain to the doctor my illness or pain. I always feel like I'm being judged and I can't explain myself well enough.
-1	Sometimes the ameba what I feel developing conditions and I am not sure what the results of the examination will be until it is complete.  
-1	If I go in for something embarrassing and/or unpleasant. If I happen to have waited a little to long before I went to the Dr because I thought the problem would go away and didn't want to hear any bad news. 
1	I had a cancer scare and it always worries me that I might actually be diagnosed with cancer. That's the only thing that really makes me anxious. 
-1	The only time I feel anxious or worried is when I think something is wrong with me.  Overall, I feel safe because I am at a doctor's office.
-1	Sometimes I get nervous and scared that I am going to get really bad news. It worries me. It's mainly fear that bothers me the most. 
-1	I'm not anxious or worried when visiting the doctor. I have nothing to fear no matter what happens there
1	They want to make a healthy person sick by prescribing unnecessary tests and procedures to charge a huge bill, also lacking skills and giving incorrect diagnosis.
1	"My doctor is a part of the LDS Church, and I am too, but not ""active."" He is a high council member in the Church and has pressured me and tells me I need to go to my Ward (or church). I can't make this stuff up. I felt it stepped over the line or patient/physician relationship. It make me really anxious to go to another appt with him because I knew he would know I haven't been to church, or paid tithing, etc."
1	My biggest fear is to find out that something is seriously wrong with me. It never happens but it is a lingering feeling that I have when I'm in the doctor's office. 
1	I feel anxious because I don't like going to the doctor anyway and I don't like to receive ad news. I hate this because even though I may be in good health that doesn't mesn anything. It just scares me even though nothing is probably wrong with me.
1	It depends on the doctor and the reason for the visit. If I have to go to the gynecologist, it's stressful due to the extreme invasion of privacy. I'm normally not anxious when going to my primary care doctor, unless I have to provide a blood sample. I have an extreme fear of needles.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctor. 
-1	I am most anxious when there's a time that the doctor takes a long time giving me a diagnosis of my condition one time, for some reason it made me very worried and fortunately, the results were not bad compared to what I was imagining.
1	it could be good news or bad. you already have been waiting anywhere for a month or two for test results, so yes i want to know test results.
-1	Anxious for the results of health issues and treatment plan. Worried how health issues may be impacted by new treatment plan and medication 
-1	I was worried I would have to have a lot of tests I couldn't afford to figure out what was wrong with me.
1	What makes me feel most anxious when visiting a doctor is when I just got back from doing a lab and my results are in.
-1	There is nothing in particular that makes me feel anxious or worried. I was anxious when finding out the sex of my baby.
1	Just afraid that they will find something that is not good. I haven't really taken care of my body from like 12 to 22 using heroin and doing whatever drugs I could get my hands on. Just the past three years I got my life otgether and my health is phenomonal. But I am worried I will have something go wrong with my brain because I have had two traumatic brain injuries. I don't want the doctor to tell me I have brain cancer
1	The only thing I'll be anxious about trying to see if I have concocted a new disease or anything like that other than that I'm really not too anxious when I'm at the doctor's office
1	I'm anxious that he might find something unhealthy or that I may have to be put on more medication for a condition I didn't know anything about
-1	im usally scare of what they are going to tell me. i hope every time i go to their office i hear good news.
-1	I don't feel anxious or worried. I never stated that i did. My response to the question was  strongly disagree.
1	Trying to balance the mental processes of analyzing what the doctor instructs/suggests, incorporating this information into my current plans/goals, and evaluating the reliability/ likelihood for bias of said information.
-1	As I become older, I worry that there will be health conditions that will compromise my life experiences.  I worry that I will no longer be able to live the life I want
-1	JUST NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT I'M GOING TO HEAR ABOUT MY CONDITION, SOME UNEXPECTED NEWS I MAY HAVE TO DEAL WITH
-1	I have never felt anxious or worried when going to the doctor's office. The reason is because, since I have been going to him for so long, I know what to expect. The two times I was diagnosed with cancer, his receptionist would call me to make an appointment so he could he tell me in person. I always appreciated that.
-1	I've never been worried a doctors visit unfortunately I may have been impatient while waiting to be seen
1	The amount of pain expected from some medical procedures is a cause of worry. Also, being told that there could be an abnormality in some test results. The cost of the visit or tests needed is also bothersome.
1	it all depends on the reason why I am going to the doctor in the first place. I worry if she will actually listen and understand what the issue is
1	having my blood pressure checked makes me nervous. I am already taking three medications to control it and do not want to add any more.
-1	more worried if i need to wait a long time and then doctor spend a few minutes for me don't lisen me carefully and don't want to understand my problem
1	The intimacy of some tests. Pap smears are generally painful; don't look forward to those. And at age 59, I'm running into problems I never thought about at younger ages, like changes in cholesterol and bone density. So even though I'm in pretty good health, at the very least, I have to wonder what fresh age-related disease I'll be at risk of next.
-1	The thing that makes me feel the most worried is thinking about how long the waiting is going to be. I cannot stand to be kept waiting.
-1	Finding out I have a potentially life threatning disease such as cancer.  Especially when you thought it was something else like a spider bite.
1	I am anxious and worried when I visit the doctors office because I am worried that he will find something seriously wrong with me. 
1	I always feel like they are not looking at serious underlying conditions that are not so obvious.  They never seem to want to do any tests that would uncover internal issues.
-1	only if a serious problem might be existing and I'd have to have drastic action done, like surgery. or a chance of cancer perhaps.
1	I generally am uncomfortable around doctors and downright panicky around dentists.  I think this is all due to bad experiences as a child that I just cannot seem to get over.
-1	I feel most worried when I have to go get labs done and waiting for the lab results can be worrisome.
-1	The possibility of finding something I don't want hear.
1	that there is something seriously wrong.. 
-1	I just worry that something could be wrong even though I know there's little chance of that being the case.
-1	Not knowing if he has something bad to tell me or I might be hospitalized for some reason or another 
1	I'm very missed it if it goes away or something it will probably go away and i'll be stuck with nothing again
1	I'm anxious that they're going to make me wait a long while before seeing the doctor.  I'm worried that when I am seen by the doctor, it's going to be a waste of time and they're not going to have any answers.
-1	If I have an ailment, I'm most worried about how much time and cost I will have to dedicate to having it treated.
-1	I have not been with this doctor for an extended period f time. I need to spend a little more time underneath the care of this particular provider, in order to have complete faith in them.
-1	Now that I am 64 I cannot help but worry about what the doctor may find; if there is some condition or clue that I am not even aware about, but may lead me down a serious path of health treatments and expenses. I think I am actually more worried about the possible fincial consequences than the physical discomfort.
1	The final diagnosis I may receive  when all the examinations and physicals are concluded.  I will be hoping that it will result in a good report.
1	You are always a bit on edge hoping that you won't find out you have a terrible illness. I feel like I don't know my doctor anymore so it's very impersol and makes you feel a bit awkward in telling someone so much about you. I also feel like there isn't enough time to be told things in detail.
-1	
-1	Finding out that my I might have inherited a health problem from a family member during a check up or analysis, that is always a major concern and cause for nervousness when booking a check up.
-1	I don't know. Nothing really. If I have a concern that I think something is really bad, I would probably be nervous. If I had no idea what was going on with my health.
-1	I sometimes feel anxious that I will be waiting in the exam room forever, especially when I have other plans after the appointment.
-1	I am just generally an anxious person. I do not like going to the doctor, especially if I know it will involve a blood draw. I do not do well around blood or needles. 
-1	I always feel anxious hoping the doctor finds me in good health when I go to my appointments never am I worried know I am in good hands
-1	I worry That he will find something wrong.  also I hate being weighted because I am overweight. Don't like getting undressed.
1	Test results. I have a few issues with my blood sugar and A1C, so I'm always a little anxious about what they will say about my sugars and my weight. I do not want to have insulin at any point in my life, so I've been working on controlling sugars without it. Sometimes I succeed, but not always. And a lot of doctors don't approve of the diet I'm using(ketogenic), unless they have a higher understanding of nutrition.
1	Overall uncertainty of what may transpire.  While I feel fine and have no known health issues there is always a bit of apprehension.
1	Even if I feel healthy, I get worried that there is something wrong. Also, I don't visit the doctor often so I get anxious about being in an unfamiliar place. Since it is so far between times I visit a doctor I get worried that I waited too long for them to diagnose.
1	I do not reel anxious or worried when I visit my Doctor because she will tell me if there is something wrong immediately
-1	I don't usually ever feel anxious or worried when I go to my doctor. For the most part everything is usually fine. The only time I may get worried is if something is really wrong with me. 
1	Nothing make me feel most anxious or worried going to the doctor. I like going to my door. My doctor happy every time I come to my appts.
-1	Waiting for him to come into the room.   What he will say about my diabetes.  What he will say about my weight.  Just problems in general.
-1	I have been diagnosed with several new health problems in the past few years, so now when I go for a check-up I often wonder if they will find something else wrong with me.
1	I'm most worried when I visit my doctor because I don't know what the outcomes might be. It's a little nerve-wracking when a simple blood test can change your life.
1	what makes me feel anxious and worried when going to the doctor is what they are going to dignoise me with
-1	I get anxious a lot it is part of my makeup I take medication for this when I go to the doctors office you have to wait in the waiting room full of people
-1	That something might be wrong.
-1	My doctor's office has always been very kind and welcoming. The only things that can make me feel anxious at my doctors office are the financial and insurance aspects of my visit. Even then the people there are always understanding and willing to try and accommodate my every need.
-1	I feel anxious or worried about germs when visiting a medical doctors office or a medical facility when I have to.
-1	I feel anxoius or worried when I visit a new doctor or can tell that the doctor is not as knowledgeable about my specific condition. I have a lot of autoimmune conditions that go hand in hand and each one can affect another but if a doctor only focuses on one, he may miss something. I require experienced doctors and am more reluctant to try a treatment proposed by an less experienced doctor.
1	I don't know what they are going to do to me, if something will be painful, or what the results of any tests might be. I tend to not think about my health too much but then when I go to the doctor suddenly I have to deal with it all
1	That they are going to tell me that something is seriously wrong with me. Not really anything in particular but that something will require some surgery or a massive change in lifestyle. I always think about having cancer, or how scared I would be if I had to undergo a major surgery. If I'm going in for say blood tests, I'm going to worry that my blood tests are going to show that I have major health issues, etc. I still always have these worries and fears, despite the fact that I've yet to have anything like that occur. It's always something minor, but I always am terrified of something major.
1	I AM MOST ANXIOUS WHEN I GO TO THE GYNECOLOGIST.  JUST TOO MANY WOMEN WITH SOME FORM OF FEMALE CANCER. 
-1	The only thing that makes me feel anxious. Is I had surgery for female reproductive problems. The surgery has a 40% failure rate and I go the doctor every 6 months to see if the procedure is still holding or not. That can be a little disconcerting because if it fails I have to have another surgery.
-1	I was only anxious of what the outcome of my diagnosis could be. The doctor was asking questions, and I was thinking the worst.
1	having something that is really wrong and that there wont be a cure for it and knowing that i would have to live with having that diesease to live with the rest of my life and not being able to cure it 
1	I'm most anxious when visiting because of the cost and they always find something wrong with you. I'm pretty healthy so other than that I have no issues 
1	i am constantly feeling anxious about a lot of things. mostly because i just can't help it. its just something that i feel a lot. i dont know why 
1	I am overweight and I feel I will be judged. I also am afraid I will not know the right questions to ask the doctor.
1	I do not enjoy others looking at my nakedness. I do fear sometimes that the doctor could find something I'm not aware of.
-1	im always  worry if i find out bad news at the doctors office sometimes i just dont feel like going 
1	I am not sure what he is telling me is the truth about my health. Doctors may sometimes tell you the wrong thing about your body because he does not examine you but ask you questions that may not have anything to do with your condition.
-1	Whenever you feel something out of the ordinary, you think about it until it is diagnosed, and that would make any normal person a bit anxious...
1	I have anxiety so just going to meet with someone I do not know well in a public place automatically causes me to feel anxious and worried. Couple that with it relating to my health it is more severe.
-1	I don't have much fear or worry when I go to the doctor. I used to, before I started trusting Jesus. Now that I do trust Jesus, I give all my worries and concerns to him. I just go to the doctor for checkups, and I deal with whatever is said the best way I can.
1	I am an anxious person to begin with, so waiting in a public area with other people is already nerve wracking on it's own. I also have trouble talking with people I know well about my problems, so the idea of divulging intimate physical problems makes me very nervous.
1	I usually get anxious or worried about the doctor telling me bad news, the doctor finding something serious. 
1	I'm scared they will say my conditions have worsened or that something new has come up. Or that I have done something wrong. 
1	The impending case of my pain, or if I may have something I do not know about. 
-1	I have no control of what a doctor is going to find when I go for an exam. As long as I know that I am doing the right things regarding my health then there's nothing to worry about
1	I just do not like to go the doctor. I worry that the doctor might find something that is wrong or tell me something that I do not want to hear. I worry that my test results might not bge good.
-1	I have had a serious condition in the past. It's not the doctor it's what she might find.
-1	the possibility of the doctor discovering something i was unaware. while it's good they are able to identify anything which needs to be addressed, i'm obviously hoping that i leave the doctor with a clean bill of health. i'm always worried that this will not be the case. 
-1	I have no problem visiting the doctor's office. Other than the occasiol...I have absolutely no bedside manner doctor, I find doctors very accommodating. I however, hate Pap smears. Unless you've had one you can't possibly understand. So...no problems with going for physical other than pap and a small aversion to needles.
-1	I feel afraid that the doctor won't have enough time for me, or he'll brush off my questions. Those are my two biggest concerns when I go to the doctor. I don't like my opinion to be brushed off or disregarded, and I hate feeling as though my concerns don't matter. It also makes me really anxious that I wait 45 minutes to see a doctor and then the overall appointment takes only 90 seconds. It just makes me feel really worried that I'm not getting the care or attention that I should be. 
1	I am working hard to improve my health and I always get worried that my tests will show that I have regressed in my work.  I also worry that at some point it may come back and tell me that I have developed a serious health issue that will require lifestyle changes.
-1	I'm not really sure what makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office.  Maybe it's the feeling of not being 'perfect' - not eating well enough, not having the perfect weight, not having the perfect blood pressure, etc. - and it seems that the doctor is always finding fault with something.
-1	Honestly the most anxious I get is over getting shots. I know they're important but they trigger a phobia in me and it makes me very uneasy to deal with it. 
1	The thing that makes me the most anxious and is not knowing whether or not I am ill. I always fear that I would be sick and even though I would rather know right away the uncertainty makes me anxious. 
-1	I am comfortable at the doctors office now that I have a doctor that I am confident in. Having a Dr who wont listen to me or who dismisses my symptomology is what makes me most uncomfortable at the dr
1	The fact that I might have something wrong with me but they will not notice it or even care to do a follow up on it. Also I can sense their lack of caring and that troubles me a lot as well.
-1	I worry about a lot of things but some are not able to fix or do anything about the doctor does what he can
1	The only time I feel this way is when I am not sure what is wrong with me or just want to make sure everything is right when I go for my diagnosis. 
1	i feel anxious or worried because i dont know what the out come of why i am there is going to be whether i am goimng to find out something worse
1	As I get older, I feel more aches and pains.  It bothers me when I do not know why some parts of my body hurt more than others.  I want to know what is wrong with me, but at the same time, I worry that she will tell me my  condition is  more serious that I anticipated
-1	What worries me is the chance of the doctor needing some lab work done due to my phobia of needles and what the doctor might say about what is wrong with me at the moment.
1	I just have overall anxiety issues stemming from my bout with depression.  I suffer from depression and experience extreme highs and lows.
-1	The time necessary to identify and appropriately mage health issues sometimes worries me, as I do not feel that I can trust my PCP or any other single doctor individually.   I have had too many bad experiences in maging my own care, and that of various family members.
1	I'm worried that I have not lost any weight or even gained weight. I'm concerned about my blood sugar possibly rising higher.
-1	I worry that I will get sick from other people there.  I worry that I will hold the doctors back with my long appointments. I worry that my insurance will not cover something.
-1	I really don't like being touched by strangers. Even though I have been to my primary care doctor it still feels like being touched by a stranger.
1	I don't like being at a doctor's office because I have better things to do than be told the obvious. If I'm really sick then I go.
1	The thing that makes me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit the doctor is the fact that I might have a medical condition that will cost a lot of money to cure or a long time.
1	It will allways be tue same way of life it will never come back it will be there first real world is the not to do it away. It at least twice in one place. It fun with you guys doing today, early on the group is not an easy one for you and ur a good idea time for the black the group.
1	even when I think I feel fine, am concerned that the MD will find something that I didn't know about, or worse yet, tell me to do something/treatment I am uncomfortable about doing
1	Money! Everything is so expensive. It's so expensive and I've got what I like to call health anxiety. I always think it's going to be the worst thing ever.
1	When I go to my doctor's office for a check up, I am always anxious that my blood tests will show that something is wrong. I tested in the pre-diabetic range last time I went, so this is a worry for me right now.
1	There is an element of wanting to stay healthy and be on track.  Thoughts might go to the measures you've taken such as exercise and diet to stay healthy.  Have these been adequate or is more required, and will you now be able to accomplish what will be asked of you?
1	I am always concerned that it will be found that I have developed a serious condition that will be expensive and/or life threatening.
-1	I worry about being lectured about my health and also having to go through the whole procedure of tests. I don't like it.
1	I feel most anxious or worried at a doctors office wondering if they will listen without being brushed off or ridiculed. They tend to be dismissive when realizing I am not able to tolerate medicine, and rather than researching to find the root cause I often feel brushed off or abandoned. I get anxious or worried because I'm obviously visiting the office for a valid reason and wish they would take a moment and try to help find or recommend an altertive solution. 
-1	You don't know what to expect after and examination. They could diagnose you with something you didn't know you had.
1	When i go to the doctor for various symptoms I am anxious that whatever is going on with me might be some life threatening disease and not something simple that can be easily fixed. 
-1	Nothing at all need to find a facility that provide transportation back to the doctor's office and find a doctors that help me .
1	i want to live forever with no health concerns! I become anxious when it looks like something will challenge that -- how will this medical news change my life, change my finances, change my ability to keep my committments, change my appearance, debilitate me, etc etc etc. These fears make me anxious or worried.
-1	I get anxious sometimes if they have to do a physical on me and if they have to touch me it's the only thing I get worried about.
1	That staff will be rude or mean. That I will have a condition
1	I think it's just fear of the unknown. I wonder whether I've developed some type of illness since my last visit, and let that fear take me to some dark places.
1	Other than the fact that ever thing I walk by is scanned and I get charged for equipment that won't even be used by me, what makes me most anxious is the fact that a trained professional will know what's wrong with me, have the resources and know-how to help, but won't because I don't belong to a certain tax bracket. 
-1	About how uncomfortable I'm going to be if they touch me entirely the wrong way. That's mostly it because I don't like being touched inappropriately 
1	Normally I am concerned, like most, that my doctor could find something seriously wrong with me. My mother passed of lupus, and my father just recovered from colon cancer, so I am concerned that it's only a matter of time that I am diagnosed with a life threatening aliment. 
1	the uncertainty of whats wrong with me, and if they can fix it and HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
-1	i really don't feel anxious or worried while visiting the doctor's office i'm in good enough health at my age
-1	I don't feel upset or worried when seeing my doctor I actually look forward to seeing her and making sure my care is on point
-1	I'm 63 years old. Eventually I'm going to be the recipient of bad news regarding my health. That's the only reason I ave to be apprehensive.
-1	Mostly I worry if my health is improving or backsliding. I have a silly worry that he will find some horrible disease or something. I mean, not really, but kind of if that makes sense. I also don't like getting shots. Or the backside exam.
-1	That my doctor won't be able to find out what is going on with my health. That there won't be an answer or that it will take forever to get an answer
1	I just have horrible white coat syndrome. We went to the doctor when we were little only if we were terribly ill. I think as a result, I have a profound fear of all medical surroundings. 
1	I have several health issues as well as my family does, so I'm always concerned my health has gotten worse or I've developed a new health problem.
1	I feel anxious or worried that I may find ou bad news. I worry that some of my bad habits may have caught up with me. I am concerned I will receive bad test results 
1	"My specialists never talk about nutrition.  The treatment options always include perscriptions or medical procedures.  Health alternatives are never mentioned.  I know from experience that diet and exercise can change the need for harmful meds and procedures.  This worries me that doctors do not take ""the whole being"" into perspective when talking about healing."
1	My history is long, and results from an accident many years back. The accident was serious and my injuries very severe. I continually deal with residual complications from that accident and also tend to develop new conditions as time goes on and I get older. Its almost impossible for me at this point to not have anxiety after my checkups.
1	I am afraid that he will find something really wrong with me like cancer or something.  Iâve never had anything like that and am in good health but am always afraid when I go to the doctor just for a checkup they will find something like that.
-1	
1	Another appointment with nothing getting done and feeling the same or worse when i leave the doctors office.   They said surgery wont help me but wont give me anything that helps make me comfortable.  
1	There is always the worry that there might be something wrong and it does make me nervous at times so that is why going to the doctor can make me anxious
1	im worried about cost. i dont want to go to the doctor because it's expensive. thus, when i do go, I'm worried about what he will find and what it will cost.
-1	If I have to get naked or show my crotch that makes me the most nervous.  If I have to get blood drawn that will also make me a bit nervous as I am not a big fan of needles.  My biggest hesitation when seeing a dr. is how much the treatment is going to cost.
-1	always feel this way no specific reason as to why I feel this way when making a visit to my doctors office it may be this is just a natural feeling for me
-1	When they are in a bad mood. They have a facial expression of someone angry and mad at the world.
-1	When I am being given shots. Since I was a child I have had a phobia of needles and do not enjoy when I need one. I understand they are important, but I still don't like them.  
1	I get worried they won't be nice. I worry that they might look down on me. I worry that they might try to make me fearful. I've experienced this with some doctors. I've also had ones that don't listen and act annoyed when I ask simple questions. This is what I worry about.
-1	The waiting period is difficult. It is hard to sit there and wait for the doctor
-1	The fear of hearing some kind of bad news. Even if it's just a routine check-up, I'm always fearing the worst in terms of hearing bad news. The entire atmosphere at a doctor's office gives me that vibe. 
-1	Haven't lost weight. She recommended tat I do so. I began to do so, then my weight seemed to set at a certain weight.  Feel like I can't. 
1	Because nothing has been solved and my dr sometimes feels like they aren't listening to me. I have done test after test and still can't find out what's wrong with me and i feel like they are thinking it's in my head.
-1	Just that something might go wrong or something is wrong with my health.                  It puts me on edge sometimes
1	it makes me most anxious and worried that they may find something wrong or yell at me about weight, lifestyle, etc
1	Who I'm going to get. What their general attitude is. How much it's going to cost. Why they think they have to run a bunch of tests.
-1	I don't often feel anxious or worried about going to the doctor.  The only thing that might make me uneasy is the possibility of them discovering I had a life threatening illness.
-1	What i am going to ne told about my health overall or a certain condition i have. Also about blood being drawn or having to take test which require fasting or drinking certain liquids
1	I might worry that the physician sees something I wasn't aware of. I hope I don't have cancer or thoughts like that.
1	Because I am a smoker I worry if there could be something my doctor will find.  Also I know that in the future I will have to have some kind of major surgery, I am hoping that medication will prevent that from happening.
1	i think it's the fear of finding out you have some sort of illness / disease that you weren't aware of before. i am especially nervous about blood test results
-1	I guess just knowing that I didn't hit the weight goal that I had for myself. I gained weight while I was pregnant and haven't completely lost all of that weight.
-1	You always worry about what they are going to find on exam.  Even going to the dentist or having a preemployment physical makes me a little anxious 
-1	i don't have these feelings at the DR's . I always feel comfortable there because we have a high level of mutual trust.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor. 
-1	I just am always curious what is going on with my body and I am hopeful that it isn't too serious. I don't know what they are planning once I get into the exam room. So, this sense of unease leads to some anxiety.
1	Since I don't have a primary physician I worry about the quality of care I receive when going to the hospital.
-1	WHEN AM NOT SURE OF PROCEDURES AND FEEL THAT AM REALLY ILL. I MOST ALWAYS DO NOT WANT TO BE REFERED TO ANOTHER SOURCE
1	I'm always concerned that there might be some hidden condition that I am uware of that the doctor will find on a visit. I also dislike any sort of pain or discomfort during an examition. The worst part for me is waiting alone in the exam room before he comes in - my imagition is working overtime at that point.
-1	I am never worried when visiting a doctor`s office because the Veterans Hospital has the best Doctors and Nurses
1	I'm worried they will find something worse than the problem I went in for. You go in thinking something may be fixed with medication then could find out it's really a life altering condition.
-1	Being diagnosed with cancer would have to be my number one worry, even though I have never been diagnosed with it before, its just a really worry for me, and I do things in my life to try to avoid this diagnosis.
-1	Not much, usually. If I have to discuss an embarrassing issue I could be nervous, maybe. 
1	I always am worried about what is going on with me or if she will find something out that I don't know about.  I feel horribel getting on the scale and am embarrassed 
-1	Nothing , I selected nothing on the survey because it's true. I feel calm and fine in the doctors office. I have never been through a real medical scare to make me feel otherwise. 
1	they don't explain what they think is wrong with me.  they just want to run more and more tests that i can't afford.
1	The thought that something might be terribly wrong with me
-1	I feel anxious going in for blood work, and while waiting for the test results for cholesterol or diabetes.  I fear the lifestyle changes that may result from bad results.
-1	If I have to go to the doctor then it is for a good reason as I would not go otherwise so I am always a little bit concerned about what the outcome will be
1	finding something else wrong
1	I'm afraid that my doctor is going to mess with my medications because they try that every few years.  I am concerned I am going to walk out with referrals to a bunch more doctors and/or more unnecessary testing.  
1	I am worried that they will find something bad and that I will have to have major treatments to fix it.
-1	The only time i feel anxious is when i go for my annual mammogram.  Now that i get the digital kind its not as bad. I still get some anxiety. Any other time i go to dr i feel no anxiety. 
-1	I don't really feel anxious or worried in general, unless I feel that I have a pretty serious health event
-1	Nothing worries me about a doctor's visit. I can go with the flow with everything that happens. They are doing their job. I know what to expect and nothing they do bothers me in any way.
1	when I go to the doctor and I have something wrong with me I feel anxious and worried that the doctor will tell me I have something seriously wrong with me
1	What makes me feel anxious or worried is the dr. Finding something wrong. Also when you go the dr. And they find something wrong and sometimes you have to take test and waiting for the results is the worst part when you don't know what to expect.
-1	It is simply that factor of uncertainty. Even if you feel healthy you can never truly know if there is something wrong that can't be seen or felt. You always want to hear that you are healthy but you can't know if they are going to find something unusual.
-1	i usually do not feel anxious.  i dont have any major problems.  If i go to the doctor it is for something minor so I do not usually worry over anything.
1	I feel anxious because I know my problems will be over looked or shoved off as not important. It makes me unhappy to be wasting my time. 
-1	Whenever I'm visiting the doctors office I feel like I tend to get the most anxious whenever I have to be weighed. I also get a little bit anxious whenever I'm sitting in the exam room and have to wait for the doctor to walk in because I just want to know what's going on with me as soon as possible and having to wait just makes me feel like I'm on pins and needles and I start to get worried that it could end up being something worse than what I'm expecting it to be that's going on with me.
-1	I worry about what he is going to say about my weight and not taking care of myself. I do the best I can but they all seem to think it is not enough 
1	I am often worried that the doctor will not have a solution for me. Often the doctor proposes a possible solution, but rarely suggests a solution that will definitely address my problem. Because my time with the doctor often feels hurried, I am worried that all of my concerns will not get addressed. I also get anxious when I have to discuss problems that are somewhat uncomfortable or may be perceived as embarrassing for me. I also hate needles, and worry about whether the doctor will recommend a blood test.
1	I have past trauma that makes me not like to be touched.
-1	As dumb as it sounds, what worries me the most is what the doctor's will find.  Kind of the concept that ignorance is bliss, if I don't go then I don't have to worry about whatever is going on in my body.  I also don't like having fasting blood draws, so if I can avoid those I generally feel a lot better.  In addition, if it's not a standard wellness visit, generally you already know there's something wrong and I worry it might be more serious than it is.
-1	I have never been anxious or worried about visiting a doctor or the office as far as I can remember.  They are generally quiet, but reserved places to go to.
1	I just don't know what problems may pop up. I usually am healthy but recently I've been feeling a lot of different stuff. 
-1	"I feel like there is a chance that something could be wrong with me and I need to brace myself for some sort of bad news. This can make me feel a little bit anxious when I see a new doctor. Sometimes I also worry that the doctor won't take me seriously because I look ""rough"". I have been pegged as ""drug seeking"" simply because of how I look. This has happened even though I am not even wanting any type of medication and I am a drug and alcohol counselor per profession."
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is that I do not know what to expect each time with my persol health and hoping that nothing is going to come up as wrong or a health issue. I also get anxious about just sitting in the waiting room and wondering what will happen when I get called into the office. 
1	I am not in as good as shape as I would like.  I don't like being ked and being fat.
-1	If i know they have to draw blood, I hate and am scared of needles, that is the only thing that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office.
-1	Never know what they are going to tell me. I have been treated as if the doc does not believe me and that is frustrating.
-1	I'm worried mostly about two things: 1) do I have a serious long term health issue that will be revealed to me? 2) If I mention minor things that are bothering me, will the doctor thing I'm wasting his/her time?
-1	
1	sometimes when he is examining me, he isn't taking to me about what he doing or finding and make me a little concerned, worried and uneasy.  
1	I sometimes feel anxious because I always think something is wrong with me and I'm afraid one day there will actually be something bad happen to me.
-1	Some of the residents at the practice I attend do not thoroughly listen to you.  Or they brush off your concerns.
-1	I am always worried they will find something serious like they did with my mother's cancer.
-1	i have a tendency to pass out sometimes so that makes me nervous even if the visit is a routine visit
-1	The fact that there is always a chance that they can tell you something is wrong with you
1	I have generalized anxiety disorder and usually am always full of anxiety even if there is nothing wrong. What makes me the most anxious is the uncertainty of each visit. I Always expect the worst in every visit thinking something is seriously wrong with me. I cannot control this fear.  
-1	When i get tests ran on me. The wait to see if you have any kind of disease or something. You get worried to know if you have anything.
1	If they say something's bad with me or talk about the chance I could have something. Knowing that they're licensed makes me king of comfortable not always 
1	they could diagnose me wrong. they could give the wrong pills. my doctor might not be in and I have to go to another doctor that might not know how to address my problem.
1	I just don't like going to the doctor. Usually the only reason to go to the doctor is for a bad reason. Unless you are having a baby.
1	I am a breast cancer survivor with circulation problems so I am anxious when I need to have office visits
1	It is mainly the fear of not getting any answers to my questions.  This as well as having my body examined by a somewhat creepy doctor who seems interested in me.
-1	When I am there for symptoms. Also the anxious feeling is there because no one taught me how to go to doctors and make appointments for myself.
-1	That something is going to be wrong with me and it will be long term and it will be too late to do anything for me because i didn't listen to the advice of my doctor 
1	My anxiety when visiting a doctor's office is pretty irratiol, but I can't deny that I feel it. It's largely because of the uncertainty of the experience. Even if I feel that I am in good health, it's possible that the doctor could tell me I am in poor health or have a condition I was uware of. Though knowing about the condition would be positive overall, it is a frightening thing. 
1	i am always worried my doctor will find something wrong with me that is serious and/or that is fatal and that to me is so scary that i feel anxious.
-1	nothing really unless I am going for a followup to a previous issue. my dr and staff is great about making you feel at ease
1	It seems that there is always no progress to my condition even though I religiously follow his advice.
1	I'm getting a permanent procedure to no longer have children and that makes me nervous I read up on this Essure and how it has to be placed and there are a lot of bad things on the internet about this so it makes me nervous to get the procedure
-1	I know there is always the chance of bad news. I do not put my self in the expectative state of mind, but I am aware of the possibility.
1	afraid they might find something, sometimes afraid to ask questions hate being in the waiting room not sure what else to type ummm
-1	We all want to avoid bad news and pain
1	I am naturally an anxious person and I worry a lot, even when there is nothing to worry about my mind just starts going and I start worrying about a lot.  So just going in to the doctor's office makes me anxious.  I will worry something horrible is wrong with me.  I am not anxious about seeing the doctor as my doctor is great.  Its just everything that goes along with it.  Mostly just the thoughts in my head.
1	the fact that people know i'm going in there, as well as letting the doctors know my body. because that sucks, i hate my body

1	I feel most anxious or worried visiting a doctor's office because I do not, in general, like going to the doctors. I go because I have to, not because I want to or believe it is important.
1	The biggest fear is that something very bad will be discovered. I worry about going for what seems like a relatively normal ache or pain and finding out I have some deadly or crippling disease. No one wants to hear their upset stomach is stomach cancer. Finances can also be worrisome. I am always nervous I will need to get expensive prescriptions or procedures I did not anticipate.
-1	That would be getting bad news that I have a terminal illness or issue. Also just the rooms and materials in the office make me very anxious.
-1	'- Although some women can see the doctor without trepidation, many women feel varying degrees of doctor visit anxiety. ... You have had a bad experience in the past, if a doctor yelled at you, scared you, or embarrassed you at some time.
1	well I am concerned he will find something wrong with me and I do not want to be put in the hospital
-1	checking my pressure.  It goes up at the Dr's office.   A Dr who treat you for past issues when you have learned how to deal with them.  One who wants to use you as a gunniepig.  One who wants to take over your life without your help.                                                            
1	I now would worry about being misdiagnosed since my Mom's experience. I would have anxiety as well. I am nervous about going to doctors now. I am nervous about bringing family members - specifically my son - to doctors or hospitals now.

1	That's they might find something or tell me something bad about me that I didn't know and have to be a shot or something 
1	The primary cause of worry is the possibility that the doctor could discover something harmful in my body. This would lead to great discomfort as well as fincial liabilities.

1	Having someone looking at me and possibly having to tell me that something is seriously wrong with me

-1	I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.

-1	As a diabetic I'm always concerned about the A1C level and that I'm doing the right things. Every day is hard with knowing what, when, and how much to eat. It's a constant struggle. And even when you're doing everything right, sometimes your body does its own thing. I don't want my diabetes to get worse.
1	I don't trust them.  I always feel like I'm taking a chance when I go to see them.  I always question whether anything that they want to do is appropriate.  I always assume that anything negative I've been told in a doctor's office is just a starting point, that verification of anything I've been told will require a lot of research on my part and possibly even a trip to another doctor (who will probably contradict the first doctor).  
-1	Nothing makes me more anxious the. To find out that something is wrong with me and I can't overcome it
1	There really isn't anything that makes me feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office I ussually psyc myself up before my appointment.
-1	Before USANA, there was Gull Laboratories. Dr. Wentz spent 20 years developing medical diagnostic test kits designed to detect infections and certain autoimmune disorders. In his experience, Dr. Wentz led to a heightened awareness of the importance of optimal nutrition in maintaining the health of human cells. This awareness, and the clear lack of advanced nutritional support in the market led to the sale of Gull Laboratories and the beginning of a new organization. In 1992, USANA was born. USANA offers its products to customers through a process called direct selling. Direct selling is a little different from what youâre probably used to seeing. Instead of selling our products at the grocery store, products are sold directly to Associates and Preferred Customers. You may ask why our business is set up this way, and the answer is centered on opportunity. USANA has always been about more than simply selling the best wellness products in the world to great peopleâwe wanted to give people the best opportunity to make their life the most successful it can be. Meaning we want people to be happy and healthy physically as well as financially. We use direct selling with the intention to help people get what they really want: freedom. Freedom to do what they want and when they want. The direct selling opportunity may not be for everyone on this planet, and thatâs OK. It doesnât need to be. We donât profess to have a quick âget richâ plan, or to have the âonly wayâ to earn a living. But we do claim the ability to give people another option to build wealth and establish financial stability, especially when they already love our product and are seeing great results. Itâs an opportunity for those looking to build their own business, but maybe wary of doing it all alone. Learn more about how to become an Associate or Preferred Customer of USANA here.

1	I just get uneasy for no reason. I don't know why, I just don't really care for going to the doctor at all.
-1	i don't really ever have that problem. to me why worry until  you have something to worry about. If and when i hear something then i will worry some until i know everything about the situation
-1	If you're sick or hurting and don't know what is going on. Especially if they have to run a lot of different tests
1	Probably that they will find something horrible. They are going to tell me i'm to fat and to quit smoking. Both are easy to say but hard to do.
1	 The thing that worries me the most is the bill I'll receive. Every passing minute I'm in that office, every procedure or drug prescribed is more money that I probably can't afford to pay even with insurance. I shouldn't have to focus on that but rather be focused on why I'm there in the first place. I seriously doubt I'm in the minority who think this way.
1	I usually only go to the doctors when I know something is really wrong. I tend to stay away from the doctors for simple things like a head cold or a cough or something. I'm usually worried because I know that it could be something really serious.
-1	I hate the blood pressure cuff. I always get really nervous when they put the cuff on me and I have to sit there while my blood pressure gets taken. Because I get so nervous, my reading is very high.
-1	Probably just the blood tests I have to take.  They changed people and the new people aren't very good at making it quick and painless.
1	"I feel most anxious about the ""what ifs"". What if something were wrong, or something was gong to happen medically. I often get anxious about my interactions with a professiol, I am not a ""people"" person."
1	I do not feel that anxious or worried most of the time. But sometimes, I feel anxious which I think is very normal. I usually feel anxious or worried if the symptoms is something new. I am especially worried if I have my exams coming soon. I get worried about how long will I be sick, missing important class, not being able to do well in the class. Sometimes I get worried if the disease will last for a long time.
-1	Always anxious when I go to any doctor, dentist or hospital.  Never know how long it is going to take or how much I will have to pay for all visits and medications. Medicare is not that great for healthcare.
1	I am terribly afraid of needles. Ever since I got my blood drawn for some tests earlier in this year, I realized that it hurt me so much that I was just afraid from then on of doctors And the whole nine
-1	There is always fear of the unknown. I have never known my Dr to put me off or not act in a caring manner.  She is spot on in her diagnosis.

-1	I DONT LIKE TO HAVE A FINGER STUCK UP MY BUTT

-1	I am a senior citizen, when a history of cancer, and family history of heart disease and cancer.  I am always aware of those factors when I visit my Dr. 
-1	Anytime you enter a doctor's office for an ailment it's always nerve wracking. You do not know what's wrong, and for me being in the medical field I always think of the worst conditions. It's almost like the people that google their symptoms and freak out. It's definitely harder waiting for test results knowing what's out there and how many people you file claims for that actually have these ailments. It makes you very uneasy. The anticipation is very unnerving.  
1	In general in the doctor's office the local is too seriuos and cold. all is scary and the doctors are  intimidantes people.
-1	Its the waiting in a crowded room.
-1	When I go into get my blood drawn, it makes me a little anxious that I will not get light headed. And get pale
1	nothing.I don't get anxious or worried when visiting my dr.unless there is a new symptom involved.Then I'm only worried or anxious during the first exam s
1	Blood work mostly, procedures that could go wrong, not really listening to me. The whole thing is a stressor.
-1	Thinking that he will find something that is wrong that I didn't know about. That there will be something major that will affect my life.
-1	I feel most anxious when I have to get a vaccines and or have to get my weight checked. I am not worried about my physicians ability to examine I am worried about what they find when they examine me 
1	not wanting to be there in the first place and worried that he will want to add on more medicine that i do not want to take
-1	What makes me anxious is the possible feedback or diagnosis the doctor may tell me. My family has had a lot of medical issues. 
-1	I typically am not worried when I go to see the doctor as I am ready to face any medical condition I might have. I don't particularly look forward to prostate exams during my annual physical I guess.
-1	Anxious to see what they are going to say. Because no one or Doctor can know your body better than you. Are Bodies give us signs if something is wrong.
-1	I most worry about how I am going to pay for the doctor bill AND the prescription they are likely to prescribe. It seems that everything requires a new medicine.
-1	the only think that makes me feel that way is physical check ups and also if i have to wait awhile to get into the doctor, i hate waiting in the room for an hour.
-1	If I need a physical for a job then the results have me anxious ready to work. I've never had a doctor make me worried about me maybe someone else's health as far as the elderly but not concerning my health
1	I feel most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor and she takes a very long time coming back into the room to give me test results.
1	shots make me anxious, as well as finding out something is seriously wrong. Or that I'll be on medicine for the rest of my life.
1	That they won't believe me. Or the that the next step in my treatment will be scheduled too far out and I have to wait a month to have a test done.
1	I am always afraid they will find something wrong with me.  I absolutely fear having something serious and needing surgery or some horrible disease like cancer.  It's terrifying for me to visit even if it's just for a cold.  
-1	I don't know if I will be there for an hour, waiting. If I have tests I would be anxious about the results. 
1	I am anxious about what the doctor may say is wrong and that it may be something serious and my mind wanders in all kinds of directions . 
1	everything kind of makes me nervous. I have a problem with depression and anxiety. I also have OCD which is another big problem  and causes much more stress.
1	When I visit the doctors office it is usually for a reason, and I am worried that it will be a larger health concern than I would like to have. For example, I worry that the bump on my ear must be removed by surgery and thinking about hearing that makes me anxious. 
1	It's most worrisome when you don't know what the results are going to be. It could be bad or it could be good, you don't really know what you're going to hear. Most of the times it ends up being good so worrying is probably unnecessary.
-1	I think I know how things will go, but there's always the possibility that I've missed something. I am never 100% confident in my ability to judge.
1	Life and all the problems that are surrounding me.  I have no power to make them stop cause I'm financially stuck at a place that I put myself in. I don't have family or trustworthy friends. Life is hard and I feel like there is no way out. 
1	i HATE going to the doctor and hospitals. i was in and out of them nonstop as a kid with very serious health problems.
-1	I always worry what they might find. I have a history of cancer and diabetes in my family and I am always concerned that is going to become a issue in my life as well. I guess that is what I am most worried about, something that I can not control happening and altering my life.
-1	this is a pointless exercise. I do not feel nervous or anxious in any way when I go to the doctor. 100 caracters is stupid.
-1	The idea that whatever is ailing me could be a terminal illness but those thoughts don't enter too often.
-1	Waiting and hoping everything goes well without finding any issues. Too much time thinking about the the visit in general.
-1	My family is prone to diabetes, high blood pressure and even a case of ovarian cancer.  I am not typically worried or anxious unless I have a pain or illness I cannot identify as a familiar feeling.
1	I have intense anxiety anyway just normally anyway. Doctors certainly make it worse. A lot of it is simply discomfort around the stranger. Another part is the vulnerability. 
-1	Mainly just the fear of a bad diagnosis. 
1	I have very strong white coat anxiety. I'm not worried about the aspect of pain particularly. It's more the whole aspect of fearing for the worst coupled with the unknown drives it. Loss of control and claustrophobic feelings also factor into it some extent. The apprehension is worse with some medical professionals than it is with others. 
1	In my experience people go to the doctor because something is wrong. As someone who has an anxiety disorder anyway, going to someone who can confirm that a problem is real and something could be terribly wrong just stresses me completely out. 
-1	Because when I go sometimes my blood pressure is up a little. And sometimes that ne nervous. And I worried about my sinus because I have them year. Around.
1	You never know what to expect the doctor to say. Especially if you aren't going on a regular basis then you will never know what to expect from the doctor. example waiting on blood work to process can be the most dreadful expereince as it leads to the patient waiting a day or two before results are complied. the anxious stage of mind comes into play when you are a student in school and waiting the teacher to tell you what grade you may have. This is the same factor that applies to the doctors room when you are always waiting on results.. 
-1	I am worried sometimes when I know something is wrong such as that I have gained too much weight or that I am uncertain about how some test results will go.
1	Sometimes not knowing what might happen. What if something is abnormal and It turns out to be something bad.
-1	waiting a long time (passed my appointed time) to see the dr knowing that a needle stick is involved (I hate needles)
1	what the outcome is going to be on what is wrong with me. will my prescription be expensive. how much out of pocket will this cost us.
-1	I rarely feel anxious or worried when i visit the doctor's office. The only time i might be anxious or worried is if i have received negative test results and am going in to discuss them. 
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried about going to see a doctor is that I'm very nervous to tell someone my problems because they might not understand or they might judge me. 
1	Because of the health issues that I have when I go to the doctor I feel anxious because I never know what to expect with my blood pressure & blood work even though I try to eat right & take care of myself I never know if it is working.
-1	nothing im calm at all times no matter what happens ill worry afterwards no sense in worrying before hand
-1	 I am always anxious or worried when I approach a doctor's office besides just a regular check-up usually if you go to the doctors because something is wrong with you so I always get nervous and always think the worst
-1	What makes me feel anxious or worried during a doctor's visit is usually just my condition, hoping that it isn't something super serious or expensive to fix. Needles also make me uncomfortable, but they are a necessary evil at times.  
1	I am always worried that a doctor is not going to hear what I am telling them or ignore my symptoms and play them down.  Then I get a huge bill a few weeks later.  I often felt like I was scammed or taken advantage of. This has happened so many times in the past.  
-1	I am very calm and in control of myself most of the time. I take my time and apply understanding of the matter before I make a final decision.
-1	You never know what to expect in an office. Sometimes just having to wait a long period of time for a dr. to show up makes you feel anxious. Too much time to think and worry.
1	Just worry that she might find something is wrong.  I just don't enjoy all the checking and feeling around on my body.
1	Thinking that they will find something that I am not looking forward and giving positive results when I am a negative. This just happened to me. 
-1	I am always worried that I will get bad news about my blood pressure or my weight.  It is a nerve wrecking experience.
1	The biggest anxiety or worry would have to be the worry of receiving bad news about my health.
1	The only thing that really gives me any problems is thinking about the unknown and the possiblity that there could be something wrong with me that i don't know about.  This presents a small level of anxiety and fear that there could be something that is not good. 
-1	I am not often anxious or worried when I go to the doctor's office, but sometimes I am. These times include whenever I am going to get a vaccination as I am afraid of needles and the possibility of something happening with my body after getting blood drawn. 
-1	I get anxious if I think something is seriously wrong. If I have a very concerning symptom, like a lump or blood....that usually makes me nervous. Otherwise, I am generally at ease while at the doctors office.
-1	I know I take good care of my health but with my families health history you just never know what results could be of a test you have. The waiting game is tough.
-1	Just having to know what really is going on with me can be a source of worry. It's always uncertain until the doctor gives you confirmation of what's really going on with you. Until I know, I am waiting and that makes me anxious. And obviously depending on what I end up learning about, that can make me even more anxious.
1	To think that something can go wrong or give me bad news makes me worried about visiting my doctor indeed
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried about visiting a doctor's office is that he might tell me that I have some serious disease
1	the fact that he isn't going to listen to my questions or concerns. waiting way pas tmy appointment time to be seen
-1	I don't have any anxiety when I go to the doctors office.  I usually only make appointments when necessary so I don't feel that anyone's time is wasted.  the only thing that really bugs me is when I have to wait a long time without any feedback from the front office staff.  I know that emergencies come up which throws the schedules off, but I believe that keeping patients informed is important.  If you don't let them know about a schedule change you are basically saying that their time isn't as valuable as someone else's.  so I guess this is my anxiety issue when going to the doctor. 
1	Well i am worried they might find out i have some reare diease or something like that and that could have a big impact on my life and well being
1	Im very private so when it comes to getting seen by a gynocologist im a little uneasy. Also you never know whats going on while your sleep so...
1	I fear I won't be taken seriously, or that I will again be carelessly diagnosed or prescribed another harmful medication.
1	not knowing what they will find, or even if they will listen to what is going on with me
-1	If I don't know what is wrong with me (as opposed to a physical or regular visit for chronic conditions) I get a little anxious.
-1	If blood work is being done, the results make me anxious because HBP and other ailments run in my family 
-1	I think the scariest thing is not knowing what the result of your test are going to be. Even if you feel super healthy and you are living a healthy lifestyle nobody can be 100% sure that they are healthy 
1	When I walk into my doctor's office I am worried about what he might tell me because I have to blood work all the time for high cholesterol, diabetes, ect and you do not know if you will get good results or good news, and you never know if he will find anything new or not 
-1	I think that all people who go to a medical practice feel the same as me. Perhaps the patient goes with a slight abdominal discomfort and in the consultation discovers that it was not something so light what he felt but it was or is a serious and delicate disease. However, I recommend taking this risk and going to the doctor. That will always be the best option.
-1	Usually I am most anxious or worried about receiving vaccinations. I do not prefer them and cross my fingers each time that I do not have to receive any at that visit. 
-1	You never know what he going to say to you if he is going to blow you off or try to really take his time and help with yoir issue
-1	What makes me most anxious when seeing a doctor is figuring out what the problem might be with me or my body
-1	
-1	I do not feel anxious when I visit the doctor. I am confident I will get good care and my questions will be answered too.
1	The thing that i might not feel comfortable with the different tests that they do. Especially i don't like poking my hands for blood tests and i don't like the fact of them asking too many questions which might not be necessary.
-1	I feel like i have something that is wrong with me. even though most of the time I know that I am not in a bad condition or i know that there is nothing wrong I feel like there is something wild and crazy that is gonna pop up with no cure
-1	Well you never know what will happen. You can feel fine but tests show that you are not. Who knows.
-1	That the doctor I'm seeing may or may not be fully educated on my specific needs. That I may be lumped into a group instead of evaluated on an individual basis.
-1	Wondering how long that I would have to sit in the waiting room.Also slightly worry if any negative changes in my blood work.
-1	I;m always worried they are going to find something wrong with me, which is very stupid but something I can not shake.
-1	Nothing, really. I have an aortic aneurysm which gets monitored each year. Some concern there by my cardiologist.
1	Ever since my mother died of a rare neurological disease, I worry that something terrible is going to happen to me, especially in regard to my health.  It is a ridiculous fear, and one that I am trying to get over.  I worry about what could happen 
-1	When I do not know what is wrong with me.
1	I'm worried but also curious, if they will find something and worried they may make a wrong choice for me.
-1	nothing makes me feel most anxious and worried when visiting the doctor's office... 
-1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is my skin appearing to be in need of hydration. I never want to appear to my doctor as being as ashy.
-1	I feel totally relaxed and if I have questions I ask him.He is very direct and fortunately I have no serious issues other than age.
-1	Not knowing how unpleasant the treatment/examination might be. Also I might receive bad news. That bad news might raise the possibility of pain, suffering and unpleasant treatments.
-1	When I don't know the unknown or just the entire process of waiting for test results to come back can be a little anxious. But overall that feeling doesn't last long.
-1	There is really nothing that makes me feel anxious or worried. The only thing i do not like is waiting. I am not overly cmnfrotable around sick strangers. I get a little uptight when everyone is coughing and sneezing and the room seems to get smaller. Again I have no worries at the DR other than waiting.
-1	Probably just wondering how much it's going to cost. Everyone knows that doctors don't traditionally communicate prices before anything is said and done. Plus you pay a copay as soon as you walk in so you're kind of locked into being there anyway. I also start to worry that whatever I'm visiting for doesn't become a senseless come back again tomorrow or in 3 days so I can charge you for some more arbitrary services. Healthcare cost is so inflated and so many people are in the dark because it benefits the guys mailing out the huge bills.
1	When I visit a doctor I feel the most anxious at the waiting. Waiting for the doctor to arrive and waiting to receive information about my condition. I wish the process was much quicker so I wouldn't have time to worry something awful might happen.
-1	I hope that it goes well, but a 65, things can happen and happen quickly. I'm on blood pressure meds and have been treated in hospitol for liver issues associated with that. I'm always concerned that something may crop up.
-1	I have had terrible experience with medical. So I am very careful about Doctors.I have had a botched up surgery when I was young, so I always feel anxious visiting any doctors office.
1	That it will be more serious than I thought and my life could drastically change for the worst. I also worry that there can be a treatment for my problem but my insurance wouldn't cover it. I hate insurances, I think they are evil, and you can not consider a doctor appt without considering consequences from insurances. 
1	I always feel anxious. I never know what is going to show up on the tests. I have several things wrong with me. What's gonna show up this time
1	Their standard assessment equipment sometimes causes errors in obtaining vital signs.  The doctor often will not re-check the vitals and my anxiety usually causes my blood pressure to read higher than it is. I get anxious when they try to give me new medication for something that hasn't been examined and followed through properly.
-1	If I am sick, I will get anxious before seeing doctor worrying about what may be the cause of illness.
-1	Getting bad news like cancer
1	What I fear most is being criticized for how I am living day to day, in particular as to how it affects my weight.  Sometimes I gain too may pounds, and that worries me.  I do not enjoy weight loss programs. 
-1	It's uncomfortable to go to the doctor period. I get anxious from the time I call to set an appointment, to the time I leave. Fortunately, I don't go to the doctor enough to not be anxious. I don't think it's because I fear they will find something wrong, but just that it is an uncomfortable situation.
-1	I think the worst part of it is just the waiting and the anxiety that provides to you, not knowing what might happen or what is wrong with you
-1	i do not feel particularly anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. if i had to choose something, then i would say that waiting for test results may sometimes make me feel a little bit anxious.
-1	I dont know the dr I am going to see, Will he answer my questions? Or be one that zips into the room, looks at there watch and has to leave
1	My main worry is that the doctor will not be there.  In the past 12 months I have been to my appointment each month only to have the doctor on vacation 2 of those times and one time no one was there and the door was locked.  I don't worry about what he may tell me I only worry that I wont be able to get my Rx's filled.
1	Having to pay the cost of going to the doctor. Another thing would be like knowing that the doctor will say that something is wrong.
-1	i dont feel any type of way as long as that pregnacy test is negative then im am good. i like to get my medicine for free and a low copay
-1	Potential health issues.
-1	I feel most anxious when there is an awkward kind of conversation, I'd rather just sit and listen to music or something and relax than have to converse.
-1	I have hypertension, so I am most often worried that I have not done enough to control it and my BP may be high when I am there.
-1	Finding something wrong
1	I feel worried sad or anxious visiting the doctor's office because of last year's summer and my mom's experience. 
-1	usually when I have to go to the doctors office, it is because of an injury or an illness. This most of the time means that I am in some sort of pain or something is uncomfortable with my body. being that this is the case the majority of the time can cause the stress level to increase more than normal. by no means is it the doctors fault. It is simply the fact of the pain or uneasiness caused in my body, that cause me be stressed in wondering what is wrong with myself, or if and when the pain or illness will end.
1	I worry about hearing something is wrong. I panick whenever i don't feel well. There is too much negativity around me that makes me anxious.
1	Being sicker than I can handle.
1	What makes me feel the most concerned about visiting a doctor's office is that they likely don't know what to do, but will gladly try a few things that will end up costing way too much. A person is lucky if they don't end up feeling worse, being told there's nothing wrong, and/or walking away having to take a bunch of expensive pills. No, thank you.
1	Everything. The way I was brought up is that if you go to the doctor something is SERIOUSLY wrong with you. 
-1	Finding out that whatever ailment I have is worse than I thought it was. I would be terrified to find out I have something like Cancer or some serious disease.
-1	The only thing I get worried about is that I am going to forget to tell the Dr. something or not be able to communicate correctly.
-1	Probably the bill.
1	I just am anxious that something bad will pop up. I think things go ignored and could later turn out to be bigger issues the longer they go unlooked at. 
1	I get anxious and worried alot about exams and blood workm i do not like needles or shots. I am afraid of getting bad news
-1	
1	Generally I don't go to the doctor unless I know something is wrong, so it's the wondering what the problem is 
-1	At every doctor's visit I possess the irrational fear that there is either something wrong with my baby or something wrong with me.I don't think that innate fear will ever go away.
1	you never know what's going on, what they will say, or where it will all go. There is no reason to know everything, even with a doctor. 
1	I just hate being examined and having to visit the doctor in general. Life would be easier without having yearly exams to have to go to. :)
-1	The one thing that causes me to be anxious or worried is that I sometimes put off going to the doctor over aches and pains and I am afraid he will find something majorly wrong with me. 
1	to hear some bad news about my health
-1	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting my doctor's office. I understand any questions and the answers involved in my care.
1	What worries me most when going to the doctor's office is not knowing what it is that they will be doing and what they will find.  I also find it somewhat unsettling to have a stranger looking me over and touching me. 
1	I worry about how I'm going to pay for the services. My insurance has a high deductible, and I am always concerned about cost. 
1	it makes me feel like I am going to be leaving the place poorer every time I visit an office. Its a never ending situation and it never gets better
1	"I get nervous/worried about ""bad"" news that I could be receiving from test or exam results. Even if it's a follow up or a re-rest, I still feel nervous that some of the news won't be positive. "
-1	I do not have that problem. I dont have that problem. I amnot worried or anxious at all.i do not worry 
1	I worry about what could be wrong with me.  It's not the doctor that makes me nervous. It's dealing with sickness.
-1	
-1	To know what the doctor will tell me, if it is a bad thing, if it is a treatment, if it is an operation, a rehabilitation, or if it is not bad
1	I am usually worried the doctor might found something terribly wrong with me. Also he won't offer me a solution 
1	I feel that the doctor is judging me and my lifestyle and will be harsh and critical of my choices.
-1	Most my symptoms are things that I worry about, and not the doctor herself. I am fearful that some of the pains I am having are serious medical conditions.
-1	Mostly I am worried about unseen or unknown health issues that might show up in an examition. If I am unsure what caused the problem that brought me to the doctor's office, I will usually have some sort of concern or worry. If I have a general understanding or notion as to what is wrong with me such as a flu, I am typically not too worried at all. 
1	That they are going to find something else wrong with me, as if there aren't enough already, and it is going to require more tests and my insurance won't pay for it. 
1	There were times when I had not been to a Dr for a few years. When I did decide to go for a check up and breast exam, I was afraid because it had been so long since I had been to a Dr.
1	Sometimes according to the pain level I don't know what to expect, Cancer is so widespread nowadays you never know.
-1	that he may find something new  as i have several items i am dealing with.                              
1	I am always! always! Worried as to what the dr. may find, at my age its not a matter of if but when. I have been a care giver for my husband through cancer, heart problems and glaucoma. I wonder who is going to be my care giver? My husband is more than happy to let me handle all aspects of his health care, he just has to show up. I just dont have the courage to do it for myself.
1	I think it's just the idea that, while I may be there for one thing, they may find something else wrong with me. The idea that all the care I take to be healthy and to make sure I am well might mean nothing because my body might betray me in a way I have little control over. 
1	I don't like exams where the doctor has to touch you many times or speaking in front of the nurse, also I don't like pee in a cup for urinalysis 
-1	I have HIV so I am always worried that my medications may stop working or if I am starting a new treatment that it may not be as useful as my prior regime.
1	I am a very paranoid person when it comes to my health. Health is one of the most important things in this world so I am always concerned about losing my health. Even though I live a relatively healthy lifestyle and am young I still worry more than I should. 
-1	Aside from the tedious visits which is a constant reminder that I am a cancer patient, I have no qualms other than that I do not work and my income is low which makes daily living sometimes unbearable.  I was a vibrant 62 year old with my own home a gorgeous leased vehicle and then in an instant I was a cancer patient.  It was not how I envisioned my life to be and was hopeful that I would work until full retirement age of 66 or later.  Visiting the cancer center is not a big deal.
1	I am anxious because I don't want to be diagnosed with serious disease that don't have cure. I don't want the doctor to find out if there is another disease in me and that make anxious 
1	I don't like the feeling of not knowing what they are going to do to me. I hate blood and I hate needles. I like to know what to expect when I go places.
-1	I have a family history of diabetes and heart disease. As much as I take care of myself, I am worried that I would get a diagnosis that is not in my favor.
1	I have felt anxious at a DR's appointment when they found something wrong with my health. This usually leads to fear and overthinking a condition or trying to guess the treatment plan.
1	Just going to doctor of any kind makes me worried and anxious because I  dread going to any doctor. Just thinking about going causes those feelings
1	I don't like the feeling of being exposed to strangers. I don't want to find out information that might make me change something drastic in my life.
1	Obviously it depends on the reason for the visit. I suppose a strange growth might be the most worrisome with a history of cancer in my family.
-1	I've never felt anxious or worried at the doctors office I completely trust my doctor he's never failed me yet
-1	I know I am going to feel foolish saying this but I absolutely hate getting shots. It's not the pain that it causes but rather the mental build-up of thinking of the needle going in you and all the blood.
1	If I am sick or my child is sick, there are so many things that could be wrong. I want my doctor to listen what I have to tell them.
-1	Having good health for many years and then all of a sudden, you are having problems that will not go away.  You have tried to wait it out, however, it cannot wait.  Sometimes the doctor is late due to an emergency.
1	Just being in a doctor's office makes me anxious. You know you are there because you're not feeling well, but you don't know the exact reason why and you never know what you might be diagnosed with. You also never know if the doctor is going to reprimand you about the way that you handle your health and that can be embarrassing and upsetting. I am a relatively private person and I hate putting myself so out there and that includes telling the doctor private health information.
1	I just don't like al the poking and prodding, and the overly eager attitude to just prescribe medication for every little thing.
1	The fear that I've not taken care of myself well enough and it will result in a malady that I could have avoided.  The prospect of not being well for my children.
1	The outcome of what ails me. Is it worse than I thought it would be?
1	"Again, I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life. I always worry that my current doctor will get overwhelmed and ""give up"" trying to find solutions to help my quality of life increase. I am very anxious that she will not be able to work with my specialists who treat my many conditions."
1	I am worried because I am overweight and I feel she wants to discuss it but she doesn't I feel anxious when i get weighed.
-1	Doctors can be very pleasant to be around but many can also be untrustworthy.  It has been that way for all time and it wouldn't just suddenly halt one day.  Doctors can make sure that they are giving you a prescription that may not be the best for you as long as it is the best for them. 
-1	I always dislike going for my physical because of the thorough examination given,  and then having to have blood drawn.
1	Sometimes I worry I'm going to hear bad news about my health. The environment also makes me anxious (lighting, lots of sick people, general busyness)
1	Because you never know what information you will get from the doctors. The uncertainty can often keep me from going and makes me scared.
1	When I visit the doctor, I'm afraid that I am going to be very sick. This feeling comes even if I've had no symptoms or other serious illness
1	The thought of having your blood drawn makes me cringe.
1	You never know what the doctor is doing to exactly say so that sometimes can make me nervous, because it could be good or bad 
1	It's not just going to the doctors that I get worried it's an every day general feeling that I have along with my anxiety
-1	I do not feel worried when I go to the doctor.  I believe in a simple and necessary procedure that does not require any additional alarm.
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried, just cautious on whether a doctor is telling me the truth or trying to pad their pockets
-1	I feel anxious about a potential upsetting diagnosis at times especially when a concern could be a symptom of a serious ailment like cancer
1	I am worried that I will not ask everything I need to ask or will miss something she is trying to tell me.  I do not like to be touched.
1	Sometimes I have fear before entering the doctor's office in terms of finding a health complication that I didn't know I had before.  Usually, these examinations end well for me. 
-1	Always makes me nervous to see a doctor, although my health is quite good.  Probably left over from child hood when I would have to go because of something stupid I did.
-1	Sometimes I have to do lab work and they have to draw blood. I am not a fan of needles. They make me nervous. Also the results of lab work because there is so much that can change especially if you're genetically predisposed to certain things. 
-1	
1	I usually feel very calm when I'm at the doctor's however, I am for the most part in good health. I guess the only anxiety I have would be them telling me I have a terminal illness or something horribly wrong. 
-1	I'm not used to people poking me and prodding me. I also realize that I'm often being judged by my outside (since I don't wear makeup, will they assume I'm depressed?), that my outside figure doesn't reflect my habits (yes, I weight 175 lbs. And, yes, I go running multiple times a week. Both are true), and that some of my statements will be considered lies (people believe me when I say I don't smoke, they mostly believe me when they say I don't drink, but I'm pretty sure no one believes me when I tell them I'm a virgin). 
-1	With me getting up in age I get more worried then I did when I was younger. Any kind of symptoms that I'm having now I sometimes think the worst and that I'm seriously ill.  
-1	Most of the time when I visit the doctor for anything other than routine physicals, I don't always feel I know how my treatment will go. It seems sometimes I have left the doctor's office being no closer to healed than I was when I entered.
-1	Because of the uncertainly of what's really going on is what I get anxious or worried about when I go see my doctor.
-1	Pap smears are just uncomfortable even though my Dr does his best to make it less streesful it more  the idea of the process that makes me anxious 
1	I feel that something is wrong, especially with aging, that won't be able to be reversed or treated.
1	getting lost in the shuffel, not enough time, wrong diagonsithesis, cleaniness of the place, wait times, etc,.....
1	I mostly worry about the germs I'm getting sitting in the waiting room. I also do not enjoy the shots that come along with physicals. They tend to give me anxiety but I do not necessarily have a problem with the doctor, nurse, or the wait time when I do have an appointment. 
-1	I do not like waiting in the waiting room.  I feel like the doctor will always try to give me medication i don't need.
1	I am worried that my doctor will tell me I have a disease or that I am overweight. Or he'll tell me that I need to start eating better.
1	 it can  be stressful when they dont care  and they are amazing and nice and love it   they are special and caring
-1	How long I have to wait before being seen, Doctor is always running late. Also how easy it is to contact office.
1	What makes me feel very anxious is probably the fact that I wont know the results until a couple weeks after the appointment. Therefore I tend to worry a lot about the results and the outcome while visiting the doctor office.
-1	I worry that something out of the ordinary will be discovered, and that I'll have some problem that I don't even know about.
1	that something will be wrong and it is unexpected.
-1	NOthing.  I really dont require a lot of personal space or require any privacy as far as my body is concerned so I really don't care what she needs to do.  I'm also super healthy so I'm never ther for anything too crazy
1	What makes me anxious is the possibility of having a serious condition. I know it's just a small chance of it, but just the possibility of that make me very nervous and scared. 
-1	I am usually worried that my blood pressure will be high. The anxiety ends up making my blood pressure high. It is sort of a cycle. 
-1	Potential of the doctor finding health problems.
1	Worried that they will find something wrong that would require expensive treatments or hinder my standard of living that would put a burden on my family and friends
1	What makes me anxious or worried half of the time is what to expect or hear from the doctor it could be a good or bad thing i never know

1	I am a breast cancer survivor so I am always anxious before any doctor appointment now. I feel like I would rather not go and not risk getting anymore surprise bad news. This usually occurs with blood testing or any other types of medical tests. I felt fine before I was diagnosed so I know that there is a chance to feel good and not know something is wrong inside. It will probably make me feel this way for the rest of my life.
-1	I worry maybe my blood work might come back with something wrong. Otherxious.than that I usually am not anxious.
1	Libel I don't want to hear I have cancer of that I have like 5 more days to live like thaws crazy and scary like no body wants to hear thaya bro like thaws scary like make sure you look for the early sign out right away and speak to your doctor

1	The only time I get anxious as the doctor is when I am getting a shot or having some kind of test done.
1	The uncertainty of what's causing my problem makes me anxious or worried.  I have to be really sick and can not find any resolution on my own to go to a doctor.  I will have exhausted all possible natural solutions first before I consult a doctor.  I am anxious of what they will say is wrong and if they will judge me for my actions or inaction.  I worry that something is seriously wrong.  
-1	The uncertainty of not knowing whatâs making me feel ill, of having something very hurtful or that may result in a painful procedure or that might cost a lot of money.
1	I worry because I have bad habits. I know he' going to tell me things I don't want to hear.
1	I always feel worried and anxious when visiting a doctors office because I have a fear of doctors hurting me since I was little, I have never been comfortable because when I was little my doctor would have to check my private parts and I didn't like being touched there by someone I only saw once in a while and didn't have a trusted relationship with and he would often call me fat so it made me even more uncomfortable which carried on to my adult life even though I switched doctors, my experience with my first doctor still stuck with me. I have also had doctors spring stuff on me like I was going in for a flu shot and my doctor would suddenly say I was getting a Pap smear done too. I need time to mentally prepare myself when I go to the doctors. 
-1	I only get anxious when I have to undergo regular female tests like mammograms and pap smears.  There is always the nagging concern of whether something negative being found.

1	I'm a single mom. I have two teenagers who rely on me and my financial and emotional support. I am the one constant in their lives. The one person they couldn't live without.  This is mainly the reason for my anxiousness when I visit the Dr's. I want to be there for my children as long as I possibly can.
1	just the waiting to see what he or she says
1	I'm always worried when I go to the doctor because of the history of cancer in my family.  I get worried that little things may be precursor's to cancer or something worse.
1	I'm afraid that they will try to force me to get a procedure that I don't want. 
-1	Just the usual that most females would say.  Going for an annual physical can be anxiety provoking, but ends up just fine.
-1	It feels kind of impersonal and condescending to be sitting there feeling as though you are being talked down to most of the time, or like you have 15 minutes of this doctor's time and then he's moving on. Being on display makes me feel anxious.
-1	The feeling of finding out if I am sick. or just generally in a bad conditioning. Bad conditioning of the body will affect life greatly.
1	Not a great place Sick people there and it's not a trusting environment Can Be bad results Medication pushed 
-1	"I feel the most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office when I""m afraid that I won't be believed, they simply won't care about my problem or that my individual concerns or needs will be ignored simply so they can see more patients that day. I'm afraid, anxious and desperate when they ignore me and my symptoms. So, if my original concern isn't addressed then I usually leave feeling physically as well as emotionally unwell after that. Subhuman almost that I don't matter enough to listen to. Then I question why I spent money to be ignored and still have the same symptoms that I walked in with."
-1	Most of the time I am fine. Occasionally, an illogical thought will pop into my head and make me worry that my symptoms could be some rare disease. 
1	My weight, it has always been an issue so I know when I got to the doctors office that there will always be a conversation concerning my weight and to try and get me on the right path to live a healthier lifestyle
1	Well it's always a scary situation as you get older when you go to the doctor because even if it's something minor they may find something major and the thought is always scary. 
-1	Nothing really. I'm always calm about going to the doctor, even if I do feel sick or injured. I guess I just think positive the entire time. I don't know. It never bothered me or worried to go and see a doctor.
1	They don't know what they're doing   Most of the time, they're just guessing.  Often, I know more than them.
1	I am most concerned about what may be found about my medical condition.  There may be something new that appears about my condition.
1	I have family a history of certain negative health problems so I am always concerned about test results that relate to any or all of these conditions.
-1	I'm afraid that there may be something wrong, so I'm worried they find a health condition. Especially if there's something going on in my head, I usually think the worse like a tumor or something drastic. 
1	I'm afraid of hearing bad news or having my negative suspicions confirmed. Who knows what you can be diagnosed with during a doctor's appointment 
-1	Finding out something is terribly wrong with me would be very bad news. I'm very relieved every time this is not the case. It's best to check things early and practice preventative care instead of be late to treat something after it develops.
-1	afraid they are going to find something else wrong with me. i already have several medical conditions that require medication. i dont want to have another one
-1	nothing the only time this would be true is if I had some very different and strange test done and was going to get my results
-1	Not knowing how something is going to turn out. Whether a test is going to give not so great results or something else like that.
1	Will I need any bloodwork done? Will I have to fight them to convince them to change my birth control or acknowledge my bi-annual sinus infections that I've gotten like clockwork since I was 16? 
-1	I think that having to wait is worrying. It is just not knowing what is going to happen next that makes me anxious.
-1	I am usually pretty good when going to the doctor.   I do get anxious waiting for them to come into the room but that is more due to me hating sitting there cold in the gown waiting and nothing to do with the actual appointment
-1	I feel anxious and worried about my blood pressure results. I also worry that I would have to take lots of tests which costs a lot.
-1	I am most worried that my doctor will find a new problem or disease when I am examined. I don't want a new disease to deal with. I am also worried that I will lose my health insurance and I won't be able to afford treatment.
1	That I'm going to walk out of the office with nothing accomplished, no answers and no solutions.  I sometimes feel like even though they listen, they are reluctant to prescribe anything that would give me relief.
-1	Just the general routine of having the physical and examition because it's such a persol matter.
-1	i guess the thing that tends to make me the most anxious when it comes to doctors and doctor's offices overall is the whole unknown aspects of things. not knowing what to expect tends to make me uneasy
1	all of my tests may came out bad even though i weigh so little and i don't want to take any medications, i only like taking vitamins and i would want a doctor to tell me exactly what vitamins i need to take so my tests would be perfect
-1	nothing does I know that as a black man are should I say a real JEW everything is against me hahahahahaha
1	I don't want to be touched really. After that, I don't want to hear anything bad.
-1	No worries at all. Have to remind the doctor what to test for a blood test. He is in such a rush and incompent
1	I don't want to figure out I have cancer or some other type of illness.  I also feel anxious cause I have to get home to my kids and the doctor's wait times can be long.
-1	Generally speaking, I am fine going to the doctor's office unless I am waiting on test results for something or expected to have blood drawn, which I hate. I was the most anxious/worried when I was pregnant, as I had a number of manageable issues arise. Each time I went for another appointment, I feared the news of something else.
1	I don't like to give details about private issues. The healthcare system seems to be set up as a referral business. The first visit is just to get a patient to go somewhere else.
-1	I often feel anxious that the doctor won't take me seriously or that they will want to prescribe me medication that I won't feel comfortable taking. 
-1	Nothing makes me feel worried or anxious about going to my doctor or doctors, I have nothing to add about this question I love my doctors and don't fear going to get an exam
-1	At my age of 78 there can be anything go wrong. My body changes like the weather. My doctor keeps changing my medications as the situation warrents.
1	My family has a lot of health problems. While I have been relatively healthy for my whole life so far, things could change at any time. I get nervous that I won't have my health in a future situation, so I try to do everything I can to stay healthy so I can live an active life. 
-1	I just always feel a little bit concerned that the doctor might find something bad (cancer, a need for surgery, a health condition.)
1	just coming to see a doctor. its been that way since i was achild.i love y doctors work.look to work with my doctor for manny years to come.
1	Getting your results back from a test like blood work or urine test. That us what can make me feel anxious or uneasy.
1	When the doctor's abrupt and seems distracted, I start to worry. When (S)he's not very communificate, asks few questions and needs to be prodded, that's worse. 
-1	I am very confident about seeing a doctor or any medical prectitioner to diagnose anything that is not right with my health. I am all about being healthy and will do what is needed to remain so.
-1	I worry about unexpected health conditions that are a risk to my overall health and having to take more test to confirm the condition.
-1	As a healthy person i usually visit once a year for basic blood work
1	fear of not knowing if im going to get some bad news pertaining to my health whether it could be in the form of terminal cancer or any other diagnosis
-1	I am not usually anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office.  I don't usually have a reason to be.  I know what to expect with my doctors.  They are straight forward and honest with me.  They will go over all of my options with me and discuss pros and cons of all of those options to help me to make an informed decision so there usually isn't a reason to be worried.
-1	I am not sure, but I must be anxious because my blood pressure is always inflated at the doctor's office. Maybe it is the drive into the city, which I do not do very often. I don't think I am anxious over the visit or exam really, unless I am worried that I have a condition that is worrisome... Like thinking I have cancer or something like that.
-1	taking blood test and hearing bad news makes me feel anxious and worried. sometimes i don't want to go to the doctors office because i just don't want to be there.
1	I get anxious when visited the doctor because I'm afraid of what they might find and that it will be bad news.
-1	I don't tend to feel anxious when visiting my doctor.  I feel like there's generally something to be done if needed.
1	What medication is the doctor going to put me on? I don't like needles and I have a good idea of what is wrong with me before I go to the doctor.
1	Being told I'm not healthy.
1	Will the doctor order a lot of useless test and try to talk me into useing dangerous or worthless drugs.I have even told the doctor what was wrong and the needed treatment.They refused to do what I explained and went testing for other problems.The test were a waist and they came and agreed with my proper assesment. I got the medication I needed  and they Did not charge a office or doctors fee. 
1	He always tries to prescribe pills to me I don't want to take. An example is my blood pressure is normal, and yet he stills tries for me to get high blood pressure pills.
-1	Not right now. I look forward to makeing sure I am staying healthy now. 
1	there's always something in the back of your mind telling you it's worse than it is. Fortutely, it usually isn't.
1	I have a lot of health problems I feel don't seem to get resolved and my questions never get answered to my satisfaction. Always feel rushed
-1	Just waiting for them to come see you or bring back any news or results about your condition, plus getting examined and all the steps you have to go through.
1	If he's going to find something wrong with me
1	The potential for being disagnosed with something new and dangerous can make me feel worried.  The potential for being pressured into new medicines and/or shots can make me feel worried.  Being told to take 2 different blood medications when I have not yet started taking the first one makes me feel worried and manipulated.
1	I'm not anxious about visiting the doctor unless a procedure needs to be done. I don't like leaving with the same questions I had going in with the same amount of uncertainty as before. It feels like a waste of time.
-1	The only thing that makes me anxious about visiting the doctors office is that something may be wrong with me. 
-1	A possible negative blood test or being told I need an invasive procedure. I never feel Extremely anxious 
-1	I am not sure what it is. I guess I am introverted so sitting in a quiet room with someone I donât know well is uncomfortable. Also I donât want them to think I am seeking drugs 
-1	If they say you need to see specialist after going in for a routine exam to get your meds refilled. Even though they may say this is nothing, but I will feel better if someone else has a look to confirm.
-1	I feel most anxious about getting test results and the impending decision that will need to be made based on those results. It makes me anxious about overthinking the decision or making the wrong choice.
1	I don't like needles, shots and having blood drawn are very painful for me. I get anxious when I think about shots or having blood drawn. They always leave bruises on me. It is hard for them to find my veins.
-1	The only thing I can think of that makes me anxious or nervous is getting blood work results back after a test. 
1	Even though it hasn't been diagnosed, I'm certain that I've got some form of an anxiety disorder, so I'm pretty much always on edge when visiting the doctor's office. I'm a pretty modest person (and being asexual probably doesn't help this), so anything that involves getting a little too touchy-feely makes me extremely uncomfortable. For instance, I know that I should really visit a gynecologist or the like, but the thought of it freaks me out too much. I actually took far longer than I should have to go to the doctor about my IBS before I knew what it was, because I was afraid that I'd have to have a colonoscopy or something similar (as mentioned earlier, I was fortunate that my doctor also suffers from it, so as soon as I started talking about my symptoms, she knew exactly what it was).
-1	If I have a feeling that I have an unwanted medical condition, I worry the entire time I am there until my doctor confirms or denies that there is a problem.  
-1	
-1	What makes me anxious especially when I am going in for something that I think is wrong. If it is just a standard check up then I think everything is fine and do not worry.
1	The doctor might be concerned about what symptoms I've been having. I never know when my health might change. 
1	I am always nervous around doctors because If I am at the doctor it is because something is wrong with my health that I have not been able to address by myself. That being said, I also am just nervous around unfamiliar people in general, and as a young and fairly healthy person, all doctors are unfamiliar. 
1	No one ever wants to hear bad news about their health and when you don't see a physician often, it's likely that there may be underlying issues you are not aware of.
1	They probably aren't qualified to do what they do. They are LARPing.
1	I feel anxious overall. I would be anxious over the wait time in the lobby and not knowing what to expect at the appointment.
-1	"The thing that makes me most anxious is when I do not believe my concerns are being addressed. For instance, a doctor did not want to discuss my ankle problem during a ""well woman examination,"" and gave me a lecture about this. She said I'd need another appointment. I wanted to ask one or two quesions before I agreed to do that and she cut me off. The ankle pain was having a significant effect on my quality of life."
1	What you doing today I be home by now for you all doing good how you get old I tell my how you doing fine you doing fine I hope you get back to you
1	The fear of the unknown is one of my biggest issues regarding medical exams. To a certain degree I'd rather have a disease or ailment and not know about it and have peace of mind, rather than knowingly have a disease and stress over it.
-1	
-1	the only thing that would make me worry is if they found something seriously ill with me, other then that i have no issues going
1	The anticipation of the exam results is the most nerve wracking. There may be something that I wasn't aware about such as cancer. 
1	hearing bad news such as my health worsening or something more is happening and there will be bad news and it will be too late to reverse the issue
-1	Because due to my current ailments sometimes it's difficult to diagnose me properly. Also due to certain ailments unable to take the necessary medicine without adversely affecting other conditions.
-1	I worry that something minor will turn out to be something major. I'm not a hypochondriac, and I don't worry about stuff all the time. It's just that health can be complicated sometimes.
-1	I get worried I won't have the time to ask everything I need,  or that I put it off too long. 
1	Ibdont like going to the doctor, usually when I go i already know what's wrong or they give me some bogus answer and I research on my own. Maybe I should become a doctor.
1	i worry about bills and how i'm going to pay everything...i barely get by from month to month.....living on a certain amount a month is hard it does not cover everything
1	If I am not sure of what is causing the problem, my anxiety will be higher than if I understand the issues.
1	The cost of medical care is expensive and I don't want to spend a lot of money. My income is limited.
1	When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer the first doctor I went to see was so cold hearted I went to have a 2nd opinion.
1	I am sometimes worried that the test he does might not turn out well or that he might find something I will have to worry about
1	I am usually a little worried that they will find something wrong. Especially since so many of my recent visits have been prenatal - I always worry about the health of the baby. 
-1	I am just a worrier in general its my personality. At the doctor's office all that worries me is getting sick from touching something as I feel there are a lot of germs in these places.
-1	Not knowing what is going on with my body and how much the procedures will cost out of pocket just dont like to have a long when i go there
-1	I believe that the possibility of something going wrong or finding out bad news or getting a shot is what makes me anxious or worried.
-1	nothing, I like going to the drs to find out what my aches and pains are.  I feel much better knowing they have a name or a reason.
1	Unless I am having a routine visit then there is always a chance that I could have a serious problem. Even when having a routine visit there is that chance, but it is more worrisome when the problem is not something you have normally dealt with. In my case I have a condition that will generally get worse as I age and I am anxious because I may get information that I have gotten worse instead of staying the same. 
-1	I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office. The only scenario I can imagine this might happen to someone is they go to a new doctor and don't know what to expect or happen.
-1	The unknown is the biggest source of worry or anxiety that I have whenever I have to visit the doctor's office.
-1	I haven't had any bad experiences visiting doctors office, so far. However my family and I  have bad several bad experiences at the hospital with Interns. Not saying all Interns, just the ones that I have encountered. You can feel they Are only here for the required amount of time. Rush through. No bed side manner. They know they probably won't see you again. 
1	I am always anxious or nervous that something is wrong with me, or that they will find something that is abnormal.  I also just get uneasy in hospitals/doctor's offices in general.
1	I worry the most about my health being worse than the previous time that I saw him. I get anxious that he can tell that I have not been following his guidelines perfectly in regards to taking care of my personal health.
-1	I never feel anxious or worried when i visit a doctors office even if i have a serious problem so this doesnt really apply to me.
-1	It all depends what I am seeing the doctor for. Routine checkups I do not worry about. When I have a problem I may start to wonder what may be wrong.
1	I fell so much anxious its not true but a little bit. My family matter regarding the child makes me a little bit anxious. 
-1	he fact is when it comes to visiting the doctor, anxiety-induced ... But there are staff members in every doctor's office trained to help patients feel more comfortable - staff ... a well-placed joke or humorous comment, lets patients know you're ... Doctors' offices are working on other ways to make visits more ...
1	A few things. I get anxious because I'm not sure I'll be able to express all of my concerns, because I'm worried they won't take my concerns seriously or will dismiss them, and because I might leave without any answers (because they don't know what is wrong). I also get anxious when talking to people anyway, and doctors are worse than most people. They are busy and I worry about taking up their time. My symptoms are weird. I'm afraid I'll just look crazy.
-1	I really don't feel anxious. I go seeking relief, not fear.I think my biggest concern could be the possibility of a long wait which doesn't happen often now. Being Type 1 diabetic I am more concerned with A1C and creatnine levels but I don't really worry.
-1	If I'm going in for something unknown, I might feel a bit anxious.  Other than that, it's routine body maintence.
-1	The only thing that makes me nervous is when they take blood because I hate needles.  I also have in the back of my mind the notion that the blood might come back with something negative that might negatively affect my life.
1	I am worried that I might find out that I have a serious and expensive disease like cancer.  If I had cancer it would complete change how I live my life.
-1	I don't she is a very good doctor and knows what she is doing I have great faith in my doctor she is very good
-1	SOMETIMES WHEN I VISIT MY DOCTOR I KEEP THINKING THAT HE WILL DISCOVER SOMETHING BAD WITH MY TEST RESULTS,BUT HE ALWAYS REASSURES ME NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE HE IS ON TOP OF MY HEALTHCARE.
1	If ever I am at a doctor's office, it is normally because I am experienced an unexplained medical issue. I am always worried about what could be wrong. I am a worst case scenario type of person. I always assume the worst and come prepared to hear the worst, whether that is true or not. I also get worried that I will leave the office without many answers as to what is going on. I typically have great blood pressure, but as soon as they take it at the doctors office, it is always much higher due to my nerves!
-1	The thing that makes the feel the most anxious about visiting the doctor's office is finding more problems with my health 
-1	I do not feel anxious at all visiting the doctor's office.  I feel perfectly comfortable.  I have nothing else to add.
1	I don't have health insurance, so the most troubling issue that I have is paying my health care bills. The second issue is that my doctor is young and seems very quite, she isn't very vocal with comforting me in my medical issues.
-1	i don't unless there is something wrong and she need to tell me about or when i got to do a ekg and other test that i don't alway do
1	I worry that there might be some bad result or that I might be sick and not know it.  I get scared that the test being performed might not have the result I want.  I get nervous days before doctor appointments.  And if I have a procedure done I worry even more because I have to wait for the results.  The waiting is the thing that really makes me worry, if I know I am going to have to wait for some results I lose sleep the week before I have to go in.  Losing sleep makes me even more anxious and by the time I get to the appointment I am really uneasy.  Not knowing the outcome really makes me scared.
1	I just simply don't like visiting doctor's offices. I can't say that I enjoy doing this ever. Not many people do though.
1	I always fear I'm going to have diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer. Or find out that I have a rare incurable disease. I always think I have 3 months to live after that come back with that clip board. I honestly just expect the worst and I don't like people touching me.
-1	I'm always a little nervous that some previously undiscovered health issue will pop up, or that something embarrassing will happen during my checkup
1	The thought that something completely insane might be discover like cancer
1	I don't like the impersonality there often is when being examined. It feels, sometimes, like being a car or something else that is being checked for malfunctions, rather than a person: the way you are led to a room and have to sit around waiting for the doctor, for instance. It also feels somewhat invasive to be examined in that way, and that makes me self-conscious.
-1	sometimes i being in worry if there is anything wrong with me or if i am not completely healthy and so on
-1	I am most worried the doctor may come across a condition I was uware of, and that requires lots of treatment
-1	The unknown answer of what might be the issue. Unless Army doctors- then its the worry of laziness causing further harm. 
1	There is always the opportunity of hearing bad news.  The memory of hearing bad news in the past about my own health, or a loved one's health.  The idea that an appointment could lead to a scary or painful procedure.  Also, the possibility of financial loss.
-1	I may have lost a ton of weight, but I'm still fat. I still have man boobs, and I absolutely hate taking off my shirt ever. I hate talking to people in a closed room about what's wrong with me.
1	Because of how people can't do things with how the doctor's office and the results
1	I get worried and anxious when I go to the doctor due to the uncertainty of what is going to happen next.
1	"Because when I am there, it is usually because something is wrong that I do not understand myself and need answers for. This type of thing makes me worried because I get that fear of ""what is wrong""."
1	I just worry about what the doctor will tell me about my health. Whether or not any of my conditions have gotten worse or I have developed new health problems.
1	Afraid she might find something bad and I can't handle the news. I run from bad news and if I get bad news I don't know how I will handle it.
1	I get anxious when I worry about whether the doctor will assist me in a way that I personally agree with or if they will demand I do things that are out of my comfort zone, such as taking medications I do not wish to take or taking tests that I find to be dangerous.
-1	Nothing really.  I like my nurse practitioner and feel like I don't mind going to the doctor's office when needed. 
-1	The thing that makes me feel most anxious  when visiting the doctor's office is the possibility of him finding something wrong with me.
1	I'm worried that they won't believe me if I tell them that something is wrong. Sometimes I feel like I experience pain that they won't believe if there are not physical symptoms.  
-1	I feel anxious if my blood pressure is high or if I put on weight.I have a hard time maintaining my weight.
1	THINKING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. KNOWING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG AND MY LIFE MIGHT CHANGE JUST LIKE THAT.
1	I am always so afraid she is going to take my pain medictions from me or decrease my anxiety medication
-1	that he might lie to me in order to make me feel better
1	I hate the anual exams, well woman check-ups. They make me anxious and uneasy. I do dread them. I don't know why, I just do. I also hate mamograms. They make me anxious too. They hurt.
-1	
-1	nothing makes me anxious or worried at the moment because i really don't have a major medical problems that i need to be worried about
-1	I always expect something major to be wrong.  Haven't had that happen yet, but I just always assume bad news is coming.
1	the visit in general. I don't want to hear bad news
1	I feel most anxious or worried when I have symptoms that might indicate a serious health condition. One of my doctor's nurses is a little unfriendly, so I feel anxious if she is the one who takes my vitals or draws my blood. Also, I feel worried about catching the flu from other patients at the doctor's office.
1	Having to go through a prostate exam. I don't think that thongs shild go so bad after all.  Do you feel me? 
1	I just don't like long waits in the waiting room and I'm uncomfortable around the other patients in the room. I also don't like receiving bad news from the doctor, like I gained weight or my cholesterol or blood pressure is back up.
1	What makes me feel most anxious or worried is what the diagnosis of my health problem is going to be...I tend to get nervous sometimes when I am not sure what it is
1	First off, I am generally an anxious person, so that doesn't help.  Mostly for me, it relates to the fact that I am going because something is generally wrong, or I am looking for medical advice.  When I either know or suspect that something is wrong, but I do not know what, it easily makes me anxious.  Combine that with the fact that I always have some sort of idea how the visit will go, but having the visit never go that way, I get easily anxious about the visit.
1	this survey is funny. The medical situacion is critic, but me and my people having fun. Thank you for all, quick thoughs
-1	I am the kind of person who always gets nervous in a doctors office. I just get nervous about the fact that they could find something wrong.

The next thing I worry about is sitting in the waiting room with all the sick people.   Another thing that makes me anxious on the way to The Doctor's office is how long the wait is going to be in the waiting room.  Also if your blood pressure is going to be high when you 1st get there because all the waiting.
-1	Im always worried im going to have something major wrong with me or they will find something very wrong with me.  I also scared i may have an infection of some sort.
1	The fear of the unknown, the fear of something being worse than I thought, and most of all not being able to cure a symptom I currently have.
-1	I feel that there is very little to be anxious about, for me specifically, because I rarely have significant health issues.
1	Not knowing what the doctor is going to say or what the test results are going to be.  Needles and blood make me nervous
1	waiting times in the waiting room and in the exam room only to have a doctor come in and give you 30 seconds of their time.
1	When you see the dr you are thinking and wirrying about ehat is he she going to find. Sometimes the amounts of test you have to take. The amount of pain involved

1	I'm nervous to begin with and do not like going to doctors to begin with and then you add the added anxiety of them finding something wrong, so yes I do feel anxiety going to the doctor for a couple reasons.
-1	there is always the chance of the unknown no matter how healthy you feel or how well you think you are doing following your health Regine.
-1	I always have a fear in the back of my mind of finding something wrong about my health. Both sides of my parents have a history of diabetes, and my mother's side have a history of cancer so anytime I go for a check up I worry about finding out that I may have it.
1	I don't like going to Dr's offices.  I think of sick people and death when I go there.  I lost a child at 19 weeks of pregnancy which makes me even more anxious when I am in a Dr's office.
1	that i am going to sit there for hours waiting to get into see the doctor for a five minute appointment where i get no help at all
1	Being in the office for a long time. I don't like long hour waits. I like to be in and out  and ready to move on with my day
1	The waiting of course! and what he might find and the procedure he is doing, something out of the blue that was unexpected.
1	The news they will tell me or what they will try to make be a problem wrong with me when that isnt the problem.

-1	That he won't be able to fix the problem that I'm dealing with.
1	The general sense of invasion that examition brings, the thought of future discomfort or pain or inconvenience or tragedy, all waiting for me in that little room.

-1	What make me feel worried about go to the doctors is that I might got bad news that could ruin my whole life it i could die.
-1	Going to the doctor is like taking your car to the mechanic. There could always be something seriously wrong that will require time and money to fix. In this case, my health is the most important, so of course I am concerned the doctor would find something bad under my hood.
1	I am afraid that something will be discovered that has gone unnoticed, such as cancer! I am nervous at being inspected closely. I am nervous that something is wrong that will be missed or misdiagnosed. I am nervous about my body shape or life choices being judged. I am nervous about the financial cost. I am nervous that some drug will be recommended that I do not want to take or that will be expensive or will have side effects.

-1	That they want me to do something I do not want to do or Change  about my daily living.  Very little else would concern or make me anxious or worried. 
-1	Not knowing why I feel the way I am and is it a really problem or just I need to keep a better check on myself
1	I get really anxious about all aspects of visiting a doctor's office. I'm usually very nervous before I even get there. I dread getting weighed. I'm always worried that they will find something seriously wrong with me, even if I'm just there for a minor illness or an annual physical. 
1	I'm always afraid that he will find something knowing that I'm not a spring chicken.
-1	White coat syndrome. just going into the office, and the fear of the unknown.  Finding out something is really wrong.
1	not knowing how it will turn out. Unknown tests, drugs, reactions, news. I don't like having my blood taken, shots, or upsetting news (obviously). 
-1	
-1	I very rarely feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctors office. My doctor puts me at ease with any issues or concerns that may come up. The only times I have ever felt anxious or worried, were after having testing done, that could come back with negative results and indicate I have health issues. 
1	i have hypertension and when i go to the doctor, my bp is typically higher than outside the office. the thought of it going higher at the office makes it go higher at the office if you know what i mean. i also don't being weighed as i am currently overweight.
1	Since I'm getting older I start to worry that something will be wrong with my heart, or the doctor will say I have to drastically change my diet and all the good foods like cheeseburgers and milkshakes will have to be eliminated. It's mainly just my aging that makes me nervous that this will be the visit where something has gone wrong that I never even noticed.
1	i was a iv drug user i could get bad news about effects 7 years of use had on my body. it can be scary at times but i'm hopeful toreturn to good health
-1	What makes me most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office is the thought of them finding something that could lead to a terminal diagnosis such as cancer. I do smoke cigarettes (about a pack a day) so sometimes I worry that something would be found to indicate the need for more testing. Uncertainty makes me nervous if it's for something that could potentially be serious. I am generally not anxious or worried when going to the doctor's office though. 
-1	That there will be something wrong with me or something I didn't know about. The uncertainty of why I am there

1	Pap smears make me worried and anxious in a bad way when I go to the gyn but that's not often. Because I don't like people especially men looking at or touching my vagina 
1	My mind is thinking about all the dreaded diseases I might have since last visit. I think about friends illness and hope I don;t have them.
1	I usually feel anxious and worried when I am unsure of the outcome of a diagnosis. When I am going to see a doctor for a concern with my health and I don't yet know the diagnosis, that makes me very uneasy. The other thing that makes me worried about visiting doctors, is the doctor themselves at times. Because I don't know the doctor personally and I am unsure of what type of person they are and how they maybe professional or not.

-1	I don't think I'm actually a hypochondriac, but my mind always shoots to the worst possible scerio when something is wrong. I'm worried that I'll be too anxious to appropriately describe the issue I'm having and just hope that the doctor figures out what's wrong on his own.
1	usually I would expect a good report from my dr, however I have recently had a couple of things that haven't been going as I would have hoped, and therefor have coused me to be somewhat anxious.
1	i always seem to get bad news. i hate being told or wondering if i am doing things right. everything seem so cold and sterile.

To deal with this- I usually ask questions and try to get a satisfactory answers from Doctors and/or nurses. I also try to learn my options on the prescriptions to see if there is any other alternatives. for instance- the generic version of a branded medicine would make any difference etc. This sometimes help me deal with the level of being anxious or worried.
1	I wonder at what halfassed shit they are going to try and push on to me. The place I go is a little hick clinic. Nice enough people for around here but not well educated enough to suit me.
1	I have never been a health-minded individual and have been obese most of my life. I become defensive when I feel judged regarding my health. I am deeply worried about my health but much more afraid of finding out that something is seriously wrong.

It makes me nervous not knowing what I have of rmight need. The suspense of waiting for the results of and exam make me anxious.
-1	The things that could make me most anxious is that i am always pressed for time. The majority of the time when i go to the doctor it is a all day experience because the doctors office is so busy. SO i worry that i wont get out of there  on time to finish my day. I could also worry that there could be something wrong with me that is not fixable.

-1	I only feel anxious when I feel I have a problem that may require further visits. I have little or no anxiety with check ups or other tests. The only other times when I am anxious is when I have a problem so bad that it interferes with my life.
-1	The visit usually makes my blood pressure high.  I enjoy knowing that they are trustworthy. So I don't feel anxious or worried.
1	I rarely go into the office unless I have noticed something is very wrong with me. I generally tend to let things get to a bad point before reaching out for professional medical help.
1	For my mother, any visit to the doctor's office is a possible event filled with dread. Has the cancer spread to her brain yet? How long will she be able to breathe effectively before the tumors in her lungs over power her? For myself? I'm basically as healthy as a horse and entirely apathetic about it.
1	What makes me worried is i would not like nothing to be wrong with me. I be worried that my doctor would tell me that i have a disease or something like cancer.

-1	They advise me on weight loss as if it can be done over night or its really easy.
-1	I have no fears or worries of any diagnosis of any conditions I may I have. I do fear the lack of being told of anything I may have or the lack of proper research into symptoms I may have. I also distrust when I have procedures done on me and I'm told it's nothing. Especially after I research the finding they found and find there is some type of alarm to the findings they came up with.
1	When the doctor tells me I have strep throat and I need a penicillin shot in my buttocks. Also, when the doctor take to long to come back with my lab results.
1	My condition is serious and currently I am in remission but every time I have a new scan and go to the doctor there is a chance something could show up so I am anxious
-1	When I first started going to him it had been quite a while since I have had a primary doctor. I was very anxious about my test results. I had 2 serious issues. The first one is completely under control now. We are working on the second. This had decreased my anxiety. I guess my anxiety stems from not knowing about any issues I have.
-1	I have a condition that is called white coat syndrome. When I go to the doctor even though I do not feel different my bp rises. After I settle down I come out normal. I do sometime feel a little bit nervous when getting back blood tests but other than that I look forward to seeing my doctor. 
-1	It depends what i am going in for. i think that if i am already unsure about something regarding my health, the unease will already be there.
-1	Mentally I am relaxed, but even benign medical procedures like taking my blood pressure can produce stress responses in me.  It's also difficult when they take blood, my veins are uncooperative and so it's typically a difficult process
-1	just in cast I have to do something, by doctor's orders that's going to make me feel uncomfortable or place me in a negative position in the long run
-1	While logically I know that there's likely nothing wrong with me, the last visit I had involved being diagnosed with PTSD. It was a bit of a soul-crusher to have had that confirmed, because I sort of knew that I did for the month leading up to the visit.
1	When I go in for something where I'm not sure what the diagnosis is going to be.  Like in my latest example regarding the cyst found in my thigh.  When I went in for examination, I didn't know if it was going to be a tumor or cancerous or a blood clot.  If I was just going in for a physical checkup, it wouldn't be as nerve racking.  However, even then, you never know if they're going to find something wrong with you and that is always a little unnerving.
-1	the only thing that makes me anxious if when I have to get any type of shot or have to have my blood drawn. I think this makes me feel anxious as I never look forward to having this done. 
1	The most obvious answer for me would be either finding a potentially new problem or having an existing but controllable problem change or get worse.
1	I hate going because I expect the worst and I'm just totally uncomfortable sitting and waiting, I get anxious and bored pretty fast. Then I hate interacting with the nurse or other workers and the doctor himself. I always feel insecure.

1	That my condition might be worse than suspected and costly or difficult to treat quickly, and that the physician might try to unnecessarily exaggerate or drag out treatment.
1	I had cancer 8 years ago, so I naturally worry that something might develop, or perhaps secondary cancers from my treatment.  I also am embarrassed about my weight, although I am on a walking program and am doing the best I can.
1	"When you're in pain and it's strange, you get worried before you even get to the doctor. And if you're like me, you already been waiting a few days to see if it's going to go away. When you finally go to the doctor, you tell them every info you remember about your symptoms. Then the dreaded thought, they have to touch the spot that's been hurting for days. They leave to go diagnose you and leave you there for hours with just your thoughts. Finally they come back to say"" here's a prescription, let's see if this works."" Omg I almost died from worry."

1	Nothing that I can think of at this time. I just don't like going to the doctor even if I know that I have to.
1	Thinking that there's a slight possibility of receiving bad news is usually almost always nerve racking. 
-1	"Nothing. I don't worry or get anxious. Worry is a waste of time. Mark Twain said ""I have worried about a lot of things in my life, and some of them actually happened.""  People need to relax. If anything, maybe the bill would worry me, or that a treatment needed would be way too expensive to get. "

-1	I usually know what's wrong with my health.  but there are times when sometime good comes up. but I trust my doctor

-1	I don't feel worried or any of those traits in regards to doctor's appointment. I typically feel calm
1	Because to put it right out there - I don't well I am not used to, physical contact. I have been alone so long, I barely do more than a handshake. I never hug, never am close to anyone. So, when a doc is there checking and taking blood or all that, it is nervous. It is hard. Especially when I need to get an ultrasound on my testicles. As I said..... it is hard.
-1	Mostly i am anxious about my medical conditions and hoping they are not getting worse and hoping the changes i have made towards improving my health are working

1	Nothing makes me too anxious when visiting the doctor except hearing some really bad news about pretty much anything

1	I am always anxious & worried because I almost always have to give blood or recieve my medication intravenous. My veins are extremely small and I have rolling veins so that is why I feel the way I do.
-1	I will have to fight to get the doctor to acknowledge I'm a human being and listen to me. He never has time to actually listen. He hops on the first thing he sees on his phone and writes a prescription. That's worrisome for me. I know I will not get good treatment unless what I have is common and everyone is treated the same.
1	I think the biggest thing is that I always think the worst and assume I will get bad news a lot of times. It takes a lot for me to go to the doctor usually so when I do go I get nervous and anxious. 
1	I am worried that they will discover something that is wrong with me. I know i am healthy but there is always a suspicion that something is wrong and they will discover it. It just more nerves about having a bad disease discovered.

1	That they will give me bad news, and that the treatment will be something I'm uncomfortable with. 
1	I often worry that they will find something seriously wrong with me or that I am going to die.  Even though I feel ok, I always dread that they might find something that canât be cured or they canât help to heal.
-1	because i have to miss work. i dont like missing work for any reason. i also dont want to run into anyone i know.
-1	Because I will have to always take precautions to avoid any health problems and sometimes there are risks that are beyond my control that could cause a serious illness.

-1	When we're no longer young we are always fearful of a Dr finding some health problem that we may be uware of but I'm in extremely good health so I'm not really anxious when I see my PCP.

1	"I tend to be an anxious person in general and have a family history of high blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This often manifests in ""white coat syndrome"" when my physician or a nurse takes my blood pressure. It is usually off the charts the very first test, and sometimes it stays that way throughout the examination. This issue is further compounded as my employer/insurer has a ""wellness program"" that ties the outcomes of routine examinations with insurance premiums for the year, so there is extra incentive to maintain healthy numbers (with blood pressure being one of those numbers). For that reason, I record weekly blood pressure measurements to bring with me to examinations; unfortunately, my normalized recordings are not the ones that make it ""into the record"" for the wellness visit numbers..."
1	I've visited doctors who I don't feel take the time to listen to all my concerns and symptoms. Which was a real problem for me. It took years for My endometriosis to be diagnosed.
1	Knowing my previous health problems flaring up, not sure if the problem has progressed or if they have found a completely different problem to diagnose with a treatment system. 
1	Usually it's just dealing with the doctor and potentially telling them that they're wrong if they were to simply give me medicine with a thousand sides effects that hide the real problem one might have. 
-1	I think i'm pretty healthy, my doctor says so. So i don't really fell worried or anxious visiting him. Basically it's just the routine checkup, what can go wrong?

1	Sometimes I wonder if my blood pressure is up. I know I have gained weight quickly and wonder if that is a medical/emotional problem
1	That what the doctor diagnoses me with is serious or untreatable. Also, the environment itself in a doctors office usually makes me anxious or worried. 
1	I know I have an amazingly high pain tolerance. When I complain of pain, and am referred to a specialist for it. I know I will likely end up scheduled for surgery. It just depends how many hoops I have to jump through before I reach that point. I complained of neck and shoulder pain for 12 years. Begged for an MRI every appointment with the doctors. When I finally was sent for one. The MRI showed my neck was broken,

-1	The results of tests and what might be wrong with my body.
-1	Wondering if something is wrong
1	If I'm sick, I'm not sure what the diagnosis is, that makes me very anxious for obvious reasons. I'm most nervous when getting tested for STDs/HIV because I'm part of an at risk population, but I do my best to minimize that risk. I don't really get uneasy or uncomfortable talking personal bodily or hygienic stuff because to me that's expected in a medical setting.
1	When you visit a doctor's office, it's usually because something is wrong, unless it is for preventative purposes. The anxiety and worry are related to the uncertainty of your condition and the uncertainty of whether it can be treated, or what kind of treatments are available. There is anxiety and worry when visiting a doctor's office because the doctor might not be able to help you, they may not give a lot of time for your visit and rush to see another patient when you still feel unsure about how to proceed.

-1	I really don't get nervous unless it's the first time meeting a new doctor since you don't know what to expect

1	I worry that I will get news that I am afflicted with some disease.
1	The one thing that makes me feel the most anxious has been a couple times when doctors pushed medications instead of making sure I actually needed it.

I've wasted time and then you have to go somewhere else.
1	I really do not like being there in the first place and then having them tell me what I am doing wrong in my life makes it that much worse.

Sometimes there's a weird feedback loop when taking blood pressure where I'm almost nervous that if I'm feeling nervous about my blood pressure being high I'll get an inaccurately high reading, which makes me a little nervous.

Also my cousin's 18 year old son was just diagnosed with Cancer so I am now aware that anything can happen. 
1	I think the main thing is that I'm uncertain about what the outcome might be.  While for most of my life I have been extremely healthy, the past 6-7 years have been extremely rough physically, and that has contributed to my apprehension.
-1	Nothing. It's better to know than not to. I tend to think that mostly good things happen to me in life, because has been my experience thus far, so that is how I approach all situations...including visits to the doctor.
-1	What usually makes me nervous about going to the doctor's office is when there's something that i feel is wrong with me that's beyond a regular checkup. It doesn't really have anything to do with the doctor since it's mostly the situation that got me in to the office to begin with. But when there is something worse than usual, then everything from the wait in the waiting room and the patient room to just talking to the doctor/nurse is nervewracking

1	I absolutely detest anyone touching me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach and sends my mind reeling even just sitting here thinking about it. I don't want any doctor disregarding or disrespecting my body autonomy. I would 100% avoid any circumstance where a doctor could even touch my arm.
-1	i would have to say sometimes you just don't know what to expect sometimes just too much to expect but worrying if i will find something bad out

I also feel anxious when going through a breast examinations, a rectal exams, or Pap smear procedures--due solely to the physical nature of the exams.
1	Not know what they are doing to find or say about what they find. They always say something is wrong so they can push a pill or want you to come back and keep paying them. The health system isnt really designed to cure you because they would lose customers then.
-1	Because you don't know weather or not you are going to get good news or bad news about your health issues or what your lab reports are
-1	Just too see if I have been doing the things I suppose to be doing to make sure my health is good and stays on track.

1	I am pretty much constantly in pain or having some symptom or another, but I do not like to bring this up, even to the doctor. It was not looked well upon by my family growing up. You just toughed your way through things without whining.

1	The things that make me feel the most anxious or worried when I visit my doctor is I usually already know that it is going to be something bad, and I fear what I will be told and than the next course of action. I have many medical issues and most don't simply just go away on there own.

-1	Even though I'm comfortable at my doctors office and have known him for years, I always get a little anxious when going in for an exam.

-1	ususaly when i am there to learn about my blood work or to do a cancer check to make sure i have no more cancer
1	I am always uneasy in a doctors office.  I have never gone there for a good time and usually good news means that they have nothing bad to tell you.  I tire of hearing I am getting old and also the rotation of doctors with the current state of health care and insurance in the country.

-1	
1	I worry I will be scolded for having poor self-care. I worry that they will find out I am actually quite sick. Also, I am generally nervous around many people who are authorities and I have a strong desire to look as though I know a lot, but I don't actually know much about the medical field.

-1	I experience these feelings when certain test are recommended and I'm not sure what the outcome may be 
1	Mostly my weight. It has been an issue due to some of the medications I am on. I worry that I have gained weight each time I visit and that my doctor will comment on it. I also worry about the blood test results I have done each month and hope that they reflect that the medications I am on are working so I don't have to change medications yet again.
1	As a cancer survivor (10 years), I still worry about what a routine physical might find. As I get older, I also know that the likelihood of something going wrong becomes greater with each passing year. I know enough about medicine through my work to be a little bit of a hypochondriac!

1	I have had lab work previously before each visit. Most times the news is the same, sometimes it shows improvements in some areas of health.
1	I think it may be the atmosphere or the ambiance of the doctors office. Its too quiet and smells like disinfectant. Iâm always feeling a little anxious and nervous when I have an appointment even when itâs just a check up/physical. I donât know... Iâve never thought about why it is that I get nervous when I go to the doctors.
-1	I worry that my doctor is going to miss something serious because he is just going through the motions of another physical or exam instead of being meticulous and caring.
-1	What worries me the most is that one of my conditions has gotten worse, or needing to add another medication.
1	Not knowing If I am going to get good or bad news. Lots of sicknesses in my family that I always freak out and get nervous that I will catch something. I also don't know if the doctor will be 1% honest with me or even fully explain it to !y terms 
-1	I sometimes get nervous that I will get sick while I am there. If I am going to puke I would prefer to do it in the comfort of my own home.
-1	Visiting the doctors office rarely makes me feel anxious. If at some point I do feel anxious it might be because the doctor will tell me that I will have to undergo treatment that is not the most convienient for me at the time or I am unfortunately diagnosed with a condition that is not curable. 
-1	i really don't have feeling of being worried or anxious, i guess the only thing i would be worried about is blood test results.

1	Only that they might find something I'm not aware of. I am almost 60 so anything could go wrong. 
1	The doctor having bad news makes me feel worried or anxious. I don't trust doctors because they try to put a fear in people.
1	I wonder if they will find some kind of health condition I was not aware I had. I also wonder if they will judge or criticize me for things like not getting enough exercise or always eat nutritiously.  
-1	It's uncomfortable to be that vulnerable.
1	There is always the element of surprise that maybe something could be wrong but nothing I seriously allow to worry myself too much about.
1	What makes me most anxious about visiting the doctor is them finding something seriously wrong with me that cannot be treated or is very difficult to treat.
-1	I don't usually feel anxious or worried about going to my doctor. If there are problems, then I will deal with them when they arise. Only time I'm a bit apprehensive is if I need to see a new doctor.
1	I usually don't feel nervous about anything when going to see a doctor. The damage is already done I'm just waiting to find out what is wrong.
1	Just the act of going there.  The uncertainty of what could possibly happen and what the next steps would be.
1	As everyone does at some point I often wonder if they'll find something wrong with me. It's not generally the case, but it happens to people so sometimes I wonder.
-1	
1	The results may be life threatnening. Options may be limited. The cost outstanding. Insurance does not cover for it.
1	Just Them Telling Me That Something Bad Is Wrong With Me It Care Keep Your Worried Forever Man And That's Why I Try To Stay Healthy 
1	I feel worried because you never know what they could may tell you about your health. You could have a disease you never knew of or poor health in general 
-1	"When visiting the doctor, there's always a ""what if"".  I'm never scared or worried about my health, per se, but just if something is not feeling right or beginning to come on."
1	Just listening to what my Doctor is telling me about my impairments. There is usually never any improvement and no signs of possible or potential improvement. It is essentially my Doctor telling me that I will probably have these issues for the remainder of my life. 
-1	somethings I just feel anxious, I do not like to talk about myself or my issues and feel like maybe they will not have an answer for me or that they are too busy to care about what is going on

1	When the doctor wants to run more tests. I am also anxious waiting for test results. I am more anxious than worried. 
-1	I worry that I may have underestimated the seriosness of my condition. There is usually also the worry that the doctor might find something wrong with me that I did not even suspect.
-1	Having blood drawn out of my arm with a needle and checking my blood sugars are reasons to feel quite anxious.
-1	I hate going to the doctor it's just the anxiety of taking test and not getting the results that I'm supposed to geI hate going to the doctor it's just the anxiety of taking test and not getting the results that I'm supposed to get. I knowing that my primary doctor on th I knowing that my primary doctor or the nurse will be angry with me for not getting the results on supposed to have and not staying on top of my heels not working out or eating the correct or proper food.
-1	For the time I might be anxious if I don't  know what's wrong, but after I'm remember relieved. I leave feeling good that i went and everything has been explained to me and that a plan of action has been taken to help me.
1	That the doctor is just going to say anything. That doctors dont care to actually really examine a patient. They just have a goal to prescribe a prescription for anything and any reason.
1	I don't like feeling exposed when undressed. I am nervous about the tests.
1	Part of me worries that they may find some serious medical condition.  I also just find the whole thing awkward in general, sitting there undressed or half dressed.
1	You never know what they may find.  I always fear the cost of follow up appointments and the potential time that will be wasted.  Definitely not convenient.
-1	Actually, I'm not worried when visiting my primary care physician. On occasion, I have been concerned when visiting a specialist regarding what they might find wrong but that is short-lived as I am always determined to approach whatever issue by working with the physician to resolve it.
-1	It really depends on what I am going for.  Most recently I had to go because I was having knee pain related to an old injury.  When you go to a new dr and say you need strong pain killers some times they think you are just trying to get drugs
-1	I think it's the atmosphere of doctors offices/hospitals that make me anxious. It always seems to be associated with health problems and that makes me feel that I have problems.
-1	What makes me feel anxious is if the doctor comes back after doing blood samples and sa they found something unnatural in my blood 
1	I feel concerned that I will not get the treatment I need and it concerns me a lot.I wonder how I will get treated by the doctor.
1	"The physical vulnerability makes me antsy - I'm a very physically private person, so the examition itself usually makes me uneasy. And then of course there's the ""what if"" thoughts of what could be the worst-case scerio."
1	I do feel anxious at times that they won't know what is wrong with me or it will cost a lot of money to heal me.
1	I am an anxious person in general, and medical stuff makes me especially anxious. I think my fear is that the doctor will tell me that I have a serious health problem that I didn't know I had. I worry a lot about those types of things.
-1	I am most worried that they are not going to listen to what I am describing as my actual problem. And only listen to key words that I might say. 
-1	I don't normally feel anxious or worried when visiting my doctors office. I trust if there is a problem we would figure it out all together
1	I feel worried because I do not know if my health conditions has become better or worse.Sometimes I am even concern if they will add more medications for me to take.
-1	I have COPD. Each time I visit my doctor I half expect him to tell me my symptoms are getting worse and that the end is near.
-1	The long wait at times.
-1	Nothing I answered disagree to all. Nothing really bothers me in those settings I feel perfectly fine. 
1	It mostly isn't  a conscious thing, I just get this feeling of dread from being in hospitals even if I am not the one being treated, I don't really know why. but weighing myself causes anxiety because i am really fat and I know that the doctor is going to bring it up (which is their job so I am not saying it is wrong). I also have anxiety about my health so I am always nervous that they are going to find something wrong with me. Also if I am being honest there is an inferiority complex going on, doctors are successful and even though I know it's just in my head there is a feeling like the doctor is looking at me like I am a looser.
-1	Nothing I do not feel anxious or worried I have questions I want answered can speak openly and freely with doctor
-1	Not sure if they can help me or not or what might be wrong.  Hopeing the doctor will take their time and listen to me.
-1	What makes me nervous about being at the doctor's office is being around people who I think are sick.  I'm afraid I will get sick just by being there. 
-1	I feel most anxious when I am visiting the doctor's office when I am uncertain about what I am going through. I become even more anxious when I have to wait on results or if I am referred to a different specialist.
-1	I, like most people, have a bit of anxiety when going to the doctor. This stems purely from not knowing if something is wrong with me that I might not have noticed. I stay in shape, and have a healthy routine, but there is always the chance that something is lurking underneath. 
1	I am usually worried about what the doctor will say. I don't want to hear any bad news. I also worry that they won't find anything when I know there is something wrong. There have been times where my doctor would say that I was fine, but I knew I wasn't. I also am anxious about what type of tests they will do. My biggest fear is blood work. I usually know when I am getting it, but I always hope they won't do it. 
1	Most of the time I visit the doctor it's to find out why i am sick. When I am sick there is always a sense of dread that my condition may be far worse than I anticipate
-1	just that they will find something i dont know about or wont truly listen to me
1	I not usually anxious but I am concerned if there will be a problem or a need for medication. I don't like it when they ask you to come back for visits if you are fine.
-1	What makes me most nervous when going to the doctor is that I will get bad news that is not easy to fix with medicine or anything else quick and easy.
1	Everything my health is a big deal to me and people should no more and get healthy and eat right allway and work out
1	In have not been to doctors much in my life until a few years ago,  therefore my blood pressure always goes up when I see a doctor
1	I fear the end result or diagnosis.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried. On the contrary, I want to find an answer to why I feel so bad, or something that will help me. Unfortunately, my concerns go largely ignored.
1	That my knowledge of my body and my views about medicine and disease will not be respected. That I will be forced into treatments that run counter to my beliefs. That I will be abused and put through unnecessary procedures or tests.
-1	I worry sometimes that I will explain something badly pertaining to my medical condition or forget something important even if I write it down or even say too much thereby causing my doctor to send me in for tests or more prescriptions.
1	Really, just waiting and taking time to sit in an office. Also, thinking what the doctor may tell me could be wrong or other health concerns.
-1	I get most worried that I'll be told I have a serious medical condition of some kind, particularly cancer. My family doesn't have a history of cancer or anything, but some of my behavior throughout my life with substance abuse has led to what I think is a higher risk of certain cancers, so that is what makes me most anxious about going to a doctor. But it's not something I dwell on.
-1	I just don't like doctors offices or hospitals in general.  I have never had any health issues so I am not afraid something is wrong with me.  I just have never liked them.
1	I don't really know what it is, I don't think it is the doctor themselves, but rather just the entire experience. I go to a hospital when I am not feeling well, so in my head, everyone is wondering what is wrong with me or why I am there. Plus, I do not want to have a time where I go to the doctor and something is very wrong with me. 
1	I'm nervous I might have something serious. Or thatnive waited to long to correct a problem that I currently have.
-1	the off chance that I will hear something I wasn't expecting, that tests have shown some terrible or incurable disease or I am much more sick than I thought
1	You mother and she said she was the first to unscramble and the aunt best mother ever heard of the kids and she was just amazing at night time to go sleep and sleep on a break with my friends and she was literally talking to my mother about to go shower then 
-1	I am afraid that something may be wrong.  Or if something is already wrong, that it may not be easily resolved. 
-1	You never know what the doctor may find. I am getting older and have friends with serious health problems . So far I'm in fairly good health.
-1	I just cannot be sure what they may discover even if I am feeling okay. It gives me a feeling of uncertainty.
-1	I am sometimes worried that I'm not going to pass one of the tests and will have some sort of condition. Before going in, I feel like I don't know how healthy I am. 
-1	Just the waiting in the office to be seen and hearing everyone else cough and sneeze makes me anxious
1	I feel anxious or worried because I am going to the doctor.  I think anyone would worry especially if the doctor tells them there is something wrong.
1	I have panic disorder so I'm almost always anxious and worried. But I don't like to think that my doctor will find something termil like cancer.
-1	I don't really get anxious or worried, I just get bored with the long wait and the hassle of it.  The only time I've felt anxious at a doctor's office was when I was getting my cheek biopsy because they were thinking it was skin cancer (it was). And then the surgery and reconstructive surgeries made me feel anxious because I was worried about scarring.
1	Im anxious when I go to the doctor sometimes because I dont know what to expect when I go there. In the back of my head I feel like everything is going to be fine but you never know.
-1	simply my reaction to being in a doctor's office.  especially troublesome because there are no windows.  the problem is the environment, not the doctor or the nurses.  and i detest getting my weight checked (i am overweight) and hate the blood pressure cuff-it hurts
1	I do not like to be touched by people, so being examined is extremely stressful to me.  I am also a nervous person in general, so it does not take much to get me worked up.  I tend to be pessimistic, so it is easy for me to assume the worst about health conditions.  I (and members of my family) have been brushed off when we did bring up medical complaints, so I tend to worry whether the doctor will take my complaints seriously.     
1	I most feel anxious and worried that I wouldn't get the right diagnosis. Sometimes, my problems are ignored and the doctor usually wants to tell me what's wrong with me, instead of me telling her what's wrong with me.
1	"I think what makes me feel the most anxious is when I don't know what's wrong with me but my gut is telling me that I know more about what is actually wrong than what my doctor knows.  Sometimes I wish instead of just treating a million different symptoms, they'd just treat the cause or say ""Look honestly, I don't know what's wrong"".  "
1	I am not sure why I feel like this. It is a general feeling that I have always had. Probably mostly the smell and the idea that I will be in pain ( a shot or a pap smear).  And then recently just frustrated that the doctor will treat me like my situation is stupid.
1	When I'm visiting my doctor's office I feel most anxious or worried about my AC-1 reading, blood pressure, high cholesterol and my blood pressure
-1	I always wonder what the blood work will show.  So far, I am OK and in very good health for my age and have no symptoms of any sort.
-1	I never want to experience pain. Or if there is pain I want to be warned about it. Of course I also don't want to find out bad things, or feel embarassed by answers I give. But I try to be honest.
-1	I think the doctor might not understand my condition. I also think that they may rush to quickly to conclusions or not fully recognize what is going on.
1	I do not like sitting and waiting and then being rushed through the exam as if I really don't matter.  My time is just as imprtant and for the doctor to only give a couple of minutes turning you over to a nurse pract. just isn't right
-1	I get anxious because i'm always afraid that they are going to tell me that something  is wrong and need to change something. 
-1	I'm anxious that there might be something seriously wrong with me. I hope that every time I go to the doctor it's not something very concerning going on with my health.
1	A doctor, whether they like it or not, has a certain amount of power over their patients, and I have a lot of trouble dealing with situations where people have power over me (and I have been justified in that concern). It's stressful having to be in situations of uncertainty or where I don't have the control I want.
1	What makes me feel anxious or worried in a doctor's office is that first of all I have to take off my clothing and be examined by someone of the opposite sex and you just don't know what's really going on with you and so you're anxious to know and a little bit worried as well.
1	I am usually nervous about what they will tell me that I have.  The last thing you want to hear when you see the doctor about having headaches is that you have brain cancer.  I seem to always think the worst.

-1	I just have no faith in any of them and feel I'm going to have to visit at least one more time permitting to get a second opinion and they always say it's something else so then you have to figure out which is correct which means a third opinion or simply suffering until your body kicks the ailment itself.
-1	I sometimes get nervous about talking about an embarrassing symptom that I might be experiencing, or I get worried that an serious illness might be diagnosed in tests. 
1	Before I switched doctors, I felt I wouldn't be listened to; now, as I am awaiting test results, I'm concerned about what will be discovered, and what the next steps will be.  That's why I switched PCPs, it's my body and my health and I need my questions and concerns acknowledged.

Alein 
-1	If I have something new that's wrong with me and I'm already concerned, then yes, I am nervous going to the doctor, but it doesn't have anything to do with my physician. It just means I know that something is wrong and I'm nervous to find out what it is.
-1	i think that i feel relax and in all moment is propably that  my doctor speak good. i like so much. it s a feel normal
-1	What could I do if I have a certain illness of sickness and what would I do with myself and my family.
-1	It's not really the visit, it's when they sent you a letter and tell you not to worry about something and the don't worry is in Bold Letters and they tell you not to worry.
1	I'm afraid of what he might tell me is wrong. I'm afraid that I am not taking care of myself well enough. I am afraid that my heart is getting worse, and there is not much that I can do about it. I am afraid that I will not make the right decisions that will ensure me a long life.
-1	I am worried that my primary care physician might find something new, especially when I am aging and gain more problem with that.

-1	The only concern I have when I go for a visit is wondering if I am going to have a shot or need to draw blood because I hate needles
1	I thing that has always gotten me is the unknown of what the doctor will tell me. Sometimes my blood pressure will be up and I will have to wait until I calm down.
1	You never know what is wrong, I get nervous going to the dr with a  complaint not knowing what it is.
1	possibility of their being something seriously wrong with me; judgement from the doctor.
1	I am concerned that they will give me the wrong medication which will result in something that can not be reversed.
1	im scared what may be wrong with me .im scared what may happen .i dont like shots ..some test bother me 
1	The thought of what could be found or diagnosed. I have not had much health scares up to this point but I am aware I am getting older and things are bound to happen. Both of my parents are both still living and very healthy for the most part.
1	Whenever I get a physical exam of course I get anxious because anyone can have hidden problems within their body and you never know what may be found at each exam. So as much as I want to stay ahead of the game I dread it every time.
-1	Concern that the Provider may find a condition that would adversely affect my quality of life. Also, it is a little unnerving to have someone see you all or partially disrobed. 
1	It's not workin the best sites that are coming the best sites that are coming out for the best thing
-1	Just general anxiety because I've experienced a lot of incorrect diagnoses, and as a result, been prescribed medicine that has a very negative effect on me. I worry about not being listened to. I dread the patient blame that I've experienced.  
1	My anxiety disorder makes me feel anxious about almost everything. I feel a lot less anxious with my primary care than most of my specialists though.
1	Because I always overthink things and I start to think something is wrong with me when there's nothing wrong
-1	In case I am feeling bad about something that I think is the worst case scerio and I will not find out until he has examined me or ran some tests. Worrying is mostly in my head and not a result of the doctor himself.
1	The thing I worry about most when seeing my doctor is potentially finding out that I have a serious problem and will need surgery. Just the thought of surgery terrifies me!
1	Even though I am feeling all right I always wonder whether or not the doctor will diagnose me as having some sort of an ailment.
-1	I am most worried there will,be something discovered. Even so, I maintain a yearly physical and bloodwork.
-1	There is a tendency to look for trouble and anticipate health problems based on statistics that have little to do with me or how I take care of myself. I don't like the tendency to try to instill fear in me where I am not having issues.
1	Just that I never know what they are going to say. Also that I may not agree with what they say or they may want me to do things I don't want to do. It's just that unforseen things can happen.
-1	I feel anxiety when I have to wait for my turn and if I get some blood work done not knowing the results right away.
-1	I don't feel overly anxious or worried when visiting a doctors office. I go often so I am familiar with a lot of test procedure that are done. 
-1	If that when I do go in for something minor he has to have a sit down with me in order to mention something serious.
1	I want a job I apply every day in nothing I been out of work for 7 months in it's driving me crazy I want better out of life but it's hard when no one want to give you a chance

1	I feel that way ANYTIME i visit a doctor or dentist, especially if I am having a physical or lab work done.
-1	No really very worried. He is easy to talk to. He does seem to rush me out so sometimes I have to really think before i get in there. Never have to wait much.
-1	What makes me anxious is that my doctor finds something really wrong with me. That would be one of my biggest fears, and to be honest is what makes it harder for me to get a check up from my doctor. Though my doctor does his best to make me feel that I am as comfortable that I can be. No one really wants to hear any type of bad news. Once I hear that everything is fine with my health from my doctor then that is when all of my anxiety disappear. That is what worry about the most.
1	usualy its about test results and up followup test that are needed  at the time of appointment, also when its time to discuss new treatments to use or try
1	Not knowing what the results will be. Worrying about how the medical bills will be paid and what will happen to my loved ones if I get bad news from the doctor.
1	I am always worried in unfamiliar situations, and doctors are people I do not know well that have to get close to me and ask personal things about my life.
-1	I dont like doctors at all. I don't fully trusy them. I have had bad experiences My blood pteasure sky rockeys soon as. I go to the dr I jaye going
-1	Only slightly anxious when getting a Pap smear done or when I was pregnant and getting checks for dilation. It's not particularly comfortable for me to have someone down there and the procedures are sometimes slightly uncomfortable.
-1	The thought of what if she finds something that i am not expecting or something that will be expensive to treat or fix.
-1	I really dont have any anxiousness at any of my doctors office visits usually. The only time there is anxiousness is if my doctor orders bloodwork to be done. While the procedure itself is easy, the before hand is what gets me anxious. 
-1	I feel that my doctor might tell me something about a condition that I may have that might debilitate me over a period of time.
1	I'm anxious about being around people in general, and going to the doctor is not too much better. I am in good health thankfully, so I usually only go in for minor stuff.
-1	I am always worried about getting bad news or bad test results. Doctors offices always just make me feel uneasy. 
1	The uncertainty of the potential outcome is what worries me most.  That uncertainty stems from a fear that something may be terribly wrong with me. Along with that, there's always the fear that either way, I'm going to have to undergo frightening procedures that may include getting needles (I have a phobia of them).
1	Oftentimes I am very worried that something will be wrong with me, even if there is no symptoms of something present. 
1	if they are truly going to be able to help me.if they want to answer my questions.nothing else makes me worried at the doctors office..
-1	I'm worried that are going to find something horribly wrong about my health.  I am scared to receive bad news.  I'm also concerned that the doctor will recommend treatments I am uncomfortable with.  Also I am concerned the doctor will be irritated if I question such treatments.  
1	If I have some unknown pain I might think it is cancer or some other bad disease, but I have been lucky that I haven't had these conditions.
-1	If not a regular checkup, just a bit anxious about what the diagnosis will be that day. Possibly, how much the prescription will be.
-1	Nothing makes me feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.  I have no problem going into the office.
1	Not knowing if something is wrong with me or that something is wrong with me. Fear of receiving needles. 
-1	I don't like being poked and prodded, disrobed, made to wait long periods of time in the exam room.
-1	Probably what most people fear which is they may find some underlying illness that would be serious.
1	In all honesty, what makes me the most anxious is walking into the doctors office and sitting there alone waiting for my doctor to come. There is nothing more that puts me on edge like that.
-1	There's not really alot that would make me worried about actually seeing the doctor. If anything I would be the most worried about why I am going to the doctor. If I dont know what is going on and it is something that has been bothering me, it more about the unknown. The other thing I would be nervous about is if I have to go to the doctor last minute and I have to see another doctor that I havent seen before. When you see your regular doctor there is already some trust there so seeing someone else doesnt feel right to me and it is hard to trust them because they are not my doctor. Lastly, when I go for my yearly exam it just makes me nervous because of the discomfort. 
1	First of all coming to appointment on time and waiting for up to an hour for the doctor. Then expectation of lack of details after exam.
-1	That symptoms I may have been experiencing turn out to be something serious.  That I can't afford treatment.
-1	the possibility of hearing bad news from him and having to go home worried about my health situation
1	I am worried there might be a problem I'm not aware of, especially high blood pressure or thyroid issues which run in my family. I also feel like the nurse and doctors at the practice I go to don't really listen to my concerns much.
