-1	Sometimes they are in a hurry to get to the next patient and make quick, sp judgments that do not apply.  Sometimes they are much more interested in what insurance plan you have than your well being.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is adequate. He does listen and try to help with my medical issues. However he also refuses to try new procedures and treatments that might help me.
-1	With my PCP, there has been a long relationship, he know my needs/wants and is able to accommodate them in most instances. If I did not trust my PCP, I would get a different one. 
-1	I trust them that they think they are doing the right thing. What worries me is what they could be doing wrong.
1	My primary care physician was able to correctly diagnose a rare inner ear condition that I have.
-1	Some doctors are in it for the money
-1	I primarily trust my doctor. She seems to be interested in what's best for me, not necessarily what's fastest or most convenient.
1	He has been our family physician forever, I trust him to make decisions that positively affect our family. 
-1	I don't really have an opinion of most doctors. Some are good and some are shitty.
-1	My doctor listens and allows me to complete my sentences (doesn't interrupt). My doctor asks me pertinent questions.
-1	Because I do feel that sometimes doctors pushes way to much medicines
1	They have given me the proper care I have needed up until this point.
-1	I trust my family doctor greatly. I've been using him since I was a teenager. I never had a problem with him.
-1	I'm usually a pretty healthy individual, so I only ever go see him for my regular annual physicals. I really have no reason to doubt what he tells me, since I'm a very low-maintenance person health wise.
1	I trust my primary care physician.  I have been seeing her for 17 years so I completely trust her as a doctor. 
-1	I more or less trust my doctor. I think it has primarily due to how she treats me. She's very nice and that inspires trust.
-1	My dr. won't let me ask a lot of questions. Like my diabetes medicine. I tried asking about getting something else but he told me no. I wish there was a way that I could learn more
-1	My doctor tends to diagnose most problems as the same thing so I don't always agree with all he says.
1	I trust my Doctor because I have been with them for a long time. They have always gave me accurate information and diagnosed problems with relative ease. I have never had an issue that resulted from any decision they have made regarding my plan of care.
-1	Just started seeing this doctor and they harp on and on about needing to lose weight.  I get the feeling that they would blame any issue I'm having on my weight and not want to investigate further.
-1	I trust my primary care physician when we talk about what could be wrong, and early treatments.  However I always go online and take a look about what I can find and see what other options are.  I know that the health system is not perfect, and I try to minimize doing anything unnecessary.
-1	I feel that they generally are trying to rush you out of the office and don't really care that much.
-1	I've only seen my doctor once for a physical and she seemed a little dismissive of my concerns. I was told by a different doctor I may have a condition that requires a simple blood test but she stated that it was unnecessary and ignored my symptoms. 
-1	It's not necessarily that I don't trust my doctor but  I think she's far too rushed for such a serious matter. She is very casual and nonchalant about things that are of great importance to my life. She brushes off side effects/symptoms as if they are normal every day things but then puts me on medication to alter them and brings up having to have heart surgery. I am getting mixed messages and it makes me unsure of the severity or what she is thinking about course of treatment.
-1	I trust my physician to a point. The only thing I don't like is getting my blood pressure taken, and then I don't get told immediately what it is. I need to have this information.
1	My doctor has never given me a reason not to trust him
-1	I trust them because I have been with them since I was a kid. However, their practices seem a little bit outdated compared to others.
1	I have been going to the same doctor for 40 years.  I completely think he understands me and has my best interests in mind.
-1	Overall I have slight trust in the medical world. I think my doctor is persuaded by large pharma companies and I think a lot of the times they do things that are easier or make more money.
-1	They have gotten prominent degrees and I have good reason to trust them.
1	I trust my PCP because she paid attention to the fact that I had a goiter, when no one else would, and she's treating my hypothyroidism, when no one else took it seriously.
-1	I trust my doctor because it seems he always has my best interests in mind. He doesn't lie to me as far as I know. He also doesn't just push medication on me, he tries to understand what I actually need.
1	I trust my doctor because I have a long relationship with her, she has shown me that she is capable. She has helped me many times.
-1	I haven't had a lot of experience with my new doctor that would allow me to build a proper relationship.
-1	I view them more of a guide than an expert on everything. For more common occurrences, I believe he has his way of doing things, which isn't necessarily the only way or even the best way. 
-1	it depends on the person. not all doctors are good
1	I picked my physician based on ratings and reviews and when I met with her I realized and I could trust her.
1	In general, my primary care physician has been a very good fit for me.  He does work in a very busy practice, so I can imagine that he might overlook something in my care, but I have not seen him do so in my dealings with him.
1	The first time I went to see my primary care physician he spent a lot of time with me getting to know about my problems. He sat down, looked concerned, and wanted to know more information so that he could help me. He also listens to me when I have a different medication request and he is very easy to work with.
-1	I usually trust my doctor. Sometimes when he is rushed he doesn't give me the attention I ask for. For example, I had concerns over side effects from medication and he was in a hurry so shrugged it off. 
-1	I feel my doctor is knowledgeable and genially concerned with my health and well being. He is a caring person and isn't worried about how much money he can make.
-1	I have gone to him for several years.   he takes time to listen and gives useful feedback.   
-1	Not a special reason
1	I have built up trust with my doctor because I know that they are being honest with me. I have been going to them for a long time and they always seem to have my better care in mind.
-1	I'm not crazy about him, but I'm on Medicaid and few good doctors. take it.
-1	I trust that my doctor is doing the best he can. I think he is rushed and overworked though and perhaps could just miss things in haste. 
-1	I trust my doctor's motives; I don't think his knowledge is always complete.  I live in a relatively small town and use a primary-care physician simply to order things like routine cholesterol screenings, and perhaps as a first source of information about things I can't figure out myself. If I had a significant medical problem, I would try to drive somewhere else and see a specialist.
-1	My primary care physician is not interested in my care.  He just wants me in and out so he can get to the next patient or have sometime off in between patients.  He only ever tells me one option even if I ask for another option he will just tell me the first option was better.
-1	They work for a business just like anyone else. You can't trust them more than you trust any salesman.
1	I have seen my same doctor for a long time. He always has my best interest in mind. I have always been able to rely on his judgement. 
1	I go to him because I do not understand enough about what is wrong to make a decision. If I didn't trust my doctor, I wouldn't have gone
-1	I really want to trust my doctor but I think we have gotten away from the family physician model and now we just see anyone.  And each doctor is different so you basically always start over at square one each visit
-1	I don't trust doctors in general because most of them don't take their own advice on eating/exercise. Most of them also just flat out laugh in your face when you decide to take control over what happens to your body and just don't follow their instructions blindly. Doctors that I have been to in the past have been pushy for me to get certain shots or things that I have researched and decided I don't want. 
-1	They tend to go for the easiest and quickest solution possible so they can see as many patients a day as possible. They are not after helping people, they are after making money.
1	My doctor will always lay out several options if I have a problem and she will go over all of them with me and tell me the pluses and minuses to each one and then she will help me to make the best choice for what I need and if she disagrees with something I have chosen she will tell me why and then say what she thinks would be a better choice
-1	I trust my PCP to an extent, but my full confidence and faith does not rely on man--but on my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
-1	I don't distrust my physician. However, they are often rushed to get to the next patient so I don't always trust that they are being as thorough as possible.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest with me. If I had any problem in the past he always told me my options and explained the consequences. 
1	I know him personally so I know he'd tell the truth
-1	I think for the most part my doctors are honest. However, I still factor in my own opinions. 
1	My PCP is very thorough in every appointment and takes the time to not only discuss options, but also make sure that there is no pressure to pick a particular option since it is my treatment. 
-1	It's all about the money, not the patients... they are just a sick-people mill.
1	She has never lied or led me in the wrong direction.
1	I feel my doctor explains his decisions fully and gives me the opportunity to take part in the process. I feel he is intelligent and I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	I believe he's a good guy I generally trust him. Gut reaction
1	I trust my doctor because the information he has provided has been accurate and in line with any additional testing I have had done. 
-1	I don't trust them. They've screwed up before.
-1	I trust him as a person but I'm not sure if I can fully trust any doctor. I've seen a lot of documentaries and read a lot about the health care system in regards to Black people. I don't believe they always have my well being in mind. 
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. She has always been very helpful. She is always willing to listen to my thoughts and concerns and is never forceful in her suggestions.
1	I really like my primary care physician. He is never in a rush with even though he may be busy with patients. I ask a lot of questions and he always answers them. He gives me his thoughts but allows for me to make my decision on my own
-1	He is very young but seems to be engaged with his patients 
1	I trust my doctor because he is a professiol and knows what he's talking about. He has never led me wrong so far.
1	I have just never had any problems. I've been seeing the same doctor for years and years. I feel like there is no reason to not trust her.
-1	I distrust because Dr's are human too.
-1	My doctor takes time to listen and try to explain things to me.  She seems very thorough in here assessment of my situations and has not steered me wrong yet in health decisions.
-1	I trust my PCP because a previous Dr had misdiagnosed me, so I went to my current Dr. for a second opinion.  He immediately sent me to the ER and it ultimately saved my life.
-1	I have a tumor in my jaw and there are treatments out there for it, but it seems like the surgeons try to persuade me to have surgery without being open to other options. Only one has told me about other options.
-1	i DONT THINK SHE HAS TIME TO LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS. SHE ONLY WANTS TO TREAT ONE LITTLE THING WHEN i THINK THEY ARE ALL CONNECTED. SHE GIVES MEDS TO QUICKLY
1	My doctor takes the time to sit with me and make sure I understand what he is saying.  He has day with me doing research on medication and takes my opinion seriously. 
-1	I think they are very busy and default to common diagnosis.  Seems like it takes a few follow ups before they go into any depth.
-1	I have not had any problems with my doctor. The only thing i don't trust or have a problem with is when i think something needs to be checked or im worried about someone it is brushed off and not taken seriously.
-1	I find that often doctors just do whatever is needed for them to get from patient to patient (take as little time as needed) and sometimes just don't listen to what their patient is saying to them.  I can understand their busy schedule but sometimes the care doesn't seem persol, just rushed.
1	I really trust her because she listens to me and takes my views and opinions into account. She also is very smart and thinks out loud with me about options to address my concerns rather than just deciding on an option for me.
-1	Most doctors really want to help. Though there might be some out there that don't want to help. Those are the kind that are in it for the money. But most doctors can be trusted
-1	He's fine.  I generally trust him or I wouldn't go to him. He's honest but that doesn't mean he knows everything or is up to date on the latest treatments.  He's not afraid to refer me to a specialist, which I appreciate.
1	My physician seems concerned about my health. She is willing to talk to me and takes my concerns into consideration.
-1	"I just sometimes feel that my doctor and doctors in general are in a rush. They do what they always do to treat certain problems. If their treatment doesn't work, then ""oh well."" I've had several medical issues that I've gone to doctors for over and over and I just don't get any real concern or any improvement. No persol care, so I just don't have a high level of trust."
-1	I grew up around a lot of christain science folks and saw how healthy they are. most long term medication has consequence and I avoid it. Doctors are trained to treat symptoms, not the problems cause
1	I have been seeing the same primary care doctor since I was a child. I have complete faith in my doctor and will always take his suggestions and recommendations to heart.
-1	she's been the only doctor that has found an antidepressant that didn't give me side effects
-1	I trust them because of their experiences and knowledge 
1	Basically if I or my family have complaint about our health we will go to our family doctor. We trust our family doctor, if he ask us to see specialist we will do.
1	My doctor can relate to me and anybody else for that matter. She listens to me and my concerns and make sure that I have little to no worries. 
1	I have had a long-term relationship and we communicate well. I have never had any issues with this doctor.
-1	I trust them for the most part but they do seem to make sp judgements and not to go in depth as i would like
1	My physician has helped me every time I had a problem. She has given me the right treatments and made me feel better. I have no reason not to trust her at this point.
1	I trust my doctors because every time I had a problem with my health she steered me in the right direction 
1	She is knowledgeable and up to date on the latest research. She is caring and attentive as well. 
1	This doctor is a colleague and friend of the family. He was once my pediatrician and pediatrician to my younger sister that is now 25. He is also the pediatrician to my children as well. I can always go to him for a second opinion if needed. 
-1	I would suspect that a doctor that is engaging in activities that would lead to people questioning their legitimacy in their decisions wouldn't still be able to be a physician. All my physicians that I've ever had seemed to genuinely care about wanting to treat patients to the best of their abilities.
1	I feel that my doctor and I have a good relationship and that we can trust each other to work through any problems that might arise. I feel that my doctor knows that I want to know how my health is going and what I need to change in my life.
-1	Sometimes it feels as if they just want to get through with you and onto the next patient.
-1	Recently I was diagnosed with Lung Cancer. I've been telling my Dr. I had problems but he kept saying it was bronchitis. He got it wrong.
1	Because he saved my life. He was very good indiagnosing my illness.
1	They've never given me a reason to not trust them.
-1	I have been seeing them for many years.
1	I trust my doctor because he knows a lot more than me. He has vast experience, I have none.
-1	They are in it for the money. They do not actually care.
1	I have been with my doctor long enough for him to know my history. I think he always chooses the best path for me and we work together on long term plans for health. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has a good education and asks me plenty of questions. I have never had a problem with him.
-1	My physician has helped me in positive ways thus far, but I never like to put my complete trust in anyone because you just never know. 
-1	I don't really trust my primary care physician because he doesn't tend to remember information from visit to visit and he seems quick to throw a medication at any complaint without considering other options.
-1	i trust them because i have used them for years and they have no reason to be dishonest to me
-1	I feel about average about these things. I think there are goo physicians but I also think some don't take things seriously. 
-1	I don't really trust doctors because in the United States, where I live, healthcare is a for-profit industry. Doctors are basically no different than salesman, and, selling products myself, I know what goes into trying to get people to buy a product. It's not honest; it's not about care; it's about money. I also think many doctors are not realistic about the way people live their lives.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always done right by me. He answers all my questions and listens to my concerns.
1	My doctor has always been very honest about everything...even if I might not want to hear it.  I feel like we have good, honest conversation and I feel comfortable discussing anything with him.
1	my doctor have decades of experience and it great at treating me correctly and with the right medication
1	I think they have the knowledge to know what is wrong and it seems reasoble about what they are telling me. I see no reason to distrust them until they prove me wrong.
1	I'm not an expert. I defer to my doctor because they are far more qualified to tell me about my health than I am. 
1	He took an oath to make sure his patients are cared for to the best of his ability. He went to school for years to get to where he is, and that means it's persol for him.
-1	i do trust him for the most part. in the past there were instances where me and some others have doubted him but as he grows older he seems to have more of a better understanding of things now.
-1	My primary PCP is awesome. She answers all my questions, takes time with me and knows me and my family. I trust them. 
-1	I've had the same primary care doctor my whole life, he's never done anything to make me feel like he isn't trustworthy or qualified.  He knows me very well (and my family) and I feel like I can trust him to do what's best for me.
-1	Overall, I do have some base trust in doctors. I recognize their position, and what it would take for them to make it there. Obviously, they've gone through extensive schooling and are well experienced. Thus, I should at minimum, respect their opinions and strongly consider them.
1	I really like my current doctor.  He's younger than me, which is a little weird, but he is very open minded, more so than me.  He always gives me different  altertives  on how to treat myself 
1	We have a great relationship where he fields my questions appropriately. He also understands my background when giving explations.
1	I trust my primary physician because they always walk me through all of my options with any issue I may be having. I never feel pushed into taking medicine or doing something I am not comfortable with. They answer all my questions and make me feel secure and knowledgeable in my health choices.
1	Always honest with me, asks me questions to really know what's going on and to also ensure I understand
-1	I HAVE NO REASON TO TRUST MY DOCTOR. HE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN HIS BOTTOM LINE. I NEED TO CHANGE DOCTORS
1	My doctor has always given me a real prognosis and I appreciate that. My clinical doctor has always checked my neck and given me through physicals to make me feel at ease. Any bumps or pains are always checked, and he makes me feel comfortable. 
1	Doctors care about people, thats why they do what they do. They are properly trained and can generally be trusted.
-1	Primary care physicians literally couldn't care less about what you have to say or the symptoms you have. They only care about the blood work. They want you in and out as fast as possible. Primary care physicians live to get off at 5. 
-1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for several years, and she is well known and thought of in our small community. I know her outside of the office as well. I fully trust her to help me solve any medical issues, or to at least help direct to any specialist I may need.
-1	My doctor is relatively new, and I had not been in a few years. I was very nervous, because I have never liked going to the doctor, hospital, etc. She was so easy mannered, understanding and really listened to my concerns. I liked that, and have been going back ever since for regular check-ups/ins.
-1	My doctor has never tried to push any medications on me. He is more likely to send me home and tell me to give it a few days than he is to prescribe a treatment. He's a no nonsense kind of guy.
-1	Because medical knowledge is still limited but doctors seem to think they have fil solutions, when in fact a lot of medicine is still trial and error. 
-1	If I didn't trust them I would stay home. Ginger!
-1	Sometimes I fear that the pharmaceutical industry makes the decision what pills I get, rather than my persol doctor. I trust my doctor in terms of surgeries and maybe pain magement but outside of that, I wouldn't take any pills they recommend. 
-1	I wouldn't have complete trust in anyone over decisions regarding my health.  I think it's important to verify things and get second opinions to make sure I have as much information as possible.
-1	Ultimately, I trust my primary care physician. He has more knowledge than I do and a medical degree, so I will trust him or get a second opinion if it were a really big deal.
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about what's good for me. He would not knowingly do something that would violate my trust in him.
-1	He seems capable, but not particularly out of the box or persol.  He seems a little confused and passive when I talk to him, but mostly that's because he's giving me basic info and agreeing with me.  There's also nothing particularly wrong with me, I just go for checkups, so it's not like I've really strained his abilities.
1	I just do? He gives me good vibes, he knows what he's talking about. I feel at ease and comfortable with the care that I get.
-1	I feel that most doctors are there to meet their bottom line.  They care more about the money they can make than the people that they see.  
-1	I don't trust them because they have god complex.  I don't trust them because they think better of themselves.
1	He has been my family doctor for over 15 years now, he has made me feel very at ease as a teeger and young woman and I felt like I could really trust him with all my issues. He is always very interested and patient and doesn't make it look like he has better things to move on to.
-1	I trust her because she never seems in a rush and always has time for my questions or concerns.  She does not just shove a drug at me and send me on my way.
-1	I trust them because I have to and I can read and do my own research when it's necessary to question them. But they work for large companies and i'm not always convinced they have MY best interest rather than the company or even their own intentions for a specific outcome.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I know that insurance plays into this. Some things just don't get approved so they have to tell me different stuff. Also their persol beliefs play in so I know they  may not be honest with me at times.
-1	I went to them and told them I believe I had something, they brushed me off and said I was fine. Four visits and hundreds of dollars later I was diagnosed with that very thing and then was given a treatment that did not work.
-1	They know a lot more about the medical field than me. They wen to medical school, studied and learned more things than I know. Its usually better to trust an experts opinion on things like this. 
-1	I trust the doctors because they have been in the field and schooling for a long period of time.  I do struggle with them telling me what is convenient for them and what is best for me. 
1	I have been going to him for a while and he is great.  He actually listens to you and you can tell he really cares
-1	i trust them, the reasons why are because of there positions 
1	He works in a small town and is well-known in the community. He has a high reputation to uphold. 
-1	I just started with a new doctor, and she is young and persoble. She listens intently, asks me about my choices, and offers a variety of possible treatment plans. I greatly appreciate that after my previous doctor, who was nice but more interested in pushing supplements she had a fincial interest in.
-1	Its not that I don't trust in what they're saying to me, I just have to realize that they may not always be right, and with a serious diagnosis I would definitly seek a second opinion and move from there
-1	My primary care physician waves off my chronic health concerns and pretending my chronic stomach issues are normal or not a cause for concern even though I see them as very serious and suffer because of them.
1	I have been going to the same doctor for years now in a great clinic my kids and wife go to as well.  We really like it there and it eels like a whole team of care rather then one doctor.  
1	She listens to me
1	I trust my primary care physician because she took the time to get to know me and listen to my concerns. She regularly asks questions about things we've discussed previously.
1	I trust doctors in general because I grew up around them, and saw that almost all of them were there to help people. I don't believe any of them would suggest a treatment for any other reason than it being the best thing for the patient at that time.
1	My newest doctor is very good.  He takes the time with me to sit in the office after my physical and address any concerns.  This is the first time I have had a doctor that takes enough time with me.  I really do trust him and he explains things to me thoroughly
-1	I trust my doctor because despite his hurried overall attitude he has done nothing but provide me with proper medical care and make the best choices for my health.
1	I trust them for the most part. I feel that he doesn't have all the expertise I need for my different conditions though.
1	I have a very good Doctor. I have no reason not to trust him. 
-1	I think that sometimes the doctor is not listening to my concerns and is just giving me text book or generic answers.
-1	My doctor has always been honest with me, even if it means telling me something I don't want to hear. She gives me a variety of treatment options when they are available, and that helps build trust. 
1	My doctor always spends a good amount of time talking to me when I go for a visit and answers all my questions thoroughly.
1	m\My primary care doctor has been seeing my family for many years. he always makes time to call and check in if one of us is very ill and makes us feel like he is doing his best to put our health first 
-1	I trust my doctor because she was someone my mom trusted. My mom had her for years and later recommended her to me. She was instrumental in referring my mom to a doctor who diagnosed her as BRCA1+. So we ended up trusting her. My mom has since passed from BRCA1+-related cancer, but this doctor even called her after my mom was termil, just to say hello and see how she was doing.
1	I have been going to my primary care physician for a long time now, so I understand his methods and we have a relationship. He knows my habits and health concerns, and he never hesitates to tell me the good and the bad. He let me see the reports and exam results so I can see for myself what is happening, and he'll answer any questions I have. 
-1	my doctor sees so many patients they usually diagnos you with what everyone else has. they only spend like 5 minutes with you.
1	I have been going to this Doctor since I was a young boy and he has taken amazingly good care of me and my family.  He is also a member of my church and we know his family.  He has fully earned my trust and respect.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP, but I do feel like she's a little old.  I think it's worth getting a second opinion when anything serious comes up. However, for general run of the mill problems, I think she's fine. 
-1	i distruct my primary care physcian because i see a different person each time. I never have someone who knows me. I'm always explaining things. It's like im a car and the mechanic is different each time.
-1	Everyone is different. Some are better than others.
-1	I have been to my doctor, been waiting in the waiting room and seen him talking to a friend. When my doctor notices that he has patient's waiting he gets angry and tells them they could look for other doctors.  I also don't trust him as he does not do thorough exams.  He simply refills my prescription every year without checking anything.
1	I trust my doctor because they went to school for years to study medicine. They have a wealth of knowledge behind them I could never grasp
1	I think they want to help people .That's what they went to school and training for. So, I trust that they know what they're doing and can make the best decisions.
1	I have been going to my PCP for over 10 years.  She is always happy to see me, and takes all the time that I need.  Every decision she makes has been the right one.  She has so much experience and makes me feel well cared for. 
-1	My primary is very knowledgeable and listens to what my concerns are, I feel very comfortable trusting him.
1	I trust my primary care doctor quite a bit.  She is upfront with me about things, and straightforward on her opinion of what I need to do. She also has been right so far about everything.
-1	I trust my physician.  They are licensed and educated
1	My doctor seems straightforward and trustworthy. I feel no reason to doubt him.
-1	I have been seeing my dr for a long time and she knows me pretty well.
1	I've had the same physician for years now. So,  he has gained my trust.
1	My doctor takes my concerns seriously. In fact, I had a problem with itching during my pregncy. The nurse line told me that it was in my head and to just deal with it. When I mentioned it to my doctor, she immediately ran tests and diagnosed me with a condition that required me to be induced right away, as it could have resulted in my baby being stillborn. The fact that she took my concerns seriously over something as small as itchy hands and feet shows she cares.
-1	I don't think I have seen my primary care physician enough to establish more trust.  I have only seen her once, so most of my answers are based off experiences that I have had with doctors in general, mostly OBs.
-1	I trust my PC because she listens to me and what I am trying to accomplish. She hears me and allows me to have a say in if I want to take medicine, approach things a certain way. She cares. 
1	She is laid back and doesn't get worked up about stuff that isn't important.  She let's me know to relax and not worry. 
1	My doctor is a straight-forward guy.  I believe that he tells me like it is.  I know that he's very good at his job.  I have confidence in him.
1	I have been going to my primary care doctor for many years so I have built trust in him. He encourages questions and is great at asking what I think because he says I know my body better than he ever could. His confidence in me and listening skills are what really make me trust him. 
-1	I trust my physician. He knows me well enough and has always acted in my best interest. He is always willing to listen to my concerns.
1	My doctors have always been the type of people to relay a sense of trust. Not only in their ability to explain what is happening to me, but in their demeanor.
-1	 I have wonderful doctors at always put my needs first if I have a question or problem they're happy to answer it or get me information to make a better choice 
-1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind. At the end of the day he will do whats best for me even if it causes him an inconvenience 
1	It features an open communication system. He listens. I listen. Discussions are thought-provoking. He is a valuable resource to not just myself, but my family.
1	I've never had her judge me and she's very thorough in explaining why she things this medicine or htis procedure should be done and won't do anything unless I absolutely understand what is going on.
1	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear not what I want to hear.
-1	I think that my doctor and doctors in general face a number of pressure outside of being an advocate for best outcomes for me. Furthermore I do not trust the expertise of only one person in any situation. This means that if I feel something is serious I look for a different opinions and research the issue myself. I also feel that doctors are often unwilling to address my concerns to satisfaction due to time constraints, so this makes me feel that I ought not to trust them compeletly. 
-1	My most recent primary care physician was very dismissive of my needs, did not inform me of the seriousness of my condition, and overall did not spend the requisite time with me to inform me of my condition. I am still living with the relevant condition as a result. 
-1	I trust them because obviously they must be doing something right to be in business
-1	My primary care physician has known me for majority of my life and is very thorough about what needs to be done about my medical needs.
-1	DOCTORS ARE LIKE GOD
-1	It's my life, it's not my doctor's life. It's his job. Even if he has every intention of doing the best by me, that doesn't mean he's capable or doing that does it. Doctor's don't know everything, and it's my body and health and I have to live with it.
1	He is good and addresses any issue or concern that I have. 
1	I've never had a reason to doubt a doctor when I've seen one. Every meeting I've had with a doctor has always gone well. The doctor has always given me a sense of confidence in their decisions.
-1	My doctor just seems to be in a rush to get from one patient to the next and doesn't spend much time with any one patient.
-1	I just switched to a new PCP after a move. I have a very pleasant visit with my new doctor and I felt he was honest, listened to my concerns and friendly. 
-1	"In general, I trust doctors. In the area where I live we have a good selection of doctors and health professiols to choose from so it is in their best interest to provide quality health care.  With the abundance of information available on the internet, people often use that information to get a ""second opinion"" of what doctors tell them as well."
1	My doctor seems very knowledgeable in his field. He takes time and doesn't rush. Not glued to his laptop. So far he has been right with any diagnosis.
-1	I think my doctors take the time to answer questions but also try to make sure I have the most options covered.
-1	Well, I just met my new doctor not too long ago, and I believe he's wrong on some points, but I don't believe it's out of trying to hide things from me.  I think he just believes every last thing that he was taught, and does not alter from that reality.
-1	I feel like doctors usually try to do what is best but sometimes they are really busy. Also, sometimes they might recommend a certain treatment because they might get a kickback from a drug company.
-1	I mostly trust my current health care provider, a nurse practitioner. She listens and took some of my recent experiences and behavior seriously. For example, I recently took someone else's pain pills because I was in serious pain. She saw that as a need for my pain to be addressed, not me overreacting.
-1	I normally distrust them. They love to hurry my along and don't seem like they're really listening to me. They just rather get me in-and-out quick to make fast money. I always leave there disappointed in them.
-1	I trust my doctor will listen and provide adequate care. However sometimes i feel like they need pushing in the right direction or motivation to provide the care. Sometimes I think it's easier for them to avoid a situation so they don't have to deal with it.
-1	I feel like my primary care physician and most in general just want to constantly put people on medication to fix everything. I don't want to be on a bunch of medication with negative side effects and that's all they try to push in order to fix problems. The lack of options causes my distrust in my doctor.
1	My PCP has been very open and honest about changes I've needed to make in my life to get and stay healthy. I never felt as though they were doing anything to persolly convenience herself, and I've trusted the advice given to me. 
-1	I dont disturst him, but I also dont completely trust him..  Dovtors do not know you from one visit to the next.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a persol friend and he was y friend before he became my doctor. He knows me very well.
1	Three generations of my family use my doctor as their primary care physician, and we all feel very comfortable with her. She has, on multiple occasions, found something of concern to her and sent us for testing which resulted in medical procedures needing to be performed. She prescribes medicine when we're sick, takes the time to fully explain what's going on, and responds quickly to emails/voicemails that we leave her.
1	I trust my doctor because when I come in asking about a condition or medication, she provides comprehensive guidance about why that might not be the best for me, as well as altertives. I feel that she's not just trying to placate me to get me out of the office or quickly move to her next patient. 
1	Because I have experience the medical field and I like his approach. I've had second opinions from colleagues on his diagnosis and treatment recommendations and they usually are consistent with what my colleagues suggest. 
-1	You choose to trust them based on if they deserve it.
-1	I have not found a regular doctor that I feel comfortable with.
-1	They have many years of training, and I do not. That's the long and short of it, really. I trust them.
-1	I trust my primary care, however sometimes I feel like she doesn't have all the information and that she's just trying her best. Sometimes I leave feeling confused. I feel like she is honest about all the different treatment options available, I just feel like she doesn't give the correct info because she doesn't know. 
-1	"I don't ask a whole lot of good questions, so I'm just like ""I guess you have the degree and experience, so whatever you say."" Maybe this is trusting enough but maybe this doesn't allow me the best control of my health."
-1	I do not like authority
-1	My doctors give me the facts. He or she does not sugarcoat my diagnosis. That makes me trust them.
1	I feel they know a lot more than I do and I can trust their opinions. They are not out to just make money but also to help people and part of being helpful is doing the right thing as far as diagnosis and subjestions on health.
1	I trust my PCP because he seems to care about my health.  He takes time to understand my questions and give me advise.
-1	I trust them because i know them and they know me well. I dont really have any distrust for him and overall i dont see why i would with anyone else.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a couple of years now. She takes the time to listen to my questions and makes sure I understand the answers. 
1	I get along very well with my doctor. I feel she genuinely cares about my well being, both physically and mentally. She is very sweet and kind.
1	My primary care physician has taken care of my family for years and is pretty trustworthy. She's also very open about how her decision process works. So I'm fairly confident in her.
-1	i think they only want to prescribe you medications and other things that make you feel better and come back for more
-1	"I have a new PCP so I don't totally trust her yet. She seemed to just gloss over any ""problems"" that I addressed with her during our first encounter. "
-1	"I think my doctor is very, ""typical"", in that they tell you what is on the paperwork with little regard as to your persol situation. While they are obviously competent, they are not exactly empathetic."
-1	He's always been a straight shooter. He gives me the information that I need and tells me what I need to do going forward.
-1	I would trust him. Unless your instincts say otherwise
-1	i don't usually trust doctors because they just make me feel uncomfortable. sometimes i feel like they don't listen to me at all. i also oftentimes feel like i am being judged by them. 
-1	I don't always feel they are devoting enough time and attention to my problems. Initial courses of treatment don't always work, then they ask more questions. They jump to easy conclusions.
-1	PCPs can be shadowed by other influences such as medical companies to push their products for kickbacks.  This is not true for every PCP but it is known.
-1	I've had persistent neck pain for the last decade and was prescribed all sorts of treatment ranging from medication to injections. After basically giving up I found a simple over-the-counter medication that worked and had never been recommended.
1	He listenes and talks with you about things, always explains well.
-1	I trust her to do what is right for me but I'm not afraid to ask for a second opinion if I need to (thankfully I've never had to do that). She hasn't let me down yet so I have trust in her. 
1	I generally trust physicians. They have a lot of education and training by ture of the profession. Also, a doctor isn't likely to give poor care for too long, because it would likely be noticed. Doctors have a responsibility to be trustworthy, and I think that's the general cultural expectation.
1	I trust my doctor because of the wonderful service that she provides me with. She always answers my questions and provides feedback for me regarding my questions.
-1	In regards to doctors I feel like they can be trusted for the most part. They have a lot riding on being perfect in their profession. They can lose their jobs and whole practices if they don't perform. I think they can mainly be trusted because of this.
-1	typically it is best to trust your instincts. if the doc seems good trust him
1	For the most part I think I trust my doctor. She always takes her time and really listens to what I have to say before making any sort of rash decision. If I have any questions she's more than willing to answer and we talk what would be best for me. She's very kind and I find it easy to discuss things with her. Overall I think  I trust her decisions and think that she has my best interests at heart.
1	She always gives it to me straight and never tells me any bull. She tells me what she thinks is wrong and tries to help me understand what is going on with my body. 
1	MY primary care physician is always thorough with me and gives me good advice in regards to my treatment. I have always gotten better by doing what he says so I have a lot of faith in his judgements
-1	Doctors are just like everyone else. Some you can trust, and others you cannot.
-1	I feel like I listen to what they say but then wait to form my own opinion on it. I haven't always had doctors give me accurate diagnoses. Sometimes I have to do my own research and tell them what I have before they can tell me themselves.
1	I've been going to the same primary care physician for about 20 years. He knows my medical history and has given me sound advice during that time. It is a relationship built on trust.
1	They have not let me down. They have a lot of experience and they know what is best.
1	I feel that doctors are for the most part trustworthy. But in general some are in a big hurry to get to the next patient. They sometimes make it seem like  are putting them out to ask many questions. Like you are wasting their time.
-1	My insurance recently changed, so I go to a local clinic and never see the same doctor more than once, so I never have a chance at building trust or a relationship with them. Usually, where I go, appointments are only a few moments, regardless of the severity of the reason you go, so I find it hard to believe they're really devoting enough time and energy to treating me in the best possible way.
1	I just started seeing a new doctor so I suppose I don't know enough to completely trust her yet, but she's already much better than my previous doctor. She's very friendly and treats me more like an equal than like a patient she has authority over. She's easy to talk to and joke around with, and seems like she wants what's best for me even if she has to go out of her way to do it.
-1	My primary care physician has dismissed my worries and problems before. She misdiagnosed one of my family members and that family member ended up in the hospital because of it.
1	I have no reason not to trust my primary physician . He has always seemed concerned and knowledgeable, always making sure my needs have been taken care of.  
-1	I feel that doctors now a days are under so much pressure to see so many patients that things are rushed and missed.  
1	I trust my primary care physician. I've known my doctor for years and haven't had a bad experience dealing with the doctor or doctor's office in general. The information I've been given thus far has been correct and helpful. Therefore, until I have a bad experience, my trust is secure.
1	I trust that my doctor gives me the best options for my care, and that he considers what I might need or already be taking before prescribing anything.  I do realize that sometimes mistakes can be made, but I feel that he will try and minimize these mistakes.
-1	I honestly don't trust anyone. I believe what they say is helpful but holistic approaches are good too. 
-1	It really depends on the situation, some doctors I feel like they don't have enough time to talk about a medical condition or they seem like they're too busy to really go into any type of detail. But I do have a doctor I normally see that does take the time out to explain what he thinks the root of a problem may be.
-1	He doesn't spend much time with me and it seems like he is just trying to get me out of the door as fast as he can.
-1	Overall, I trust my doctor to give me honest answers to my questions. I can't prove they are 100% accurate, however, I have never had an issue with her diagnosis. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to ask my opinion on which way I would prefer to go for certain treatments of issues I've had. She will give me information and her opinion and statistics but she ultimately will let me decide which route I would prefer to take.
-1	"I really hate how ""trust"" is even a factor. It bothers me that when I'm given information, it sounds a lot like a factual answer when in fact it is an opinion. I've met young doctors who are bright, older doctors who are dim, and vice versa, so it's difficult to gauge the competency of who I'm speaking to. And really, the only way to tell if someone is right or wrong is if I know the answer already, which I almost never do. "
-1	I don't trust many doctors because alot prove to be more after money than helping the patients
-1	My primary care doctor knows both of my parents and is a very blunt person in general. I do not shirk from getting the information I want so I am not scared too ask questions.
-1	I trust my doctor because they are more knowledgeable than I am but I do not give them complete trust until I read and understand the options myself and am able to agree or disagree with them. 
1	I have a relatively good experience with the doctors I've visited. I made sure to ask close family and friends about certain doctors they visited and which ones to avoid. I was able to draw conclusions from there.
-1	I trust him because he is just doing his job. He has no reason to hide treatment options unless he honestly doesn't think they are worth mentioning.
1	My physicians seems to want me to stay healthy. They give good and reasoble advice.
-1	"I distrust any doctor because I have had bad experiences with them in the past.  Ultimately I believe they are interesting in making money and nothing else.  Most of the time they seem bothered by your problems and do not listen to what I have to say.  I've been told before to take antidepressants for a pain in my stomach, which turned out to be a cyst on my ovary.  It took FIVE doctors to get a diagnosis that wasn't ""you're crazy."""
1	They seem trustworthy.  It is the insurance company I do not trust.
-1	I distrust physicians because the way the medical system is set up isn't about quality of care. The way the medical system is set up is to push as many patients through as quickly as possible. Once we start incentivizing quality care; then my trust in physicians will rise.
1	I actually just met my PCP, but she came in having clearly read my file. She took a lot of time with me, didn't appear rushed at all. She had a good bed side manner. She gave appropriate recommendations and explained things well.
-1	It depends on the situation.  If the doctor is trying to push a new drug that is quite expensive then I would wonder if he is getting something out of the deal.  If I were to think that he may be wrong on a diagnosis then I would likely look for another opinion.  At the end of the day the doctor is a human and no human is perfect, so unless they give a reason to not believe them then I probably would lean towards trusting them unless I felt they were wrong in some way.  
-1	I barely trust mainstream doctors at all. A lot of their diagnoses are just guesses, but they act as if they KNOW what they're talking about and the patient doesn't. I use doctors mainly when I want a particular test done or think I need a prescription.
1	Dr. Dixon is comforting for the most part and I have been a patient of hers for a long time so that helps me trust her. But sometimes I get confused.
-1	He's been honest but one doctor is not an end-all game when it comes to my health, I should consult multiple doctors if a problem arises. Therefore, I don't have full unwavering trust in one doctor.
1	He's always been there for us and has had good results in treatment. He hears me and has addressed my needs. So far he has been good at curing us.
1	I've had the same doctor since I was a kid and in fact, he is my family's doctor. So my mother and even grandmother have a great deal of experience with him. He's willing to talk, answer questions and usually does well. Plus he hasn't killed any of us yet, so that's a great bonus.
-1	I feel as if there is too much for a physician to gain by their own self interests, they have medications that they feel are important to push on people with the side effects and all that considered they often over look the most simplistic things like change of nutrition, or even considering the factors of the patients life.
-1	i really have no choice but to put my trust into my doctor sometimes, because health is theyre field. 
-1	I have great trust in my current position because I have seen my physician long enough that I trust what she will say and I trust that she understands what treatment is necessary. At this point I have established A rapport to give her complete trust. 
1	I always make sure to choose a physician I am comfortable with. This means that I feel they have my best interest in mind and are not just out to milk my insurance or have little interest in their patients.
1	He seems to have a good understanding of what goes on. He lets me know whatis likely and will order a test if I'm worried even if it's unlikely. Seems nice and caring
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been in practice for a long time.  He is extremely experienced.
-1	Although I don't doubt that my primary care physician cares about me, I also believe that they are not my best friend. I try my best to listen to what they tell me but I also research the information I'm given on my own and find out what the best course of action is.
1	I trust him because he's never given me a reason not to. Every time I've gone to him he gives me the correct medication or suggestions to alleviate what's going on and they've worked every time
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my doctor for 24 years.
-1	As with most things/people, a medical professiol can have an agenda they are pushing and most of the time it's for monetary reasons. I don't believe in taking unneccessary medicine and sometimes I don't trust the dr when they tell me I need to take a medicine when I think there is a better treatment option available.
-1	Well, on the one hand, I trust my doctor because he is a trained professiol and I assume is there because he wants to help people as most doctors probably do.  On the other hand, medicine today is still very much a business.  Money.  And as we all know, when money is involved, there is an inherent conflict of interest at times and we must find very moral doctors who will rise above this conflict and do what is right.  Not all do.
-1	I do trust our physician, but feel that we are often hurried in and out of his office. It would be nice if they got to know us a little more and asked more questions. 
-1	I haven't had a major sickness that would require me to seek out a new PCP so I've stayed with the one I've had since I was a teeger.  
1	I trust doctors because i believe that they have my best interests at heart
-1	My doctor is pretty conventiol and doesn't explore any new avenues of thinking. Sometimes I have to offer him ideas on what might help me.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for quite a few years now. She knows me well, and I trust that she will do what is best for my health. She is also available to talk to outside of office hours which is really great.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has been seeing people in my family for over 40 years. Most of my immediate family go to the same doctor and he is very persoble and a straight shooter. He does not beat around the bush when he needs to tell you something.
1	I have had the same primary care physician for over twenty years. He has shown that he intends nothing but the best over the years. I've been able to see his professiolism and he even keeps extra tabs on me to see if I am doing well.
-1	I feel they have a lot of knowledge and this is their expertise.  I also feel like my doctor tries to get to know me. 
1	For the most part I trust my doctor (who is actually a PA).  I can see in his eyes and actions that he really is reading my material and really does want to help.  It is my responsibility to make sure anything he says applies to me but for the most part I go along with what he says because of the time and care he puts into his words.
-1	This is more about the doctor I see most often which is my gastroenterologist, he always seems to be pushing me to non-generic drugs even though I like the way my body reacts to what I am currently taking.  I also feel he pushed me into an endoscopy I did not at all need, just to get another year supply of a drug I depend on.  All in all that cost me $2500 out of pocket that I couldn't afford at the time. 
1	I've known my doctor for 25 years and I see us more as friends than a doctor-patient relationship.
-1	I've been seeing my PCP mostly for anxiety issues and so because we've talked about the reasons why the anxiety might be happening, she was very understanding and informative.
-1	For the most part, I trust in doctors, but I've run into situations where they are giving the minimal amount of treatment so they can be done with me and move on to the next patient.
-1	I trust her for the most part except when I had my first kid she didn't figure out ahead of time that my baby was breech so I ended up having an unexpected C-section. 
-1	She is there for me when I need her. She does not rush through appointments with me. She explains everything and makes sure that I understand. She is knowledgeable about current trends in health care.
1	I have been with the same doctor for 11 years and he has never given me any reason to not trust him - he is very thorough and concise in his diagnoses and gives me the best overall advice and information that I could ever hope for with any doctor. 
-1	In my experience they just want you in and out so they can make their quick money. I had gall bladder pains for a year, and they kept telling me I was just constipated. I filly got someone that did an ultrasound and I had to have immediate surgery, and I was jaundiced. A YEAR of incompetence! 
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, and the care I get from her is always excellent. I am able to ask questions and get answers when I need to and she is never rushed or indifferent to my needs.
1	I've had my PCP for a while and he is probably the most down to earth doctor that I've come across. Always explains things throughly, always gives options.
-1	My doctor just seems so busy. It's hard to tell if he really pays attention to me and my health because I am only seen for a few minutes. 
1	Very caring doctor. She is non-judgemental.
-1	I distrust doctors because they work for big companies and the companies are in it to make money therefore the doctors have to find a way to make that money.
1	She has always been very thorough in her explations and care. She has also always made my options very clear to me.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  But I know that we are all human and humans make mistakes.
1	i have had him for 11 years and never once has he not taken my questions or worries with seriousness.
1	Well I think you have to trust that your doctor knows more than you do and is trying to do what is best for you. My doctor always explains all of my options and makes recommendations but still asks for my input as well. I trust he wants to do what is best for me.
-1	I hate doctors.  I feel bad saying that but I find them to be judgy and hypocritical.  Doctors seem to think they know more than they actually do and that can be very problematic...
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been doing this a long time. Also, he went to medical school, not me!
-1	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable about the field of medicine than I am, so I listen to them.
1	I feel based on the information in front of them they make the best decision possible.  I think if they do not know they are at least diligent about sending you onto a specialist, or double checking things like lab work, etc. to rule things out and make sure nothing serious is going on.
1	My doctor has been my doctor for over ten years. He is never rushed and always takes time to answer my questions and concerns.  I like that he values my input and will look up things that I tell him about.  He seems genuinely concerned about my care.  He is easy to talk to.
-1	Doctors are influenced by the number they can put on your bill.  If it costs more they'll recommend it.  Also pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to push their drugs over something that may be more appropriate for my condition.
-1	they have a duty to do their job at least competently, but i don't know my PCP very well so I can't really make a persol judgment, my doctor seems pretty busy and rushes me a lot
1	Most of the doctors I have been in contact with recently seemed to have my best care in mind. I recently hurt my shoulder and needed to go to the Orthopedic Surgeon for car. While I had not been to this Ortho before, he was very thorough and explained the cost/benefits of the treatment plan he had set for me. However, I find that interacting with other medical staff, such as psychiatrists, RNs, LPNs, that they are much more business-oriented, in and out. For those types of specialists/general staff I do not have as much trust as I do my PCP or Ortho.
1	I trust the doctor and I rely on their education and experience.
1	I trust my doctor because he has yet to give me any false or misleading information. He spends time talking to me and doesn't rush me out of the door. Listens to my concerns/questions and answers them well
1	He is very open to answering my questions and spending time explaining things. 
1	I trust my doctor as I have been seeing her for many years now.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is a family friend and has been looking after us for most of my life.
-1	I trust them somewhat. They do want the best for their patients. They are also in the pockets of medical industry. They at there to make money too. They may not have the best information and think they are experts because of their education. 
-1	I trust my doctor. However, I recognize that she is very busy, probably over-worked, and cannot take the time she, herself, would like to devote to her patients. It is not her fault how quickly she has to work and I know that she does the best job she can do given the situation. 
-1	I have gotten a new primary care physician in the past year and she has been more thorough and careful than any doctor I've had previously.  My past PCP rushed through appointments and gave me prescriptions without much concern.  My new PCP is careful to suggest medications and tries to find if altertive therapies may work better and to ensure that I am really getting something I need.  
1	She goes out of her way to make sure I feel comfortable and to see if anything else is wrong. She tells me things about herself if she has similar problems to make me feel better about my issues. 
-1	She seems like a good doctor. I don't have any complaints. If she thought something was wrong I'm sure she'd tell me.
-1	I trust that they will tell me what they think. However, I'm not always convinced that they're up to date on the very latest options. I also think they sometimes omit borderline information (i.e., risks or treatments that are on the extreme ends of the normal bell curve) just out of the sake of time. I generally trust them, as far as it goes, though.
1	My doctor makes sure to spend an adequate amount of time with me to ensure i can have all the questions i have answered. They don't rush me and even if they feel a test doesn't need to be done, they will do it anyways just to make sure.
-1	I do not think that he like women or respects them as much as men. I feel like he talks to my husband with respect and caring but dismisses me when I try to tell him my mental health issues.
-1	I do trust that doctors are not in it to just make the money, but to provide good health care. They will be honest it what they think is the best treatment for you. However, I know doctor's cannot go into detail about the possible long term effects of a treatment so I always like to do my own research. Particularly reading forums and such.
1	The Physician's Assistant that I see (I normally do not see the actual doctor) is very pleasant and seems caring. She does not seem rushed or like she is trying to hurry through the appointment. She also gives me the opportunity to ask questions about any diagnosis or treatment.
-1	My doctor is very candid. She always lets me know the possible effects and she has no problem telling me what she thinks. However, she just rushes too much and seems like she has better things to be doing.
-1	I think that their reputation are on the line so they are generally honest.  There are people who expect miracles from doctors so sometimes the doctor has to answer the best he can but needs to move on to the next patient so he may be a bit short with answers. 
-1	I have seen my primary care doctor for almost thirty years and have complete faith in him for my medical health. He know me extremely well and is well regarded in the community for his thorough manner.
1	I trust my doctor because I have never been led astray. I have never had a negative experience with my doctor. I have no reason to doubt my doctor's competence or motives and have had good outcomes.
-1	He is usually in a hurry when I go to see him. I imagine that is because he sees so many patients. Since I see him rarely, I imagine there isn't enough of a connection for him to really care outside a professiol capacity.
-1	There have been times where my doctor has been wrong. But I do have two specialists that often go the extra mile for me and I feel I can trust. 
-1	I think they just come up with explations to get you out faster
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He always goes above and beyond to make sure my needs are met and keeps me up to date regarding my health.
1	I have never had a medical issue where I didn't know what was wrong before going in to see him. I usually show up for an appt and explain what's going on and know exactly how he's going to treat me.
1	Always takes the time to explain things in detail and answer questions, never rushes me and believes in finding the cause and not just treating the symptom
-1	I have been seeing this doctor for some time for a serious illness. So far they have maged it quite well so I trust their judgement
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been able to help me. I have been going to the same doctor since I was a teeger.
1	My doctor explains most things clearly to me. He genuinely shows he cares and checks up on me outside of the office. Quick to answer my concerns as well.
-1	I feel doctors truly care for their patients and want the best for them.
-1	I think they are too much influenced by money, corruption and big pharma. 
1	I've been going to the same doctor for years. He is very kind and shows that he actually cares about my wellbeing. He is never in a hurry and explains everything to me in a way that I can understand.
-1	Because I feel like they should know what is best for you and if they explain all the options and consequences then they are more trustworthy.
-1	I don't trust him because a few years ago he prescribed medication for high blood pressure that almost killed me. The side-affects were so bad I had to go into the er room.
-1	I trust the GYN I have, she takes her time and sits to answer my questions and chat. I never feel rushed or neglected by her. I have been to doctors in the past though that spend minimal time with you and it doesn't feel like they actually care about you.
1	My doctor tells me all of the options I have, even if they don't benefit him.
-1	I distrust my doctor because I go to the VA for my healthcare and they really don't seem to hire or keep the best of medical providers there. They are always in a rush and don't seem to really care to give the time of day to your problems they are all very low quality providers. So, that is why I do not trust my physician. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician for the most part, I have only meet her once. I am still working on putting my complete trust in her. I completely trusted my previous doctor since I had been with her for many years. Switching made me uneasy. But I trust in her and her education. 
1	I've been seeing the same doctor for a long time. He knows by medical history very well. He's a very friendly man who doesn't rush through appointments, and really does listen to my concerns. I've grown to trust him very much and feel he makes good decisions for my health.
-1	Honestly, I trust doctors to a certain extent as far as diagnosing a problem, but I think their treatment options are generally given according to what makes them the most money. 
-1	I trust my physician because he has always been right about what treatments I need over the years, and he has been my doctor for a long time. Since he has never been wrong, I feel that I can trust him. 
-1	My doctor seems to care about me when I visit. She does not contact me often, but when I need help she is helpful.
-1	They try to rush during a visit and get to the next patient as soon as possible.
-1	it is neutural, because sometimes where I am from they just want a quick fix  and try to just take care of the issue as quick as they can
-1	No one should completely trust a doctor. He has an invested reason to tell you all these things that you can do without. His pockets get bigger when he gets you to do more things that are not needed. 
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician. My last one, who I'd see once a year for a basic check-in and a prescription refill for my anti-anxiety med, told me last year not to come back anymore because I'm uninsured (stuck in a state-caused ACA loophole) and can't afford more in-depth exams. Being told something like that kind of dented my trust in medical professiols in general.
1	I've been going to him for quite some time now. We've developed a good relationship. He's frank and honest and that's exactly what I expect.
-1	
-1	There is no real motivation for a doctor not to do what is best for you. He or she will get paid the same regardless of the outcome of your medical situation so there is no reason for the doctor to screw you over. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has always been super honest and up front with me. He has always taken the time to explain everything that needs to be explained and he has never hidden anything from me when it comes to my medical conditions or illnesses. 
-1	My doctor seems genuine and intelligent. She generally provides me with a range of options before prescribing a particular one. She seems heartfelt and concerned, and takes time to talk with me.
-1	I trust him because he has been right on his diagnosis so far.
-1	I feel she is very thorough.  She has done more tests on me then previous doctors, and usually has answers for me on any questions I have.
1	Recently finished medical training.  Listens.
-1	I am not completely happy with my current physician. He tends to rush patients in and out of the office, spending very little time. I always feel rushed and try to obtain the most important information first. I feel like my physician always looks for the quick and easy answer instead of spending time looking into something more seriously.
1	I trust my doctor since i feel like they are just looking for what is best for me
-1	Their willingness to explain my medical diagnosis thoroughly, but in understanding terms makes me trust my pcp. 
1	My doctor has been working in the field for a long time, so I trust her. I can also tell from her tone of voice that she really cares about the welfare of her patients, so I can trust her 100%. 
-1	Is open to talking with me, never makes me feel rushed.  Listens to my concerns about potential treatments.  Keeps a level head, and is persoble...not a robot.
1	My PCP doctor has been treating me for more than 20 years now.  He also is part of a very small practice that is in the country side.  Even though I live farther away from his practice now, I still commute to see him because I trust him based on our long history and the experiences I have had with him in the past.  He tends to be very honest with me with regards to everything that we talk about. 
-1	I have trust in his ability as a doctor and his medical doctor, but he is a very busy doctor in a poor neighborhood, so it can be hard to keep his attention on something that doesn't seem very bad from an outside perspective. 
1	My doctor has never given me reason for distrust. He is always knowledgeable, friendly and professiol.
-1	I don't have a PCP, but do feel that most doctors are looking out for their patients' best interests and can be trusted.
-1	i feel that i just depends on how you feel in the moment with the doctor. 
1	i trust my physical because if there is any problem at any time of the day, i know she will be there for me. 
1	My doctor is very paiteint with me and other paitients. She takes the time to explain things and answers all questions I have. I never feel that I am inconveniencing her when I visit with a problem.
-1	I think doctors are always pushing big pharma agendas of the latest most expensive drugs in return for kickbacks.
1	I find that my pcp takes her time when examining and listens to what I am saying. She is stern about certain things but does not push unnecessary treatments or procedures. 
-1	I know that doctors aren't perfect, but they go through one of the most rigorous schooling systems of any profession. If they don't know the answer then nobody does.
-1	I have a terrible list of back problems and the doctor is afraid to give me anything stronger because of all of the opiod addiction in the country, even though I've never done anything wrong. so he keeps giving me expensive medicines that don't work and wont listen to me when i talk to him. he seems in a hurry to get me out of the office.  
-1	It's always wise to get a second opinion or look for more information. Doctors are not perfect and cannot know every single bit of medical information in the world. There may be newer treatments or updated diagnoses. Also, some doctors are kind of in bed with the pharmaceutical industry and might recommend a drug just to increase sales. This is not necessarily common, but not unheard of either.
1	I trust her because she has always told me the exactly how she felt about any situation. She answers all questions the way she sees fit and now just because it would be what I want to hear. She is straight forward with anything she tells me. She also has never told me wrong and has helped me a lot.
-1	I trust they'll do just enough to keep me alive long enough to bleed my pockets
-1	I've been seeing him for several years now, and have always followed his recommendations, which have been very useful. I expect this relationship to continue going forward. 
-1	I have great trust in doctors because it takes a lot to become one. Lots of school lots of practice and lots of experience make for great helpers.
-1	I usually choose a primary care physician with lots of experience. I based my trust off of his experience and user review online.
-1	because my doctor has been inconsistent in his actions and negligent in his recommendations 
-1	usually he gives me good advice.But sometimes they put you on meds with to many's side effects.
1	In the above I was talking about my OBGYN. I have to see him often for complications and cancer screenings. He is always straight forward with me, and has actually saved my life twice. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has never  done anything that has made me question his ability of motives. Everything that is done or tested for me has a specific reason that he explains to me. 
1	Ive been seeing this doctor for a long time and she actually happens to be a relative through marriage many many years ago so i have no reason to believe she would be completely honest so i am the same with her
-1	I completely trust this doctor because two years ago I had a knot in my neck, and right away I went to see my Primary Care Doctor. After examining the knot, and telling him my other symptoms, he did not beat around the bush, he sent me directly to a specialist who then biopsied the knot, and it turned out to be cancer. This doctor does not waste my time or his, and cares deeply about his patients.
-1	Doctors seem very disinterested and distant. They don't seem to fully take my complaints into account and they always seem in a rush to get me out as fast as possible. I hate being treated that way. 
-1	I believe that the doctor does know better than me about medical treatment. However, I also know that there are incentives in providing certain options over others, and cultural biases that pervade the doctors perceptions (as well as my own).
-1	I am not smart enough to not trust my doctor completely. I don't go to the doctor that often, but when I do I take them at face value. They have never steered me wrong when I have needed them in the past.
1	They have gone to school to learn what they are doing and I have been going to them for a while and learned to trust what they have to say.  I have a good comfort level with them, and if you can't trust your doctor, you should change them.
1	I trust my physician because I have been working with him for a long time now. I almost see him as a friend. I can get persol with him and not have to worry because I trust him. In addition, he is very soft spoken and experienced. Overall, I would rate my doctor a 4/5.
1	My doctor takes her time to listen to my concerns and is not in a rush to get me out the door.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to what I have to say and thoroughly explains whatever I do not understand. I trust his opinion and I feel like he cares about me as a patient.
-1	i mostly trust my doctors but I need to double check through independent research to have full confidence
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. Though, he is a person just like others with flaws.
-1	I have had experiences with Workers Comps doctors who only care about workers comp and not my well being.
1	I've had her for 2 years and she'll always take the time to explain things to me and seems genuinely concerned. Since I'm on medicare not all doctors seem to think I'm not worth their time. That hasn't happened too much though. 
-1	i am aware of how they push medications that are provided them by certain pharmeceutical companies.  i also have witnessed first hand a doctor going to his office after assessing patient, and consulting with an encyclopedia to see what the patient has.  I think doctors are smart, but sometimes I think we give them too much credit.  They have to remember a ton of shit.
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because they take the take and answer all my questions. They let me know what I'm doing wrong about anything and lead me in the right path about my health. 
1	I trust my physician because he has always been good to me and given me accuracy and professiolism.
1	My doctor listens to me. She tells me te tests I should get and talks about my weight.
-1	Although doctors have to function in quick way due to overwhelming amounts of daily patients, it is unlikely that they have any bad intentions in mind. In my persol experience my doctor has always been honest and upfront with treatments and diagnosis.
-1	It's not that I think he's intentiolly deceiving me for some insidious purpose. I'm just read and heard about doctors getting bonuses for the amount of patients they can get on certain drugs (they get kick backs) weather this is true or not, we shouldn't ever just blindly follow someone because they went to school for awhile. Would if the school was corrupt? Would if Big Pharma changes the medical doc-turn so that the doctors believe its right, but it's actually wrong. 
-1	I trust them for the most part. I haven't had any issues where they were wrong. Most of my experiences with doctors have resulted in proper solutions for why I was there.
1	There's no reason for me not to trust my doctor. I haven't had any ill experiences, and she always seems willing to answer any questions that I may have in regards to procedures or medications.
-1	I feel like a doctor's office is a business like any other.  They are looking to help people but with a way that will also maximize their profits.
1	I've been seeing them for most of my life since I was a young child.  I believe they've always treated me with their best interest and care.
-1	I am not sure about those decisions since I only go to my doctor for annual check these years
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she as highly rated in my state, she has cared for 5 other of my family members, knows my entire medical family history better than I do, and she is very comforting and kind. She always explains everything I need to know, is very thorough and makes me feel comfortable with asking any questions.
1	I trust my doctor, but not completely. I do not, as a rule, trust Doctors in general. They all seem to start out good people, but most of them become greedy, and want to fix everything with pills. There is more to fixing someone than just pills.There is a job to do, most Doctors are not doing it properly.
1	I feel those called to such a high involvement with the human condition deserve our respect and ultimately admiration. The rigors of their study and training predispose them to being credible.
1	My doctors have saved my life, and I believe that they do an outstanding job.
-1	I trust my Doctor because i feel that he geunuinely cares about serving me properly, and has my best interests in mind. He has told me that he wanted to be a psychologist after he finished his Medical Degree, but it is too late now.
1	I have been seeing my PCP for many years. Since I am in good health, we rarely have issues requiring lots of medical direction or intervention. However, in the conversations we have had, I trust his judgment and expertise. He has always been straightforward with me about illnesses and treatment.
1	I tend to trust my Dr and their opinions because I have disclosed all the symptoms that I have been experiencing therefor I believe they can accurately provide me with a diagnosis.  I also believe that my Dr is also looking out for my best interest.
1	I trust him because he seems to know what he's doing. So far he's been right.So I trust him.
-1	In some ways I feel they push drugs on you because they get a cut of it.  Some doctors just rush though with you and move onto the next patient for money.  
1	 I trust my doctor as he has never steered me wrong.  I have no reason to believe that he would or that he would be not being honest with me.
-1	My dr. explains my options and asks me which I want to do. She will offer her opinion on what she thinks is the best option for me but ultimately it is my decision. However, she and I disagree on the usefulness of supplements. I think it's helpful to take the ones that I do and she disagrees. I don't completely trust her because of this.
-1	my dr is easy going but very honest. he tell you what you need to do to get better . he doesn't seem snobby like some drs.
1	I have always been completely satisfied with my Doctor. Always thorough gives me the goods and the bads and tells me it straight forward not holding back 
1	They have gone above and beyond to check in with me after appointments and procedures. They seem genuinely concerned about any issues I am having. I feel like the believe me when I have pain and are not dismissive of any condition. 
-1	My primary care physician is very kind and listens to my problems, so I have high confidence and trust in him.
-1	I have been seeing my Pcp my entire life. He has always been honest and helpful. I have gained a lot of trust over the years
1	My primary care physician is very nice woman. She knows a lot, always friendly, and ready to give me any explation I need.
-1	I have a new primary care doctor, but she is kind and well-respected. I trust her based on others' experiences and honest reviews, in addition to persol experience. 
1	I do trust my primary care physician because they are a person who I've been seeing for several years now, and whenever any health problems arise, the solutions provided by said physician are very effective in solving these problems.
-1	my old doctor was wonderful he explained everything in a way someone could understand and he was nice and cared.  He got a new job with the government and now I go to his partner he had at the practice.  The new doctor (old doctors partner) doesn't care...he just wants to get you in and out of there fast.
1	I do not go to the doctor often, and when I do, it's usually a different doctor, so I don't really build trust. That being said, I've had largely very positive experiences with my doctors-- especially psychiatrists. They seem to have my best interests at heart.
1	I trust my doctor to evaluate me and to be honest with me. He is very good at referring me to other good doctors and I trust him to do this.
-1	I do trust my doctor, she seems very informed, and she never takes a guess unless she is sure. I appreciate how organized and detail-oriented she is. My reservations mostly come from my hesitation to fully trust in another person. While medicine has been revolutionized, it is still not an exact science, and things can go wrong at any moment, so while I do trust my doctor, I am not sure I would ever 100% accept everything they told me without some reservations about their correct diagnosis. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years.  If it were a new doctor I might be a little more hesitant in my trust of them especially if I may not agree with their thoughts or approach.
1	She has been my doctor for the last 11 years, and as soon as I met her I trusted her.  She was warm and caring and took time to listen to me.  She is extremely thorough and such a great doctor. 
-1	My doctor always seems like he's in a rush and doesn't seem like he is always concerned about answering all my questions. I think he is more concerned about getting done with each patient quickly. 
-1	My doctor seems in a hurry. I think my doctor does not care for me because I refuse treatments for things like the Flu shot. He seems in a rush to get to the next patient. He says things that are contradictory and confusing to me without leaving time for me to follow up on what he said.
-1	You can't always believe everything the doctor says in terms of options sometimes they are just looking for the money
1	I have had the same doctor that my dad has been using.  She has been our family doctor for 20 years, and really helped a lot in some trying times.  She is simply the best.
-1	I don't think I receive adequate care, attention, or consideration.  I often feel hurried along and my doctor doesn't explain things in much detail, so I'm really under the impression that my doctor just sees each patient as something to cross off a to-do list.
-1	I had a 3 month cough, I was told it would get better on its own.
-1	My doctor is always pleasant and seems to be treating me fairly. We have not had any issues. I came from a primary care doctor that I did not have any trust for, so this seems like a huge improvement to me. 
-1	I go to a primary care physician at a school health center and I think that he is on a tight schedule, and has a lot of patients each day that limits his time to spend diagnosing my problems. 
1	I have been seeing my doctor for a couple of years and she is thorough and trusting.  She is always ready to listen to my concerns.  She addresses preventative medicine with a passion.
1	I mostly trust my doctor, however, I will never 100% rely on their word or advice without looking into myself or seeking other opinions.
1	I have had the same doctor for a long time and we have come to know each other. I feel she has an exceptiol persolity as well as the skills and knowledge to care for my body.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not judge me when I bring health issues to him. He is always very thorough in suggesting treatments. He does a good job explaining WHY I am having the symptoms  I am. 
1	My doctor is new to the family due to the fact the old doctor had to retire. So far from meeting him, he's great. He seems to really want to help and make sure you are taken care of.
1	I recently changed physicians to a female doctor and feel that she understands me better than the male doctor. I feel I can trust what she says and like her communication style. 
-1	I would hope they was tell me the truth about everything 
-1	I trust doctors because I know that they care for me. I know that they only want the best for me.
-1	I trust doctors like I trust policemen: i was brought up to trust them
1	I am able to easily talk to my doctor about issues I may have. She is very thorough and takes the time to answers my questions in a way I understand. I appreciate this.
-1	Sometimes he seems rushed and he might get benefits from recommending certain treatment to me, so I try to assess things objectively.
-1	I feel like doctors get commission for prescriptions that vendors tell them to sell, like hey sell 10 of these and we'll give you 1k, so all these doctors all they do is prescribe shit 
-1	I think in many occassions this is a result of a bad system. I have yet to see a real benefit for a physician to make me healthy. In most cases the physician is looking to see me, diagnose me, treat me, and get me out the door in a short window. With this model there is very little time to have a real conversation about me and my overall health.  
-1	The doctor that I have seen does not have a lot of time to see me and does not (because she cannot) remember information about me. She relies on her notes, which I don't find accurate to the information I give her, even when I have corrected her. For example, she had written down that I started birth control a month later than I had. She also changes her mind about my treatment very often and doesn't seem sure about what's necessary or helpful to me.
1	I like my doctor. He is very intelligent and I have been going to him for years. 
-1	I trust that the Dr believes he is being thorough. The PCP gives basic care and refers you to specialists who I believe try to help.  I don't trust any Dr.  I have been to so many for a chronic condition that I don't have total faith in any of them.
1	He listens very well and addresses all my concerns. He knows me and what I'm like, so he can tell when something is wrong. He really cares about his patients and takes the time to listen.
-1	I just started with a new PCP and have only seen him once, but I didn't like him and probably won't go back. He was dismissive of all of my health concerns. I've been taking blood pressure meds for years and going off of one blood pressure reading he declared that I didn't need them anymore. I was complaining of aneurysm-like pain in an extremely small spot of my head and he ignored that completely.
-1	I have been to my primary care physician twice in two years. The first time they refused to give me the full battery of STD tests I wanted. I had no reason to believe I contracted anything, but because I am non-monogamous I wanted to be responsible, and because I have a phobia of needles and needed a blood draw I figured I'd get all the blood drawing out of the way at once. I had to fight with my doctor and two secretaries for the paperwork, and then when I got my results 3 months later (great processing time - NOT) they STILL hadn't tested for anything! Planned Parenthood handles this sort of thing SO much better than a fricking Catholic Healthcare system. 
-1	I am pretty neutral with doctors - it is their job to tell me what is wrong, but most of the time, I already know what is wrong with myself. Ideally, I'd like to just get a solution to the problem from what I tell the doctors, instead of having to go through the process of them telling me what I already know. 
-1	He tries to help me. He also gets met the only prescription that I need full time. He is pretty helpful.
-1	I trust to a point. Aslso as stated he may opt for expedience and convenience whcih may compromise the outcome and care.   its a mix
-1	My primary care physician has never given me any reason to doubt her practices. She has always shown both compassion and knowledge. 
-1	Sometimes I think they may do what makes them the most money. They may not send you to a Specialist because it takes money away from them. They may also not listen to your idea because they feel they are always right.
1	i feel my doctor always has my best instrest in mind because he always fixes my problems. i trust him 100%.
1	I've known my primary care doctor for a long time already. He is a family friend, the husband of my mother's coworker. As a result, my trust in him is very high. 
-1	I would hope for the most part, they are honest with me and I can trust them, but you hear of so many things that happen, and they are so pressed for time usually, that I am always afraid they don't tell you everything in the limited amount of time you are there. My husband recently had to get something done, and they convenient left out some of the adverse side effects.
-1	I think that the medical profession has a rrow view of the patient and does not look long term.  It is ultimately up to me to decide on the course of action in my healthcare, after taking the advice of the doctor with a grain of salt.  I do not wholly believe that the doctor knows what is best for me after a brief office visit, only I can know and make this decision.
-1	The physician I see has years of experience along with a degree in subjects I have never even thought about taking. They are more knowledgable in what they are doing then i would never be, in return i would believe what they say. 
1	I've been going to the same doctor for 12 years and I completely trust her opinion. She takes her time with me and listens to everything I say. Since I had my children, she also cares for them and does a great job with them.
-1	"My current doctor is better than doctors I've had in the past, and he has been able to help me more; he listens to me more. Unfortutely he has some attitudes about certain newer medical conditions--one of which I almost certainly have--that makes it hard us to really ""connect."" He does discuss treatment plans with me on the things he CAN help me with, though."
-1	He did not provided all the answers I needed. It took him less than 5 minutes to see me and guess what's wrong with me. I felt like I visited a quack. I spent 100 dollars in which I can diagnose myself online for free.
-1	"I never get the sense that my doctor really cares about me. I feel like she is just ""punching the clock"" and not engaged in my healthcare."
-1	My doctor is very well intentioned, but he will opt for conventiol medicine without turning to lifestyle choices first. For example, he would immediately prescribe a statin rather than addressing food choices first. He would prescribe a thyroid drug without first asking if one is eating a lot of sea vegetables or other high-iodine foods. He recommends mammograms despite the evidence that they really don't save lives (in the aggregate), they simply make more people patients.
-1	I do not know.  I have not gone to a primary care physician in 17 years.
-1	I trust my doctor because she hasn't ever given me a reason not to trust her.
1	i trust him because when i have been to the doctor he has diagnosed my condition and treated it effectively with a few exceptions.  I don't like to go to the doctor though and if i can still function with my illness i will try to ignore it until it goes away.
1	My doctor always seems to explain and talk about everything that i have any questions over and it's always quick and to the point but they are also somewhat hurried.
1	I trust my doctor. He really seems to care and treats me like family.
1	My PCP is a very reliable man. He listens to me when I report symptoms and places an importance on my physical and mental health, my overall well-being. He has expressed concern for my health and has instructed me to follow necessary steps to becoming healthier in my everyday life. I appreciate and respect his feedback, and I know that he is looking out for my best interest.
-1	Doctors are only people. While highly trained and educated, it is important to make decisions based on what is best for me, the patient. 
-1	I have went thru a few primary care physicians in the last 2  years. I've had trouble finding one that wants to listen and help me with my problems. They always seems like they are rude, in a hurry or just push me off on to a specialist. Thats not what I want. 
1	my doctor has really been great for me in the past. Him and his office have treated me spectacularly through a number of different situations that have arose. I haven't ever felt rushed or uncared for after seeing him.
1	My doctor listens to my concerns and explains things thoroughly. If I have a concern, my doctor makes other options available and reassures me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is thorough and always asks me the right questions. She takes the time with me that expect and answers all my questions and handles all of my concerns. She has a great reputation.
1	My doctor is very experienced.  I can tell much about my doctor by his mannerisms.
1	Perhaps it's because I haven't had a severe condition that has caused me to question my doctor's judgment, but I have had only positive interactions with my PCP and have received appropriate treatments. I am always given the chance to talk about my problems and able to ask questions. I never feel as though I'm being rushed out the door on an assembly line to make room for another patient, but that I am being treated by someone who is interested in getting to the root of my health problem.
1	I've known this doctor for a long time. He's very trustworthy and kind. I believe in him.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for a while.  She is very thorough.  If there is a question about treatment or diagnosis, she will refer you elsewhere.
1	I normally trust my doctor but I do have ideas of my own for treatment when I think I can use something more tural vs pharmaceutical. 
-1	sometimes i feel like i am told i need things i don't really need to milk money out of me. i do not think they would harm me but just trivial things that aren't needed are made to sound like bigger deals then they actually are.
1	I just like him and he is knowledgeable.  I can always research on the internet.  He answers my questions and is patient and kind.
-1	i dont have other choice, im not a doctor
1	I have had the same doctor for over ten years and she has always gotten the diagnosis right the first time. I have complete trust in her and we can talk about anything. She always spends time with me and answers my questions.
1	I just made a appointment with my primary I had never seen him or any primary but I thought of my gynecologist who I've seen for years. I trust her because she has kept me healthy and is very polite. She is easy to talk to.
-1	I trust my doctor because he gives me good advise and when I am having an issue , he is always helpful . He explains to me what to do and what are my best options to feeling better. 
-1	I do trust the doctors I see for the most part. In a few cases it seems that they are not engaging with me emotiolly. If I feel emotiol connected to a doctor I am more likely to trust them
1	"I have known him my entire life, and he is a second father to me - very, very close family friends who helped raise me. He is calm, ratiol, compassiote, and works with patients by listening to what they know is going on in their own bodies, what's ""normal"" for them, etc, instead of railroading them. Pharma reps have 0 influence on him - he is above reproach morally. He's going to retire soon and I don't know what I'm going to do!"
1	I trust my primary care doctor.  I have a very open relationship with him.  He will tell me the good things as well as the bad things.  I think that he is focused on recommending the best things for me as a patient.  I believe that his recommendations change based on the patients that he is dealing with.
-1	I've had many bad persol experiences with physicians in the past. Several have initially denied treatment because they didn't think their patient (my wife) was acting in enough pain for her condition that they eventually correctly diagnosed and medicated. Many have been uble to diagnose fairly common conditions. One LITERALLY told me the video game Street Fighter caused demons to come out of my TV and give me a skin rash that was later properly diagnosed as scabies. That is not a joke, or me having a go at the survey. That actually happened. Many doctors only seem to care about money, many don't care about their patients. I have had a few positive experiences as well, but as I lack a permanent primary care physician I've not had many positive experiences.
1	I feel I get many explations throughout any of my appointments that educate me on what is happening and why at all times.  It is very helpful to be able to feel educated. 
-1	"I trust my PCP to a certain extent, not because I feel that she has negative motives, but more because I know she is human and prone to make mistakes just like everyone else. I know she may have a bad day and may not be at her best. So while I trust her medical knowledge, I don""t put 100% faith in everything she says or does."
-1	I feel that my doctor is generally knowledgeable and competent; I just think that sometimes my sessions are rushed through, as if I'm just another customer to pay for their services. I don't distrust my doctor, but I do often believe that my doctor should spend more time with me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them since I was young. My whole family goes to the same practice and we have had a lot of positive experiences and received good health care.
1	my doctor is no nonsense and to the point. he does not sugar coat things and has never kept anything from me. trust him implicitly.
-1	I trust my pcp because she always take time to make sure I understand and really explains all my options and possible outcomes. 
-1	I trust doctors in general, but sometimes if the place is busy I might feel like they don't care very much about me but more about moving to the next person. I don't like it when doctors don't seem to care about a more persol engagement.
-1	I think doctors miss a lot of things because they are trained to treat the symptoms and not the causes. They don't often trust that people know their own bodies.
-1	I know he receives samples from pharm reps. I also know that is what I'll be walking out of his office with. 
1	My doctor has never wronged me. He is very friendly and always answers my questions. He genuinely cares about my health and his solutions have always worked.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes her time when she is seeing me, she is knowledgeable, smart, kind, caring, wants to help me whenever I am sick or need to discuss something with her. She always has my best interest and in mind when she is tending to my health needs.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has helped me whenever I went there with a problem. He has always figured out what the issue was and alleviated the symptom. He is also good at making things easy to understand so I would not be confused.
1	I trust my doctors because I have been going there for some time. They listen to my concerns and thoughts then add their input. If I disagree with something they say they will listen and try to find a better altertive. I do what a doctor tells me is best to do.
1	I pick doctors that really care about good outcomes and satisfied patients. Also, if a doctor gives the hint that he/she isn't doing the right thing I will question and leave if necessary.
-1	I feel that medicine is a business and not a one on one profession.   The doctor tries to make money off you.
-1	I overall trust my doctor but there is so much information out in the world regarding health and sicknesses and treatments that he couldn't possibly know everything that is best for me.
1	He's been my doctor for years. Whenever something is wrong, we can general figure out a fix. If there's ever problem we can't work through together, he sends me to a specialist.
1	My primary care physician is kind and answers any questions that I may have. He is also very careful and mostly remembers when I last visit him. I think he cares a lot about his patients.
1	I think my trust comes mainly from the time my dr. is willing to spend with me. She takes the time to talk and get to know me and what my life looks like. She integrates any options into what works in my situation. 
1	I've been with my doctor for about 5 years now and she has always taken the time to answer my questions and address any concerns that I have, even taking extra time to figure issues out.
1	I have had the same physician since I was very young and he has always taken my concerns seriously. I have never had any issues with him. He always addresses my concerns and has been proactive about addressing any health problems I may have. He is always patient in answering questions or concerns.
-1	idk
1	I trust my Dr because he takes the time to explain things to me and answer any questions I may have.
-1	I do trust my PCP.
-1	I don't believe I have any serious medical conditions.  My physician doesn't seem too concerned about me.  Some mistakes have been made when I visited him.
-1	From my last couple experiences with my doctor I feel that they have my best interests in mind and that they are trying to help me, but I feel they are overworked and sometimes don't have enough time to get to know me.
1	My primary care physician is very friendly and likable. She always makes sure that I feel comfortable and I understand all of my options.
-1	Sometimes my doctor doesn't listen to my main concern and instead changes the subject and discusses other things that I didn't come in to discuss that day. 
1	I have been with my primary care physician for five years now and she has always steered me in the right direction. I feel I have total trust in her and always listen to and follow what she says. 
1	I have been with my PCP for 10 years. I have always felt like I could tell her everything, like being a lesbian and an alcoholic.
1	It took me a while to find my current doctor because I wanted someone who listens and seems to care about me. I completely trust my doctor because he is an excellent listener and cares very much about my well being, he takes his job extremely seriously and I can tell he does this because he truly does care for people.
1	"Just saw my PA yesterday. Here's what I wrote in the survey sent by the hospital. ""Kandace has literally saved my life. I had an onset of PMDD and was suicidal. Her triage nurse, ncy, took my concerns seriously and got me in within 2 hours. I had untreated lifelong anxiety disorder and had been on five different benzos. Kandace put me on Zoloft and I had peace of mind for the first time in FIFTY years. I had debilitating sinus migraines and she put on Allegra and I haven't had one since. She diagnosed hypothyroidism when I came in bundled up for Antarctica. She has controlled my HBP. She diagnosed a Vitamin D3 deficiency confirmed by blood test. She is simply the best primary care provider I have ever had in my 66 years."""
-1	It's not a question of trust, but I know what's best for me. A doctor is an adviser, not the end-all be - all. I trust my docs, but as they say, I trust my mother, but I still cut the cards
1	He is honest and upfront. He listens to my needs and answers any questions I may have without making me feel rushed
-1	She listens to what I say, she remembers or has notes about my concerns from previous visits (such as disdain for taking drugs).  Sometimes I wish she was a bit more firm with me about things like my weight, etc.
-1	I trust him for the most part. But, even he can have gaps in knowledge and is perhaps more wanting to do the expedient thing than the most thorough. 
-1	I do not have complete trust in any doctor. You have to be your own advocate. Doctors struggle with the amount of time spent with patients versus the number of people that need to be seen each day. Any time I am given a medication or advice from a doctor, I do my own research before trusting it completely.
1	I trust my primary care physician because in the past he has never gave me any reason to doubt him. Every time I've came in with a question or concern, he's spent the time to sit down with me and address all of my concerns. He's never tried to rush me me out or just disregard me. I am very comfortable around him, and would go to him about any medical concern I had.
1	I trust my primary physician because I have seen her for a long time now and she has never let me down. She's always helpful, always within reach, and she has never given me bad advice. I trust her because I consider her a friend and she feels the same way.
-1	I have just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I don't want to go into my persol history but sometimes they don't care about patients. 
1	My PCP always sits and listens to me and together we choose an appropriate course of action.  She explains anything I question.
1	I have only know my newest primary care physician for about 6 months. My past primary care physician was used for almost a decade. I believe a relationship with a doctor is important. I'm not saying that will not develop with my newest doctor, but at the time total trust is not present. 
-1	My primary care physician has been generally thorough and helpful, and when he says something is wrong he is very thorough in providing me with all of the information about treatment options available to me. However, I answered neutral for some of my responses because there was a time when I had a lot of non-specific symptoms and eventually began having a lot of pain, and he did not look much further into it and prescribed me muscle relaxers. I visited again and his PA took the time to do a full examition and determined based on my pain that I had fibromyalgia, which also explained many of my other nonspecific symptoms. In this case, I don't believe my PCP was as thorough during the visits I made to him because he didn't discuss this possibility with me. 
1	My doctor is a great doctor.  He tells you straight about medical information.  I have researched him and he does not participate in pharmaceutical company kickbacks.
-1	I have a rare disease. It took 4 years and several doctors before I filly got a diagnosis and effective treatment. Along the way, I had doctors who were well-meaning but unhelpful, doctors that accused me of lying, doctors that ignored me and forced me to go to a patient advocate to get them to follow through. I've learned that it isn't in my best interests to assume that any doctor can be completely trusted.
1	I trust mines because I have not experience anything that went wrong as of yet.
1	I generally trust doctors and trust their professiolism most of all. I think they have more insight and I don't feel like I have to challenge it or anything like that.
-1	She takes the time to listen to my concerns. She fully explains all test results to me and answers all my questions without hesitation.
-1	Doctors are fallible human beings, no different than you or I and they can, and do make mistakes.  What is in their best interest may not be in yours as well.
-1	I wouldn't trust a doctor 100%, I would seek a 2nd opinion if there was ever a serious matter. 
1	I have known my doctor for years and he has always been good to me. I haven't ever had a reason to stop trusting him.
-1	My doctor usually gives me the news straight and goes over treatment plans.  I have seen my health improve in the last 2 years since going to this doctor so I trust future advise he gives me. 
-1	I don't care for my primary car physician. I feel like I am just a number as she quickly would complete my visit and rarely answer questions. When I truly had a need she didn't have any advice for me and didn't offer to converse with her colleagues to find out.She also didn't listen to me and caused me several scares during my first pregncy. I haven't seen my PCP in 6 years because of it. 
-1	I feel like most doctors will try their best, but I have experience with some who have clearly not known what they are doing. So while I generally trust them, I am always skeptical.
-1	I believe my doctor is looking out for my best interest, that being said he is only human and is prone to making mistakes like everyone else. But deep down I do think he cares about my well-being.
1	I trust a doctor to know more about what is wrong when it is an infection or severe injury. Mild injuries including soreness and stitches have had moderately incorrect diagnoses. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I've never been given a reason not to. They are the medical professiols with years of training and education and I should defer to their recommendations unless they give me a reason not to trust them.
-1	My doctor does not make me feel like they have my best interest fully at heart because the last time I went in for an ongoing, painful issue they ran tests and told me that they did not know what was wrong, that was it. No further follow up to figure out what the problem was. 
-1	They seem to worry about other issues when I go to see them. I went for a sore throat and end up getting a test for something else.
1	I have had the same primary care doctor for over 10 years. She is very thorough and explains her reasoning for any medication that she prescribes. She listens and pays attention to what I have to say.
-1	He may not have the best bedside manner but he's always utd on all new and current medical information and I feel I get great care just too faced paced if that makes sense
-1	My dr has helped me with several things over the last couple if years. She has even let me try a couple of meds that i had wanted to. I seem to do well under her care.
1	I feel that my doctor-patient relationship is well established and she feels comfortable telling me things even if I won't agree with them. She is aware I will ask questions and I will always be respectful even if I disagree with her recommendation. 
1	My PCP has been very open about her reasoning and thought processes and gone out of her way to set me up with the next steps for me to pursue. She listens to my concerns and thoughts as well.
-1	
-1	I generally trust my doctor. I have been with him for years and would not continue the relationship if I had doubts about his care. When it comes to my health I am somewhat cautious so I do not completely trust my doctor.
1	My primary physician hasn't failed me yet. The other week I went in because I had an horrible cough and headache. He took a look into my ears and prescribed antibiotics, one week later I am feeling better.
-1	I trust my physician because I know he graduated from a really good medical school. He also is very kind and takes him time to explain everything so you can understand it.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician or else I would be choosing another physician.  I am also aware that physicians are busy and that sometimes things can get missed in a busy office so it is my responsibility to keep myself well-informed regarding tests, results and treatments and to ask questions if needed.  
-1	I would like to think that doctors have the patients best interest at heart. I would also think that they have seen many cases of certain illnesses and have  lots of experience in dealing with the problem. However, sometimes, I think that a doctor can have ulterior motives but most likely not.
1	I have been seeing my current doctor for nearly 2 years, but my experience with doctors in general is very consistent. Every time I have a question about my overall health or a specific condition, my doctor is able to clearly explain his thoughts on the matter. 
1	My doctor does not dance around subjects and outright tells me what is wrong and how or why I should fix things if they need medical attention. 
-1	Everyone I go in with a concern I get a few words in  then suddenly there is medicine without test..
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for years now, and he is very familiar with me and my history. He has never steered me wrong, and he listens attentively to any questions I have. I have a great deal of trust in him.
-1	I believe that some doctors pay attention to you, but some do not. My current doctor i don't believe listens to me. When i first was going through menopause i felt like i was going crazy to have some much anxiety. He was a young doctor and i felt like he was looking at me like i just wanted drugs. He never explained to me all that goes along with menopause.
1	I trust my doctor because he is always blunt and honest. If I'm doing something to cause the issue he will tell me, and he gives me realistic ideas of the end results or recovery time. 
-1	My doctor is usually very good at explaining the mechanisms behind any diagnosis she give. But, when I got bloodwork done she completely overlooked something that has been shown to give symptoms that I was having. She immediately prescribed medication rather than trying to find out what the cause of my abnormal bloodwork was.
1	I don't feel like he pushes medication on me, which is a fear I have regarding most doctors. I don't want a doctor who is in the pocket of Big Pharma. 
1	"I trust my doctor because he is very direct and ""no-nonsense"".  He explains things very clearly and presents me with options."
-1	"My GP has been great over the years. Rarely has he said ""trust me I'm a doctor"" He has a fantastic group of referral physicians and surgeons and has never steered me wrong with any medical treatment or diagnosis, unless there is little known about it then we both work on it"
1	I've been with my doctor for almost a decade and she know my body inside and out! I trust her judgment because, so far, she's been correct about any issues I've had regarding my care. She is well educated and stays abreast of the latest advances in medicine, which she shares with her patients. 
-1	They have more medical training than me. I do not know anything regarding the field of medicine and that is their job. I have to depend on what they know, similar to how people depend on me for IT advise.
-1	I have had hard to diagnosis conditions in the past and because I go to a large HMO where the doctors have a huge client load, I feel that there is no way that a doctor can adequately diagnosis this type of condition. After a doctor's appointment, I often combine research that I've done online with what they say or prescribe. 
-1	They have never given me a reason not to trust them and everything they've ever done for me worked out well. I also generally agree with the treatment or advice they give me too.
1	i have had the same doctor for 10 years and know him and his decision making abilities and he has a good persoble quality and is fairly accurate
-1	As I only see a doctor once every few years, I would say I have had no reason to mistrust any of them.  In general, I feel I have been given adequate information and care.
-1	I haven't been seeing them long and when I do it's short. I get basic stuff answered. It still feels like business. Generally I trust them, because when I do ask questions about risks and side effects, it sounds like they're being honest.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he is patient with me, listens to all I have to say and consults with me regarding his decisions.  He has very well trained office staff that provide excellent services.
1	I trust my primary physician based on how he has helped me in the past. He is always thorough and I went through other doctors before sticking with him. He always explains the options and when possible, we decide things together.
-1	I will never trust anything in this medical system ever again. It is as simple as that.
1	I trust my doctor because she is always honest with me about everything and explains things in terms that I can understand. 
-1	Sometimes I think she doesn't listen to all my concerns or tries to easily explain away or dismiss my concerns.  I would like for her to try to resolve each issue and not blow me off.
-1	Sometimes they don't listen to everything I need to tell them, and they come to a conclusion/diagnosis before I tell them everything I'm experiencing. Sometimes I'm left with some concerns. However, I generally trust their judgment.
1	My primary care physician is always patient with me and does not seem rushed. He is very clear in his explations of his diagnosis and how to move forward no matter the issue. He is able to provide trustworthy and good recommendations in my experience. 
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, and in fact, don't really have one that I would call my primary.  When I do go, though, it is usually for a specific issue, sickness, or injury and I always have the feeling the doctor just wants to get me in and out so he or she can get on to the next one.  I rarely feel like they have my best interest at heart.
-1	While there may be those in the field who truly want to help others, the bottom line is that people will look after themselves one way or another. I don't trust anyone. Doctors are no exception.
1	Docs are only human, by definition they are not perfect.
-1	Almost all drs in this country have to follow the deranged findings of the government and the funding of the drug companies. 
1	I generally trust my doctor since I switched to him after having a bad experience with a previous doctor, and my current doctor was very honest in giving me new treatment options. He is very good at communication and seems to listen very closely and with interest in what I say. 
1	My primary care physician is my uncle, so I've known him my entire life and certainly do not think he'd put any concerns above my health. Also because he's a family member I've had lots of people approach me who are patients of his to tell me how much they trust him as well. As a doctor, he's both extremely careful and reassuring, and very experienced.
-1	Well, I marked neutral on all these because my PCP has only been with me 4 months. If i don't believe in my doctor or the doctor doesn't have faith in me about fixing things with a diet and exercise they get the boot. If they don't listen to me or make me feel ignored they get the boot.  So far I like him and he is  being a cheerleader for me 
1	My doctor is very open and honest with me. He never rushed me, answers all of my questions. He goes above and beyond by calling and checking on me. He is very genuine in his treatment.
-1	Physicians are people and they make mistakes. They can be persuaded with money and gifts to be biased towards certain treatments. They can have fincial interests that bias them towards treatments, too.
-1	They have good intentions and want to help. They also have rules and regulations they have to comply with and don't have the time to get into the details about individual patient care. I trust that they are giving good advice, but it's only part of the picture. As an adult I need to research any conditions I have and find the best overall plan to treat it, including their treatment recommendations or medicines. 
1	My doctor seems to be honest and trustworthy. She has given me good medical advice in the past and I can't see a situation, unless something changes drastically, where I wouldn't trust her. 
-1	In my experience, doctors tend care less about their patients if their patients have free health care. When I did, the doctor I had kept trying to convince me to get as few tests done as possible, and never told me the results of those tests. Whereas if I had been paying out of pocket or had really good insurance, they probably would have given me every test in the book whether I asked for it or not. They have also been far too dismissive. When I go to a doctor, I want to know if a problem is real or in my head. If the doctor says there's nothing physically wrong with me, then that gives me a way to understand what's going on with me. But a doctor that refuses to help is a pointless doctor to spend your time and money on.
-1	Just his general presence and how he is willing to explain everything in detail and will allow extra time in appointments to go over any concerns I may have.
1	I trust them because they committed to very many years of schooling to do what they do. They're trained in their profession and do it nearly every day which quickly builds experience. The most experience I have is Google searches so I have no choice but to put my trust in them.
-1	I believe that for the most part physicians have their patients' best interests in mind. However, because of the economics of healthcare in this country a patient's interests might not always be met.
-1	There's just really no way to know how much one can trust one's doctor. Sometimes the doctor may make an honest mistake--how much do you trust the doctor then? Does it depend on the consequences of that mistake?
1	I think that when it comes to healthcare you should trust but verify. I think that there is a common way to deal with problems, but it is not always what is best for your undiviual needs. I like to learn what my doctor recommends but also look for other options and tural treatments as well. I think my doctor is awesome, but she is just human, and therefore it is important to have other ways of obtaining other opionons. 
-1	I don't fully trust doctors in general because I've had bad experiences with them in the past. I feel like the process to become a doctor 1lpeople who actually care from completing it, and a lot of doctors I've met are self centered and see patients as puzzles instead of real people.
1	my doctor hasn't given me any reason to doubt his thoroughness, especially since i follow up his treatment with my own research on other treatments and medicines.
1	She listens to my concerns and offers options. I have learned that I need to write down my symptoms over time and let her know what I've been feeling and for how long. She is then quite willing to listen and explore options
-1	When I delivered my baby it was near dinner time at the close of the business day and the doctor wanted to be done. He was frustrated that I had a birth plan that I asked him to follow when there was no medical indication not to and he injured me by speeding up the delivery in yanking out my baby. Following that there have been instances where I have sought help for a condition I have and the doctor has only told me he doesn't want me to continue the treatment I have been using without an explation as to why and he was pushing me to use a contraceptive rather than the altertive treatment that has been effectively working. 
-1	I recently encounter a medical situation in which most of the problem was created by doctors non-expertise in that area. 
-1	I like her a lot and she hasn't steered me wrong so far.  I feel like she's honest with me about her opinions and my options.
-1	Doctors in general prescribe generalized medications with no intention of correcting an issue but merely masking the effects
-1	I haven't been seeing my PCP for that long.  For a long time I didn't have one, and this Dr. was one that was accepting new patients.  I find her manner rather brusque and hurried, I actually need to make her stop and answer questions.  I get a lot of my information from the nurses, but i want to hear it from the Dr.  She seems to always be thinking about her next patient instead of me.  I feel like I don't hold her attention for even the five minutes she spends with me.  For that reason, I will be looking for another PCP, it's just hard to find one that will accept new patients.
-1	I have felt rushed in the examition room, even though my doctor was kind. I was also prescribed something and told it wouldn't affect my mood at all. In fact it made me extremely anxious, and the research I did on my own, after the fact, cautioned that it would.
-1	While i trust that doctors are often doing their best and have reasons for why the do or do not recommend certain treatments, I do think they fall into patterns and often disregard complimentary medicines. They can be quick to prescribe medication or surgery with holistic remedies or simple dietary changes can help. Doctors are people and they are flawed and I believe that just like many other people, provide better care to patients they feel connected with. I feel like i have a responsibility as a patient to do my own research and ask questions. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have yet to receive bad advice from them. They have also been a doctor for a long time, so they have valuable experience that help my trust
-1	He's nice and doesn't belittle my complaints.
-1	Doctors are only interested in what your insurance can cover-period! It's very difficult to find a decent doctor who will consider what is best for the patient and sometimes their treatment is worst than the decease itself!
-1	He's been my doctor since I was a teeger. He is pretty blunt about telling you what is going and why. He is pretty thorough in his questions too. But if you smoke or anything, he'll tell you to expect a stroke.
-1	My primary care physician did not build a good rapport with me. I felt like, if I had to bring my child to an appointment, she cared more about holding my baby than caring for me
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have gone to their practice since I was a newborn and have had no problems, and have handled all of my vaccines and health issues appropriately with them. I figure that my doctor knows a lot more about health than I do and that alone is a reason to invest a lot of trust in them.
-1	I have been going to my doctor for over 20 years, I trust her. I feel as if she treats me based on my needs not as a guideline of treatment, but for individual needs. She talks to me like a person and shows respect and compassion.
-1	"My PCP is worthless. i have been going there for 5 years, sick as a dog, and he keeps telling me I am ""healthy as a horse"" on paper. Just great.  I am in the process of finding another doctor before i croak."
1	My doctor tells me like it is. She's honest and thorough with me. She tries to relate to me. And speaks to me in a way I would understand.
-1	Hes there to make money.  He has his own agenda, and sometimes I feel like he ends up only doing the least amount to help me so I will  have to come in again so he can make more money off of me.
1	My doctor has always had my trust and has not failed me yet. So I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	I feel that with my interactions with my primary care physician he shows a good amount of concern for my well being. I trust him because he gives me all the information I need to make a decision and gives me his opinions and experience to help me.
1	I don't see my primary care doctor very often, but I do see my gastroenterologist on a regular basis. I trust him because I've been seeing for three years. In that time, I've been hospitalized when I was very ill and he made the right medical decisions for me. He's always informative when I see him and explains things well. I have never had any problems during any interaction with him.
1	I trust that my doctor knows what is best for me. If he tells me something I have a disagreement on, I question his logic. I know my body pretty well and he knows that I give him all the information he needs to make a decision about treatment. I don't hold back and he doesn't either. 
1	She takes the time to really understand what is happening and asks thoughtful questions to provide better health treatment without making you feel guilty about how you responded to her. She makes thoughtful suggestions without coming off as pushy or judgemental.
-1	Looking for another doctor in the city
-1	It's not that I don't trust them it's they always seem to have altertive agendas then what you feel you need. You go in for one thing and they test you for eight other things, they find out what's wrong and then they experiment with different medicines. 
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because in the past they regularly suggest things that aren't necessary, but that are extremely expensive. They seem to have no understanding that not everyone can afford anything they want. They act like money is no object. I don't think they're looking out for my best interest.
1	I've been with my primary care physician for several years, and we have a good relationship. I feel like my physician is open and forthcoming with me, and I feel like I can be as well in return.
1	I trust my physician because I have a long history over many years. I have experience with situations where there were options and feel my physician always had my best interest at heart and offered me the truth.
-1	I have seen different doctors throughout my life for regular healthcare visits. These have typically been older physicians. I trust their experience and judgement from having practiced medicine for many years. I haven't always agreed with everything they've mentioned but I believe they recommend what they do to the best of their abilities and due to trying to err on the side of caution.
-1	I feel as if some times my doctor is not listening to my whole story. I try to say something and it is sometimes disregarded when I believe it would be important to take into consideration.
-1	After years of having pain and getting sick, I am still no closer to knowing what is wrong with me that I was 6 years ago. I never seem to get answers to why I am sick, and even after tests the doctors still don't know. I am so frustrated by this. I don't have health insurance and have to go to a clinic and never get the same health care provider twice.  There is no one to trust in my case.
-1	There are a lot of changes in medicine constantly and there are a ton of options it would probably take days  to cover the ones for each condition. Doctors tend to go with the simplest or maybe cheapest if that is the way insurance providers make you go. Sometimes the best answer is not simple or cheap.
1	She always goes above and beyond. She never stops trying until she finds whats wrong. 
-1	He's been my primary doctor for years already and his cure is always effective.
-1	i trust them. But no one is perfect so its best to do your own research as well as get a doctors opinion.
1	because my doctor will always give me choices and will always be honest with me. He will advise me on what to take and what not to take .
1	I trust my primary care physician due to actually taking the time to listen to what I am saying and talking with me about what the right path is for me.
-1	I have never had to see my primary care doctor for anything serious, so I might feel differently if that were the case. All in all, I think my doctor can be trusted and has given me no reason to think otherwise.
-1	I don't think MDs know all of the options for treatment and, therefore, always recommend the options that they are most familiar with or have the latest buzz in jourls or commercials or get the best meals from the local sales representative. They are human and they habits and are easily influenced.
1	I have been going to him for over 20 years.  He is frank with m.  he make sure I always no the score.  He does not beat around the bush, and I appreciate that.  
-1	I generally trust my doctor.  If I had doubts, I would seek a second opinion. My doctor has many years experience and I am generally in excellent health.
1	I have known him for quite awhile.  he is well respected and has an excellent reputation.  He always takes time to talk with me and address any concerns that i might have. 
-1	He has studied medicine a lot more then I have, but the things I have researched have aligned with what he has told me.
-1	I feel like my doctor does what is easiest when it comes to my medical condition. I don't think my doctor cares much about my wellbeing. He is just doing a job that he may or may not even care about.
-1	i trust my doctor because she knows more than i do about human bodies. i can look things up and give her my symptoms, but at the end of the day she knows a lot more than i do about how things work. I trust her.
-1	I think my doctor has my interest in hand. I trust that my needs are important .
-1	I trust my physician in part but there are things that I think he could miss. Also I like my doctor but he is only human.
1	My doctor never seems to be hurried and answers all of my questions in depth.
1	I never trust anyone completely, however I truly believe that most doctors are truthful and honest or the most part when talking to the clients
-1	My last primary care physician wasn't necessarily a bad doctor, but she was pretty busy and quick to get my appointments over with. She even ended up missing key signs of a very serious problem I was having by diagnosing the symptoms as common ailments that had nothing to do with each other though she's not to blame for that (it was a very bizarre chain of events that led to the discovery of my problems). I know she did what she could with what she knew but I think if she spent more time with me in my appointments, maybe she would have seen something different.
1	My primary care physician is very thorough in explaining things and likes to make sure I understand what she has told me before the visit ends. 
-1	They didn't go to school that long and learn nothing
-1	I'm in between PCPs (switched insurance based on marriage). I answered the questions based on my last one, who was a resident, fresh out of med school. She would take a lot of time to talk with me about issues, but more for herself/understanding things. She referred me to a dermatologist for an issue I still have, and I completely mistrusted the derm because he wanted me on 4 medications for something simple, even after I told him none of them worked in the past. This made me not want to trust my old PCP in her referral judgement.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for almost 20 years now. He knows me and I feel like I am at home there. I can come to him with any problem at all and he knows what to do. He has never let me down once. He know when we can speed through and exam but if I have any questions or need to talk he will stay with me as long as I need him to explain or talk to me.
-1	She put me on a medication and took me off another cold turkey and I developed serotonin syndrome which has completely turned my life upside down.
-1	I feel like the time spent with me is probably not enough to accurately diagnose and help. I think my doctor has good intentions, and is very knowledgeable, but probably too busy. 
1	I answered this about my mother's main surgeon. He removed her colon, ovaries, uterus, gallbladder, appendix and spleen. We went through four surgeon consults before I found the one we have now. I kept going back to our PCP and getting additiol referrals until I found one I liked. The first four were complete nightmares.They had neither the time or inclition to answer my questions thoroughly and were arrogant. I refuse to accept sub par medical care. I think hospitalists should get with the program and understand that their patients are CONSUMERS and while they are selling a highly specialized product, they do not have a monopoly.
-1	I believe that doctors and general can easily get caught up in the formulaic behavior of routinely prescribing prescription for patients A, B, and C, so when the next patient comes along with a similar issue it is just a wag of their pen to get them out of their office and another person into the exam room and go on with their day. 
1	I've been going to her office for a few years now and I'm always impressed by her high intelligence, her warmth, her competence and professiolism and the way she is always calm, attentive, quick and relaxed at the same time. And she is also greatly regarded in the profession - she has won many awards, which definitely inspires confidence.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I usually have a lot of questions to ask them when I come in for visits. They take the time to answer those questions and break down the technical answers into something I can understand. They also have taken care of all the other members of my family as well for years. So a long bond with our physician created that trust over many years.
1	After a visit I check everything he has told me.
1	I trust my doctor, she asks good questions and always seems to take the time necessary to understand my needs. She doesn't seem in a hurry like other doctors I've seen in the past. 
1	I trust what my Doctor tells me as I have been a patient of hers for a number of years. 
-1	I trust them but not one hundred percent. The reason its not 100 percent is due to the fact that I feel they are in bed with big pharma. They are always trying to get you to take some sort of pill. Thats why I dont trust them completely. They at times seem to have ulterior motives with these pills. They wont hurt you, just push them like dealers. 
-1	"The dummy put me on birth control for headaches and then when I spiraled into panic attacks and depression, then came the zoloft and birth control. I knew there ""had"" to be some other answer because this all just came on so suddenly. They want to give you the typical ""disease"" bullshit and that you'll be on meds the rest of your life to mage. F no. I spent days and asked the universe several times to lead me to the answer, and it did. My diet was high protein, high fat, high processed vegan junk food, and ever since switching to a high fruit, mostly raw vegan lifestyle, I becoming a new person, and don't need their bullshit meds. They get handouts for prescribing meds to people and they don't fully understand the lymphatic system, in fact they completely ignore it. Unless Dr. Morse on youtube who was the ONLY one, that actually completely explained the lymphatic system, how all diseases are connected and the underlying problem of too much acid chemistry in our bodies."
1	I trust doctors to know what's best for patients because they have the required knowledge and training to diagnose these problems and provide accurate information to help solve issues.
-1	I don't completely trust my pcp. It often seems that if they don't properly diagnose a condition the first time, that they want to blame the patient instead of looking further to figure out exactly what the problem is. I feel like a lot of the time, they can't be bothered to listen, because in their minds, they've already decided what the truth is. 
1	My physician is very though and takes the time to explain things to me. And he shows patients and eager to answer all my questions. And makes sure that I completely understand before I leave his office. He always make sure we have a plan and a time when we will follow up.
-1	I trust my doctor because he does not beat around the bush. He tells me when I need to address something or if I am over reacting. He also tells me to not be afraid to get a second opinion. That he is only human and that he wants me to feel comfortable and if that means getting another doctor's opinion then so be it. 
1	I do trust my doctor.  He is very kind and thoughtful.  If I do not want to have an x-ray done, he does not force me to have it done.  He always asks me how I am feeling and if I have any questions and concerns that he can help me with.
-1	I trust my primary care provider a great deal.  He has done quite a bit to inform me of low cost options for treatment as well as flat out given me prescriptions.  He is also a big believer in preventative medicine.  The guy is a gem. 
-1	Doctors usually just want to peddle bullcrap expensive medicines that are just overhyped painkillers most of the time. $200 for painkillers is not justified, obviously there's some third party putting pressure on doctors to peddle this crap.
-1	The practice I go to has SO MANY PATIENTS. The care is generally good, but I often feeling like I'm on an assembly line and their time with me is on the clock, so they might be more expedient than thorough.  
1	I trust my doctor because he is very knowledgeable in his job and knows what he is doing and what is best for me to do and take.
-1	I have been several times to my doctor and have mentioned certain pains or issues and if it is not the focus of the visit they are kinda brushed off.  This has happened several times so I don't completely trust my physician.
-1	I think my pcp is adequate. She is nothing stellar and does her job. She sometimes need prodding to complete tasks such as refilling scripts. I need to ask her to look into things that are causing me problems and many times, I come away without an answer or a generic diagnosis.
1	I believe my doctor take the time to give the most important information and take time to explain things to me. And will route me to additiol sources so I trust her over all.
-1	I have no primary care physician now. Dealing with doctors in the past is the main reason I don't bother with them. I found them to rarely be good listeners. They are too concerned with covering their own ass these days than actually taking care of people.
-1	 Trust my primary care physician because not only did he go to school to be in his profession but he also has taken the time to get to know me.
-1	I usually trust my doctor if I agree with what they think is best to do and if I don't agree I question him.
1	My doctor takes his time and does not rush. He gives me many options for treatment and often asks for my preferences and input.
-1	I feel that because I am not diagnosed with detrimental medical conditions my doctor has less regard over optiol treatments for a condition. I have some regard for their opinions, but am not fine with the cost of some prescriptions written for my treatment.
1	I trust my doctor because the things that he has suggested to me regarding my health have always helped me. My doctor is patient and listens to me when I have questions.
1	I trust my PCP completely as he is the one who has the credentials, knowledege and experience to give advice and treat patients, including myself.I believe my doctor is honest and  I trust his decisions completely based on his thoroughness and willingness to answer and address any questions I have.
1	Although my PCP is fairly new to me (&gt;then one year) he quickly takes action on long term conditions I explain and gets me into the correct specialist if he is uble to provide treatment.  He listens well, asks about previous experiences, explains his ratiol and appears to be transparent in his thought process.
-1	I trust her for the most part. Any distrust I have stems from the fact that shes human and can make mistakes just like the rest of us. 
-1	I am lucky to have a great Dr. In the past, I have not. She listens. She knows me. She also has chronic pain, so that helps in her understanding.
1	She listens and responds.  She is warm and friendly and seems very interested in what I have to say.  She explains things in ways that are easily understood without being condescending. She treats me like a person.  
-1	I distrust western medicine in general. I feel it is a business more than anything else these days. I also feel it is ignorant about the conscious ture of the universe.
1	My primary care physician is direct to the point, and makes sure you understand what is going on.
1	I trust my doctor because he is compassiote about helping others and takes the time to answer any question I might have. I've always received prompt service and have never had to wait too long to be seen on in an office visit. He also has been willing to work with me if my insurance has not covered the full price of a medicine I needed.
-1	I feel my doctor doesn't really listen to me or take my concerns into consideration. He glosses over everything and will focus on something that isn't a true problem. I also feel he likes to give me every test in the world even if it doesn't pertain to any of my complaints. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel he genuinely wants to help. Whenever I seek him, he would give me all sorts of reasoble suggestions to help improve my health, responds to email, etc.
1	I trust my doctor will always do whats in my best interests.  They have the expertise that I lack.  I trust that they have seen similar cases and can react accordingly.
1	"In the past, I did not trust doctors much due to some bad experiences with being brushed off and accused of ""looking for attention"".  I have since dealt with two very nice doctors, both of which were easy to deal with and took me seriously.  They talk to me and help me through issues, explaining everything as necessary.  "
-1	Every time I go to the doctor they seem to be in a bad mood. I don't quite know but their face is always that of a person when they are angry and do not want to be bothered. This leads me to not ask any questions about how I feel health-wise. I end up leaving without getting the input I need most of the time.
-1	I've been going to my doctor for over 20 years.  He knows my history and persolity.  I can talk honestly with him and he'll have an engaging conversation.
-1	He seems sincerely interested in what is best for me.  He also sees others in my family and they feel the same way.  It is a feeling I have that he is trustworthy.  He has not given me any reason not to trust him.  I feel he is there to help.
-1	I do trust my doctor most of the time. But he only knows what the AMA has taught him. Medicine is centered around prescription medications and most, if not all, the time I believe there is a better tural solution. 
-1	I have had my doctor for a long time and she knows my history well. She also knows I prefer tural treatments and to monitor things instead of masking with pills etc. Because we have established a good rapport I do trust her when I need to make decisions about my health.
1	My doctor takes extra time to look for different altertives for me. She also always finds different ways to explain things to make sure I fully understand.
-1	It seems to me that more and more doctors are spread too thin in their practice having to see a maximum number of patients in as little time as possible, creating a less thorough exam or alysis of symptoms/ testing.
1	For the most part, I trust my primary care physician. I've seen doctor's before where they felt almost robotic in dealing with me. No emotion whatsoever and looked to have one foot out the door already. My current primary care physician is none of those things. It actually feels like he cares about my well being. He remembers things from my persol life in previous conversations and brings it up when I see him, like a human being. He takes the time to deal with me, which I like.
-1	I'm not a very trusting person in general which is why I answered as I did, but I trust my pcp as much as I trust as anyone. 
-1	In general, I would trust my doctor to recommend what he honestly believes is the best medical advice for me. However, I have done a fair amount of research and reading regarding certain health issues, and in general I don't trust the medical community to always have the best or most up-to-date information on some issues, particularly regarding nutrition and diet. 
-1	I spent time finding my primary care,  he's someone that is not overly difficult to talk to and has helped me with issues I previously was uncomfortable with other doctors.  He always gives me many options for medication with the materials to study them. 
1	I do trust my doctor for the most part.  I know that not a lot of doctors study nutrition or altertive forms of medicine so I also study on that to and make my own decisions.  My doctor is very thorough and seems to care about me.  I feel comfortable talking to her.
-1	Too many doctors follow a set of rules and protocol. They are not open to altertive medicine and would sooner give you medicine than try and treat things turally. They have too much at stake with the pharmaceutical companies.  
-1	I don't necessarily trust nor distrust the doctor.  I would assume I trust them more than distrust because she has been trained to be a doctor.
-1	It's not that I distrust my physician, it's that I distrust the medical establishment, to include govt intervention.  I trust that my physician is doing the best she can with the training provided by the medical establishment.  The reason I distrust the establishment is due to its record.   Food pyramid, dietary cholesterol, fats are bad, massive numbers of people on statins with no resulting drops in CVD related deaths.
1	My doctor seems very competent and knowledgeable. She makes sure to listen to my concerns before discussing treatments. If I have questions about the situation, she answers them thoroughly. She has many years of experience and seems to know what she is talking about.
-1	I trust my doctor with my health or else I wouldn't go to my physician. I am a person who once I find a trustworthy doctor, I will stay with them until I need to change physician or I am not able to.
-1	"I would never trust a doctor 100%.  Even if they're trying their best, they don't always know what's right.  If you have something rare wrong with you, it will usually take multiple doctors before you find one that gets it right.  Most doctors will treat you under the assumption that you have the ""most common thing"" wrong with you that has your particular set of symptoms."
1	My primary care physician is a human being. He sometimes has some mistake but I trust him
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been seeing him for over 15 years and every time I go there it is consistent.  I have no reason not to trust him.  I cannot speak for everybody else though, because I believe some doctors could be corrupt. 
-1	Doctors are sometimes just out to make money. They know people generally trust them blindly, and they are just giving an opinion, so they can tell you whatever they want. I don't think all doctors are like this, but some are and it's hard to know which ones are trustworthy. 
-1	I believe you have to trust them. If I'm not mistaken they sign some oath to verify they will be honest and forthright with patients, and do what's in there best interest.  Also they make good money, and if it was found out they were being deceitful it would be hard for them to find work.
1	My doctor seems to genuinely care about her job. She seems worried and really listening when I am telling her my problems. Then I can tell she is thinking hard and trying to help me to a solution.
1	We are very direct with each other. He doesn't  beat around the bush and makes suggestions and recommendations. I make the decisions, with his input. He doesn't always agree, but hey, I pay him, he don't pay me. He is not my boss. 
-1	i trust my doctor 
-1	"I feel that a lot of Doctors "" Herd Sheep"" because we don't have enough Doctors out there."
-1	My physician is reserved.  I do not feel totally comfortable with him.  He is nice but not very talkative.  He is a general doctor, so I am not sure that he is up on everything that is specialized.
-1	In general, as doctors have years of training to understand medical knowledge and how to apply it, I trust their judgement.
1	My primary care physician has my best interests and health in mind. He has always chosen the best options for the sicknesses that I had and brought me back to good health. I trust in his opinion and his explations of the issues that I deal with.
1	I believe they know what they are talking about. They take time to tell me things. They let me ask questions.
-1	Physicians are so busy I feel like they do not always take the time to fully listen and give all options. I trust that they would not put me in harm but I don't trust that I'm always given all available options. They are also highly restricted by insurance companies drug coverage etc.
1	I have not trusted all physicians completely, but my current one has been a gem. He's been completely kind, compassiote, gives multiple options and educates me on what he's telling me (whether I ask for further explation or not) and spends time with me instead of rushing. When I had blood work done, he called me persolly to discuss my results even though they weren't all that remarkable and gave me further thoughts on how best to approach my health.
-1	I don't think I currently have a primary care physician, but I don't always necessarily trust doctors in general. My sister has had really bad luck with certain situations so that doesn't help. She's type 1 diabetic and was underweight for a while and the doctors were trying to claim my parents malnourished her when in reality she was just thin and sick from the diabetes. She has some other symptoms going on that they've been trying to find the cause of for years and still haven't. I do believe they're trying their best in this situation but they're definitely not perfect.
1	I trust my PCP because she takes her time when evaluating my symptoms or concerns and doesn't try to rush through the evaluation as fast as she can.  She also reminds me of routine tests that I forget to schedule.
-1	I trust my primary care physician in general because I am intelligent enough to be able to tell if what they are saying makes sense. I always choose doctors carefully after much research and review and persol recommendations.
1	Because he answers all the questions that I ask, and gives me other altertives if needed.
1	Most of my experiences with doctors have been positive ones.  The exceptions are with two doctors I saw (one time each), who were employed by hotels I work at.  These positions are given to the lowest bidders, and both doctors were somewhat hostile and incompetent.
1	I trust my doctor because he cares about my diet. He also encourages me to exercise regularly. He is less likely to prescribe me medicines that I don't need.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is knowledgeable in his field. While I try to gain understanding through probing, I ultimately defer to his knowledge in coming to certain conclusions. Past experience has taught me that he is usually right, so that's another reason I generally trust him.
-1	I neither trust or distrust doctors. They seem to be in between when it seems like the really care about their patients or not. I don't see them too often, so I don't know alot about them.
-1	"She is young and doesn't really seem to have confidence in things.  I'll tell her my ailments and symptoms, but nothing really comes of it.  She'll prescribe some drug for depression or mood and have me come back in a month.  After a month, I always feel worse and she's just like ""huh""  Seems to me like it's more about getting you a prescription and out the door.  Get us in, prescribed, and out the door as soon as possible.  Who cares about your symptoms, the side effects of this new drug will make you forget about your old symptoms, because the side effects are worse. "
1	I see my physician as someone who truly believes in his work and entered this profession due to a strong desire to help people.  He has never failed to help me when I have gone to him with a problem and I have been completely satisfied with the results I have gotten.
1	She's kind but straight forward and tells me how it is. She listens to my thoughts and concerns. She's never given me a reason to not trust her.
1	My PCP has stood by me through 2 years of complicated medical issues collaborating with a team of doctors to ensure continued progress and diagnosis. He discusses all factors pros and cons with me and takes the time to ensure all factors are discussed. Time is one of the keys.
-1	My primary care physician has asked me to spell and remind her of the me of my rare condition each of the last four times I have seen her. She has often forgotten or ignored problems I was having. She seems overbooked and scattered. 
1	I have had a wonderful primary Dr. the last 5 yrs. He looks me in the eyes when I talk and it makes me feel that he is truly hearing me. He asks my opinion on treatment when it's an option. 
-1	Sometimes doctors prescribe you medication that you don't really need. They're also more likely to recommend a procedure that costs more. Doctors work to make money, I think there are few doctors who are ethical but most of the ones I've been to are not.
-1	I distrust my primary physician because when it comes to giving out medicine these doctors don't know exactly what is in it. So I feel like I should research the stuff my doctor said when I get home and then make a decision myself and talk to my doctor about it.
1	As I mentioned earlier, I've had the same doctor for a long time. I almost consider him a friend at this point. He may be one way with other people but with me I knowhe's completely honest and cares about my health over his wallet or time.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always treated me like a valued individual and explained things to me thoroughly. She is persoble and friendly but also knowledgeable and a fast talker. I really love my doctor.
1	I trust only as far as one can trust. Certainly I would not go to a doctor if I read poor reviews about him. I dont believe in intuition however if I get a very bad feel for a doctor based on how he approaches my questions or converses with me then I will find another. The only way to really trust is to have it built over time and that is the best I can do. Its never good to trust anyone 100% but you can establish a good level of trust based on past experience
-1	"My primary care doctor is fairly new. She has a new practice and I just signed up for treatment. However, she has not given me any reason to distrust her. For the most part, my trust is rated at ""neutral"" because I just don't have enough experience with her."
-1	"I had an experience with a doctor where he over prescribed pain medication.  I wrote an essay as a witness statement which was used in the case against the doctor by the India Attorney General.  When I was 16, I was hurting so bad and didn't know what to do so my parents took me to a pain magement clinic which would be described as a ""pill mill"".  I don't blame my parents at all.  The first thing I signed was a waiver for them to prescribe me opiates.  The first time he prescribed tramadol, ambien, vicodine, and a muscle relaxant.  He told me it would only be one month and then he would get me off all medication.  Months went by being told the same thing.  It took me 3 years to get off the medication.  I was a zombie.  Now all I need is medicil canbis, and no pills.  I feel better than ever.  This is why I don't trust any doctor and I don't  think I ever will."
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part, but at times I feel he rushes to get to the next patient. When I feel he is rushing, I usually wonder how thorough he has been in my case.
-1	I go to a nurse practitioner at a clinic.  I'm fairly happy with her but not completely.  I don't think they're that thorough and they've made a couple of mistakes in a fairly short time.  I'm considering changing to somewhere else.
1	I generally trust my doctor's years of expertise and practice in the medical field. However, I also know that medicine is not a precise science and that there is still much that is not known about health conditions that afflict the human body. I know that there is always some chance that I may be misdiagnosed no matter how experienced my doctor is. However, overall I feel that my doctor has the wherewithal and the knowledge to give me the treatment that I require. My doctor shows compassion and concern when I visit her and has always answered my questions with clarity.
-1	My Doctor is very young and seems to always be in a massive hurry. I just don't feel like he has enough life experience yet to really be able to diagnose to his full potential.
-1	I believe that the doctor is looking out for my best interest.  However, I also feel as though he is trying to make money with as little work as possible.
1	I trust him because I can tell he cares and is thorough and not dismissive of me. I have previously seen doctors who I do not trust, and who dismiss my symptoms or concerns, so I know what the other end of the spectrum feels like. 
1	I completely trust my primary physician because he is aware of my health issues and can suggest me with good care.I believe Doctors always work for our betterment.After God we have to trust God for cure.
1	I trust my doctor completely to give me the best available options.  Having this doctor for many years has built a relationship of trust in him.  I would follow any of his orders without question.
-1	I feel like people have flaws just like physicians do. Your doctor is not good at everything therefore could be wrong about things. It is always good to get another opinion
-1	My Primary care physician is actually pretty decent. She knows what she is talking about most of the time and is honest when she doesn't. That being said, she has been wrong about a few things, and is not as turally or holistically minded as I would like
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because he is extremely thorough. During appointments with him, he often exceeds the general '15-30min' exam time, but just because he's so informative. For example, the at my last appointment with him when we were discussing medication options, he was actually showing me published articles from the New England Jourl of Medicine so I can see the data for myself and be more informed in my decision. Obviously he's far more well versed in these things than I am, but he doesn't just assume that these things are 'beyond my comprehension'. He can explain things in a thorough yet not unnecessarily complicated way so I don't feel forced to just take whatever advice he gives me.
-1	"My doctor loves to golf and seems like that's his primary concern most times I'm there -- being able to get out of there early so he can hit the course. I call him a ""cough & cold doctor"". Basically he's good at that stuff, but for anything bigger I would prefer to see someone else (i.e. a specialist). I don't necessarily distrust him I just don't think he cares enough to dig deeper into things. He does what he has to to just barely get by."
1	"I trust my doctor to make the right decisions for my persol health.  I have never felt that I was ""putting out"" my doctor by my needs or questions. "
1	She is a very caring doctor and has always been very persoble.  She takes time to talk to me, address any concerns or issues.  She is very thorough and attentive and I feel this is what makes her a great doctor, she likes people and helping.
-1	I trust my primary care physician based on 4 years experience with her. I receive my care through VA and I know she's always busy, but, hey, she even laughs at my jokes.
1	I trust physicians including mine. I do not think doctors are out to hurt us. I do not think it is likely to have a doctor make a horrible mistake so it is probably best for my health to trust in them. 
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for many years, so I feel that he knows my background and my problems very well. I always feel I can ask questions if I don't understand something. I also find he is very willing to listen to my feelings about taking a medication and he seems to give them some weight in his decisions.
-1	I think has health care been decentralized and doctor are volunteer at places where health care are provided to those who needs it instead of running a business where hospital choose drugs based on relationship with companies and profit margin, and health care industries has become so large in the United States and it seems to be an ever self revolving perpetual growth by keeping the patient close to insurance and trip to hospitals, in other words, when health care is run as a business with insurance and pharmaceutical drug companies making profit, it is hard to discern whether physician's ethics or the paycheck determine the doctor's action.  And given the high health care cost of United States relative to other country when our health and quality of life is not correspondingly as high in ranking relative to spending, I think doctors, hospitals, are interdependent with insurance and pharmaceutical industries in term of making money.  it is kind of like asking someone whether they want to do something that would pay them double or do something that would reduce cost for patients while cutting their paycheck in half, what is the percentage of people do you think would choose the second option, considering doctors are also human
1	My doctor never makes me feel rushed. She always makes sure to answer my questions and make me feel involved in deciding my treatment. She makes it seem like we are a team and equals. She tells me about different types of treatments and recommends what will have less strain on my body. 
-1	I always find that my primary care physician is too busy to give me the time I need. I have gone to appointments countless times and left feeling like I really didn't solve my issues. Sometimes, I even feel that they get annoyed if i ask too many questions and keep them in the room for too long.
-1	I have had surgery in the past where the doctor told me there were two different options on the way he could perform the procedure.  I told him that I highly preferred the one method and didn't want the other at all.  He chose to do it the way I didn't want because it was easier for him.  Sometimes they don't tell you everything either, if they don't think you can handle it. 
1	"I'm sure there are ""bad"" doctors but I have only had positive experiences. They have been attentive and seemed to genuinely care. I also trust their expertise."
-1	My primary care physician doesn't really seem interested in me as a person.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for years and they always seem to be able to fix my problem and seem concerned about my well being.  I have trust that they will continue to fix and help my issues as they arise.
-1	I believe that my doctor is competent, but I sometimes feel like he doesn't take me seriously. I have never been harmed by a doctor, but I feel as though a doctor's convenience is more important to them than my preferences. Overall, I would like to be treated with more respect and dignity.
1	I really like my doctor and have been going to her for several years. However, there was one time when she misdiagnosed a problem I was having. Perhaps part of the problem was the way I described the situation. However, she put me on some medication which, after reading about it, I felt wasn't necessary at all. It turned out the problem was with my teeth and a dentist was the appropriate doctor to fix my problem.
-1	I trust my doctors advice. He would not take the chance of harming. I take his advice and do as he saya.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always been able to treat and cure any ailment that I present to him.  I always wonder if he (or any doctor) is sometimes motivated to recommend treatments that are fincially beneficial to him, however.  I don't believe my doctor has done that with me, but it is always in the back of my mind.
-1	I am moderately trusting of my physician, I'm confident there are some motives behind what she recommends that are not 100% in my best interest and I try to be mindful of that.
-1	"I have a hard time completely trusting him because sometimes it seems like he just doesn't really care. It seems like he's too willing to write off problems that I'm concerned about as ""probably nothing"". This has happened before with health issues that I ended up seeing other doctors/specialists for (even though he was very reluctant to refer me as he didn't think the issues were real/serious), only to have those specialists confirm that an actual treatable problem existed. He also misdiagnosed me once by saying I probably had bipolar disorder and sending me to a psychiatrist without doing any sort of physical exam or lab testing. I spent two years heavily medicated and miserable before a different doctor realized that the root of my problem was physical/hormol and started to treat me for it. And then all my mental symptoms went away. But he's one of the few doctors in my area who take my insurance, so I don't really have the option to have a different primary doctor. And he does know more than I do, obviously, since he went to medical school. It just seems like he's stretched way too thin and misses a lot of stuff."
1	I am not currently in the care of a particular doctor, but all of my experiences, save one horrid anesthesiologist, have been excellent, which certainly says something because, as I said I have had a good handful of this and that over the years.  
-1	I feel like I generally trust most doctors that I have dealt with because I usually do some good research or ask friends on doctors they have had experiences with before making a decision to visit them or not. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is the  one with the knowledge and experience when it comes to medical issues.
1	I think doctors tend to want what is best for their patients. If I ask enough questions and understand things correctly then I can get a sense of the diagnosis. 
-1	Most of the time I do trust them.  I do think sometimes they are running on autopilot.
1	He prescribed medicine that he believed to be helpful, and made sure that I get enough information to use it properly. My doctor cared enough about my condition such that simple follow-up sessions were free. He likes to listen when I ask questions, and makes sure to explain them properly. 
-1	Have been seeing the same doctor for longer than I can remember....knows my entire family
1	My doctor is good because he is older and experienced. He is not overly persoble or chatty, so I don't feel a closeness with him. That is okay to me, as long as he is doing a thorough job. I know he has a lot of patients, so I never feel like I am getting extremely persolized attention, but he is a pro.
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for ten years and, while I haven't always taken his recommendations, I always know why he offers them. I have implicit trust in his judgement and he never fails to take my concerns into account. 
-1	I like my primary care doctor but I don't really see him enough to have perfect trust in him. I see him for maybe 15 minutes once or twice a year. 
-1	I persolly have those feelings towards all physicians as well. I also lean more towards altertive medicine.
1	I will only trust them if I have previously dealt with them. It takes a few visits for me to be able to trust in a doctor. I have encountered some that are only in it for the money and do not care about the patients.
-1	I think that they want to do what is best but I also feel with the insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies around that it is hard for them to always do what might be best for the patient. They try to use universal fixes for everyone and instead of fixing the underlying issue they just prescribe medicine which causes more issues.  
-1	I mainly trust doctors, but I don't doubt that some of them aren't completely honest. At the end of the day, they are getting a paycheck from sick people.
-1	I trust my doctor very much, I am just also the type of person who likes to do my own research before proceeding with any treatment plans. 
1	i trust my doctor because she has always listened and been very helpful when i needed to discuss something. i needed to get my first mammogram last year and had been putting it off. when i saw my doctor she really encouraged me to go and get it done. she wasn't mean or stern. she was very concerned for my well being and wanted me to get the mammogram done to benefit my health. 
1	I have always followed her advice and listened to what she prescribes for me, and I never have an issue. She is smart and very observant. She cares about how she takes care of her patients and she also cares how my other doctors (specialists) are taking care of me.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have no reason to believe that he is dishonest.   I also have not been misdiagnosed in any way.   The only negative is that he is sometimes very busy and does not spend a lot of time with the patient.  The office is also very quick to push people to specialists.
-1	I had a new PCP the last time I visited the doctor. I was not pleased with her performance. I am now awaiting an appointment with a new PCP.
1	I have had the same doctor for many years. He has always been upfront with me and what my options were for that particular ailment.
1	We went to the same high school. She was always a smart and sweet person. By knowing her background I trust her completely. She has always been good when I visit her at the doctor. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor mostly.  I say this because I have a hard time trusting any doctors all of the way.  I have seen many doctors and have had some pretty bad experiences (one telling me that it was all anxiety and then I filly found another doctor who believed me that something was wrong and found the right blood tests to run).  I think I trust them to some extent, but I also rely on what my gut is telling me.
1	I have been with this doctor for over 10 years and no matter what he always treats me with respect and kindness. I have a lot of faults such as my struggle with my weight and depression and bipolar. He gives me options, but does not shame me. 
-1	"I usually have to see a doctor at the E.R. because I have no insurance, so I tend to feel they obviously won't have anything ""persolly invested"" in me as an individual. I think sometimes they just do whatever gets me out of there the fastest, whatever treatment is easiest and quickest. I usually have to remind them to try to keep my lack of income in mind when writing prescriptions and such. This being said, if it is an issue that does not directly involve mental health or drug addiction (these are areas I am knowledgeable about because I have issues relating to these areas), i.e., if it is something I probably don't know much about, I generally trust the doctor because they obviously were smart enough to make it through medical school."
-1	i live in a very small town i broke my wrist and was told it was healed after 3 months wearing a cast it was still broken no one here could properly identify the fracture i drove 3 hours to a specialist did an xray and said so yea your wrist is broken and now it's detioriated since its been so long (i walked around with a broken wrist 5 more months before going to a specialist it was hell) so yea i have no faith in medical professiols especially ones in my small secluded town
-1	I mostly trust my doctor to give me the right advice and do what is best for me rather than just what is more convenient for him. 
1	I trust my doctor because I feel she's always done great with me as a patient. She's thorough, explains anything I don't understand very well, and is just extremely reliable all and all. I trust her because I've had great past experiences with her.
1	I believe in giving my doctor all the information so as to get the best treatment options.  I trust that my doctor has my best interest at heart and feel she would not purposfully give me bad advice.
1	My primary care physician is always monitoring my results from lab tests and amends my medications accordingly. She is thorough and likes to be one step ahead and is calling me instantly when she sees any information she finds troubling.
-1	My doctor and most doctors in general persistently push prescription drugs for every ailment. Any attempt at altertive care is, for the most part, overlooked or brushed off when mentioned. 
1	My doctor is very knowledgeable. On my first visit I kind of tested him by asking a few difficult questions. His answers were beyond my expectations. I have no reservations about trusting him to make wise decisions.
1	I haven't yet run into a doctor that wasn't looking out for my benefit or gave me bad advice. I've heard stories of bad doctors out there who look out for their benefit first, but I've thankfully never ran into one of those doctors myself. Heck, I had surgery a few years back that saved one of my testicles from dying. I think I had something called testicular torsion. Doctor saw what the problem was and gave me the right advice to getting it fixed.
1	Our family has been going to the same doctor for 25 years, we trust him very much. He takes time and explains everything.
1	I have had the same dr for years and she has never steered me wrong. Always disagnosed properly for whatever i came to them for, or gave the correct medicine that healed me for any sickness. My privacy has never been invaded. I trust my doctor
-1	I trust my PCP because she seems intelligent and seems to care about her patients. But I don't completely trust her since she is human and is very busy. She doesn't have time to be extremely thorough and careful.
-1	I like my primary care physician, but I have a certain amount of distrust in doctor's generally and don't trust medications at all. I always prefer to try a drug free option first, and doctor's often aren't on board with that point of view. 
-1	I trust my doctor because all of the things I have gone in for over the past years have been small and mageable. My doctor is friendly and caring even under time constraints and has been candid but kind in regards to things like getting my weight down, etc. I trust that overall he has my best interest in mind. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has always given me good advice. I have never felt the need to get a second opinion. He takes his time and is thorough.
1	I've had the same doctor for most of my adult life. Any issues I've brought up he treated or ran tests to find out what was going on. He's always taken action on anything I brought up and is great at communicating and returning phone calls. I wouldn't extend blanket trust to all doctors just because they are doctors but i would give them the benefit of the doubt
-1	The primary care doctor can't possibly know everything there is to know and keep up with all of the current research. I am also concerned about the conflict of interest between doctors and drug companies. My friend who is a nurse told me she's attended several pharmaceutical company dinners. And the FDA has approved medicines that were upproved years later for being dangerous.
-1	I see an endocrinologist every 3 months. I trust him. He is young and seems to be very knowledgeable in my particular health issue. He is not afraid to try new medications to help me and talks in plain English rather than using unfamiliar medical terminology when talking to me. I trust him and he seems to take more time than most at each appt.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physician for a long time. She always explains everything to me in clear, easy to understand way. She thoroughly explains all the options of treatment and suggests the best one for my needs.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have only had good experiences with them and they always seem to have my best interest in mind. The times that I have had to be given medicine they seem to do a great job of telling me all of the options possible to me and talk with me about the pros and cons of each one. They also seem to be aware of small details that show they have an interest in me. 
-1	"I just feel that the doctors are just following what is on the screen or what the head of their department wants. For example in pregncy they do a ""diabetes blood screen"" at 6 months and they make you drink an aweful glucose gmo drink. Now it has come out there are lots and lots of different options of what to drink or even just doing diabetes testing for a few days/week but still the places go ahead and do it because ""protocol"" or like if you have a csection, they force you to a 2nd one or pay extra money to get one with only a few doctors with waiting lists. It's very stressful to have people just blindly following protocol instead of listening to what you need and want and working for you. "
-1	My doctor is often in a hurry because he has many patients to see. I always trust he uses his best judgement. I think he makes honest decisions.
-1	I have been one of the healthiest people ever, it seems; thus, I do not go to the doctor often. Since I don't need to go to the doctor all that often, it's hard to answer these questions. I do go for check-ups, but haven't gone every single year. I'm now 64 and am trying to go every year or two. But just going to the doctor for something so routine is not quite enough to thoroughly judge a physician's abilities.
-1	I have been pushed around and lied to in the past by doctors. Doctors do not spend enough time getting to know you or your situation before making a diagnosis and are often wrong. Doctors in general are greedy and care more about money than helping people. 
-1	She has shown me that she wants the best for me and my well being
-1	I trust him enough I suppose. He's my oncologist I still see once a year. He's a nice guy and everything but he's always busy so when I go there I do all the tests first (CT scan, blood work, etc.) Then he gets all the information before I see him and if no cancer or nothing new that's pretty much it. Usually only see him for 5 minutes or so. But all in all I'm happy with him, I still go there so he must be ok.
-1	I have taken pre-med courses and have a friend who is a doctor.  Sometimes I think that's why I'm not as blindly confident when it comes to healthcare in general.  Doctor's make mistakes.  It is up to me ultimately to make the decisions about my own healthcare, given a doctor's guidance.
1	I have been seeing this doctor for several years.  He is very professiol, approachable and friendly.  He also has very good reviews from other patients. 
-1	I generally trust doctors as I only see doctors who I have done a lot of research about - to see that they are generally revered in the medical world. I believe if they are that successful and well known, I can trust them. However if it was an ER doctor, I'd be cynical. 
-1	I do feel that they are usually trained to give certain responses. I wish that doctors would take a more holistic approach and give nutritiol support options along with conventiol medicine, and give the patient the option to choose both. 
-1	I trust my doctor. However in the modern world, science is just one more are of Leftist rrative making. I am mindful when researching that doctors and scientists have an agenda which is certainly not truth. For example: Climate Science, Bill Nye, Neil Tyson, when people talk about settled science I laugh at their retardation and misunderstanding.
-1	I believe that the process for becoming a doctor is a long and arduous one.  This makes it a profession in which a larger percentage of the individuals in it are truly committed to their practice.  Being a doctor is an extremely important job and I think the majority of doctors in it truly want what is best for the patient.
1	My primary dr has been my dr for 25 years,  I trust her, I think she is great.  he never hesitates to help me
-1	I trust doctors, if not to know what's best for me all the time, at least to have a much better shot at it than I do. But I don't necessarily trust them to have the same priorities I do. That doesn't even necessarily mean that I don't trust them to put my health as the top priority - sometimes that's not MY top priority. I'm still kind of ticked off at a doctor who ordered $1000 worth of blood tests for PCOS, which it turned out I don't even have and which was nowhere close to his specialty (he was a psychiatrist!). Yes, there was a small chance I had PCOS. Yes, if I had had it, there would have been a small chance of heart problems (all the other symptoms were things I considered either no big deal like hair, or actually beneficial, like amenorrhea and infertility). But good God, $1000! Insurance wouldn't even cover it! I could NOT convince that man that I was poor. So I no longer trust him to make decisions for me, because we don't see eye-to-eye about what's important.
1	I trust my physician because she is very caring, knowledgeable, and understanding. She works with what my medical plan covers and anything I pay out of pocket which takes a lot of stress off my mind. I don't feel like I'm getting ripped off and I'm getting the services required.
-1	I think my doctor is smart and knows what they are doing.
-1	I feel like doctors  have to ear n your trust.  My doctor has not done that as of yet.  Sometimes he speaks to me in a very condescending manner and I just don't like that.  I also feel like he doesn't ask me alot of questions, and just gives me a diagnosis without getting to the meat and potatoes.
1	I see a DO rather than an MD. I really like how current he is on  new issues in medicine. He also is knowledgeable on the body and prefers to prescribe stretches, and lifestyle changes than medication. I like that he is very thorough and really cares for our family.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. Regarding doctors in general, I don't trust them because a lot of them don't seem to care about you as a person, they only look at you as an insurance claim or a cash cow they can keep milking by adding on more tests or prescribing drugs just to get the most money they can from your insurance company or medicaid/medicare.
-1	I feel like all they want to do is make the most money they can so they refer things for no reasons like procedures and medicine
-1	I trust my physicians because he is generally very thorough in our exchanges. He takes the  time to listen to my concerns and will provide me valid answers and options for my treatments.
1	I've been going to my primary care physician since I was a teeger. I've had some medical issues that he's helped me to resolve over the years. He's had his practice for a long time and has never given me a reason to not trust him or his staff.
-1	My experience with doctors has always been that they tend to treat or guess rather than actually putting thought into the process of healthcare. 
1	I trust my physician or doctor because I feel safe with them. 
1	My Dr is a 38 year old female and she's the best Dr I've ever gone to. She is friendly, caring very easy to talk to, has admitted to me that she didn't go into medicine for the money but wanted to help people. I have complete trust in her.
1	My doctor came with high recommendations. After several visits, he is very thorough, asks questions to get a better understanding, and is open.  He makes sure to ask if I understand, if I have any other questions or concerns.  
1	I've seen him several times and he is always candid and straightforward with his opinion, reasons and concerns. I've never had a reason to second guess anything he has told me.
-1	Doctors don't really have enough time to deal with all the solutions that might benefit a patient, so I think the routinize things in a way that I don't trust entirely. For the most part, I do trust their recommendations are genuine and effective, though. 
-1	I trust my doctor most of the time. Sometimes I wish she would show a little more compassion but she is a very busy doctor so I overlook it. There are times I wish she would consider different treatments or at least give a referral. All together I do trust her opinion and judgement. 
1	I feel a general trust in doctors because hopefully they are doing their job to help people. 
-1	For the most part I think my doctors have been thorough and did what was best for me.  I think that many times they are over scheduled and are not able to spend enough time with each patient but I think they do what they can.
1	I've been coming to my doctor for a very long time. Over that time, there has been a lot of trust built and that's hard to come by. She always seems to be concerned about the stability of my health.
-1	My doctor has never or has rarely asked me nor my family about exercise or diet. I know for a fact that these two things are among the greatest things you can do to prevent, reverse, or cure disease. Our doctor only puts my family on drugs and wants them to have expensive surgery.
1	I can't say that I fully trust my doctors. After all, they are getting paid for what they do. I do believe if it came down to the cost of treatments they would choose they one with the highest cost for me.
-1	To many doctors only have book smarts. if  something isnt a  text  book case they dont believe in thinking out side the  box  
1	I trust my doctor because she always makes a point to bond with me and explain her reasoning. I've also been going to the same doctor for four years now and they are completely involved in my family. 
-1	"He is generally there to ""process"" people and get his numbers. If I ask for a prescription for a given issue, he is very willing to write it and move on. Has has some misdiagnoses."
1	I trust my doctor because she explains things thoroughly to me.  We have a good relationship for 15 years.  When I have something that others feel is trivial she listens to me and we discussed.  
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never done any harm to me and always has my best interest at heart. I have to trust that he knows what he is doing as I obviously don't have the training that he does. The only thing that does bother me about my doctor is that he is sometimes too busy for his own good and maybe doesn't take as much time as what he should with patients. I think that his office sometimes schedules too many patients in one day and that is what causes this mind set for me. 
1	I believe that for the most part, doctors have their patient's best interests in mind. I think it is somewhat uncommon for doctors to be more concerned about what is best or more convenient for themselves.
-1	They are in it for the money, prescribing medications instead of recommending more tural vitamins, minerals, foods for diseases. 
-1	It isn't so much that i distrust my Dr. the individual, but rather i distrust the system. The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM. 
-1	I trust doctors in general because most of them are probably good people. I believe they chose to be doctors to take of and help people. However, there are still unethical and potentially dangerous doctors out there. So, I think it is always important to trust your gut when you get the feeling that something isn't right and seek out a second opinion.
1	I trust my doctor because she has been my primary care physician for many years. She has never steered me wrong. I have confidence in her abilities because even though she has been with me for many years, she has been a doctor many years before that. She is very knowledgeable and she is very kind. We know each other well and I trust her completely. I feel very comfortable with her. 
1	i trust them because they are professiols
-1	I have had things happen in the past-(wrong doses prescribed, not listening to serious concerns and misdiagnosis that cost me a lot of heartaches and physical consequences- as a result I am very apprehensive in trusting fully what any doctor tells me. I question everything a doctor tells me and I research my issues. 
-1	I trust the information provided by my doctor. She is very thorough and ensures I do not leave with questions. I sometimes wonder if she doesn't provide me with all the information regarding my health if she deems it irrelevant. I do find myself frustrated with waiting as that does make me seem as it's more to accommodate the doctor vs. the patient. 
-1	i do not know her very well yet
1	I have a high trust with my primary care physician because I have been going to the same physician for a long time. If there is something I do not understand I can ask for more clarity on the matter. Long term relation with my physician have helped me secure my trust in all the things my physician say, and I can tell that my physician cares deeply about me.
-1	I trust her.  I just want to look over anything she prescribes to me
-1	She just appears very genuine. I don't get the slightest hint of anything off about her. I've been seeing her for a few years now, and on more than one occasion, even when she's clearly running behind schedule, she shows no rush to be through with me. She feels like an ally.
-1	My primary care physician does a good job of looking at all the possible treatment options, and talking with me in detail about which option would work best for me.  I think it would be great if they incorporated a more holistic approach to my care and not just looking at the medication treatments.  
-1	My doctor tends to be really straightforward without sugarcoating anything. If I have something wrong with me, then he just says it and tells me how to treat it. 
-1	I think it varies from doctor to doctor. I had one doctor whom was vary vague with me. While I liked her and trusted her, she really didn't give me any additiol info when I was diagnosed with a heart murmur. She knew I was a smoker but didn't suggest any lifestyle changes. My second doctor told me that smoking would make it worse and I should have quit a long time ago. So it's really hard to trust doctors when one will say something and another won't mention other important information that you might want to be aware of.
1	I have a lot of trust in my doctor because he is a close family friend, but I sometimes notice that some of the things he says are a little bit for his convenience.
-1	My primary care physician has been with me for a long time and understands my health best. He seems to genuinely care about his patients which makes it easy to give my trust. 
-1	"i just started seeing my new primary care this year. i have a reasoble amount of trust in her, though i believe most doctors are very traditiol in their methods and i like to know about ""outside the box"" treatments, such as holistic methods. i like to do my own research on the issues i face and often times doctors don't want to hear what ""dr. google"" has to say."
-1	My doctor tends to rush my appointments. She is in and out in less than five minutes, and doesn't really seem to read any of the paperwork I fill out or really take much interest in the concerns I bring to the appointment. Last time, for example, I brought in concerns about my back pain, but she seemed more concerned about my borderline high blood pressue and gave my a referral to a cardiologist.   
-1	"I definitely trust doctors, but ""completely"" is an awfully strong word. Doctors have hundreds of different patients, so don't always have the time to get to know me and my conditions as well as is necessary. While I trust their medical knowledge generally, I am ultimately in charge of my own health. "
-1	 they see a lot more people today and do not develop the rapport they once had
-1	I am very open with my physician so I tend to trust him with most decisions, but it's my body and I want to have the fil say. I believe that all people are inherently selfish, and so I am scared that if I let my guard down, people will take advantage of me. I'm not a trusting person, so even if I agree with my doctor on a major issue, like surgery, I would still want to go to another doctor and get a second opinion, because my health is very important to me. 
-1	I have faith in my doctor and trust her very much. Sometimes I feel that she is a little rushed but all in all she is honest with me and talks with me making me feel at ease.
1	I HAVE CHANGED DOCTORS RECENTLY. HOWEVER, THE PAST FEW MONTHS FOLLOWING HER ADVICE, I HAVE LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND FELT BETTER. ALSO, MY HUSBAND HAS LOST WEIGHT AND HIS DIABETES IS IMPROVING. SO FAR, I THINK I HAVE RECEIVED GOOD ADVICE.
-1	Although I do trust her, there are times that she is so busy, that she barely has time for me. I don't ask questions or tell everything either.
1	My doctor is open and listens to all of my questions and answers them in ways I understand
-1	I trust them, but there are times when they rush things and I'm left wondering if they were caring about me at all.
1	I trust my doctor because she tells me things I don't want to hear. She will also tell me altertive methods to getting better and not just shoving pills down my throat.
-1	I have a general mistrust with doctors in general. I always hear of many problems and mistakes that doctors make and it make me suspicious when they tell me something. I have yet to experience this but hearing other people's story makes me feel like you can never be too careful. I like to get different opinions to make sure what he is telling me is correct.
-1	In general i trust my physician. It's not because I don't trust her that I don't tell her everything, it's because I worry about her thinking I'm being silly and a waste of time.
1	I trust my physician because she gives me all my options and tells me the pros and cons before we do anything.  She is available when I need her for anything and always makes room for me.
1	I do trust my Doctor, I do not think he has ill intentions, and I believe he wishes to provide me with the best care possible.
1	I trust my physician because when i have any doubt he is always there to help me and understand any difficulty that i am going through. H e tells me things more in a friendly way than in a doctor type of serious situation. I completely put all my trust in him and he has given me alot of reasons to trust him.
-1	Doctors don't always give the best advice and many times make the wrong diagnosis. People can fix issues on their own, such as reversing heart disease and such through diet but doctors refuse to accept that despite it being proven countless times. So for reasons such as that, I don't trust doctors in general to do what is best for someone. 
-1	"I am, in fact, in the middle of changing primary care doctors due to a lack of trust and proper ""fit"" persolity wise. She was too authoritarian and didn't listen, brushing off many of my concerns. In general, I find most doctors to be caring, thoughtful individuals, though often very busy. I trust them until they give me a reason for pause, or concern."
-1	I guess I trust him because of familiarity. At first I didn't trust him 100% but after 15 visits or so I've come to rely on his advice since I've seen my health (asthma specifically) has gotten better. Although he's as stoic now as he was on my first visit. Hard man to read. 
1	I have had the same PCP for about 5 years and she has never made me feel rushed and always asks thorough questions about the status of my health. When I have had any problems she made sure to order the appropriate testing.
-1	While I sometimes feel like I'm another patient being flown through the door, and husled along. My doctor usually is very thorough and will sit and discuss anything that I need to talk about.
-1	I have had the same physician for more than 30 years. Also he is the same physician for all my family members.
1	My doctor takes all the time I need him to take to explain everything I want or need to know in great detail.  He respects the fact that I do not like taking pills, and is willing to work with me on lowering my dosages to the minimum effective dose for my condition.  He explains all my options thoroughly, and does not let me leave the office until he is sure I understand them.  He will also squeeze me in immediately if there is a sudden worsening of my condition.  
1	My doctor has always spent the time with me that I need to help me with any issues I have.   I am comfortable with my doctor and his ability to help me.
-1	because he is our family doctor... i know him from a very long time... i know his capacity as a doctor... he is very kind and highly knowledgeable... so i completely trust him...
-1	In general I trust doctors and the science that backs their field. That being said they are human, and for any serious diagnosis I would want an independent second opinion.
1	He has never given me a reason to not trust him, he always explains things in ways i can understand, and usually lets me choose my own options, though he will always let me know what he recommends and why.  He is also very understanding of my issue with when i go to him, i usually try to ask and talk about all my issues at once, which can make meetings last longer then they should.
1	I trust my doctor as he spends all the time I need at every appointment answering questions and explaining all options, side effects and testing results.
-1	My doctor is great.  He doesn't talk down to me because of my GAD and PTSD, and he listens to me.  He has absolutely no problem admitting that he doesn't know everything, and refers me to a specialist for things he feels are out of his field of knowledge.  He's also got common sense.
1	Some doctors are not transparent and they just tell you things without giving you the opportunity to ask them questions and address your concerns. The doctor encourages me to ask questions and tries to clarify my concerns.
-1	My doctor is generally in a rush.  I only see him once a year for a check up so I guess that's good but then I have a year's worth of questions to ask.  I usually get one in and then he's off to the next patient.  He was effective at treating a friend of mine so I guess I should trust him on that basis but there's just not enough time.  
1	He seems to know his stuff and has never disappointed me in the past. His attitude shows that he cares and really takes care of me.
-1	I don't get to go to the best Dr.s My insurance sends me to a clinic. The Haitian men Dr.'s there speak English as a second language. I do not trust them. 
-1	Doctors these days hardly spend any time dealing with you. They tend to rush in and out without taking much time to offer up explations or reasons for what they are doing. It seems that most often it is left up the the nurses or the PA to answer your questions because the doctor has to be doing other things. I also feel like they don't want to give you altertives or other possible options in fear of being sued.
-1	While doctors are educated in their field, they are still human and are capable of making mistakes. Some of them are more interested in their wallet than in you. Some of them have varying degrees of experience. Some of them are just better at specific conditions and not so good at others. Doctors are still just people and suffer the faults of people.
1	I have noticed that she's gone above and beyond when she didn't have to so that makes me very comfortable with her. She also actually listens to what I have to say too instead of brushing me off.
-1	My doctor is set in her old ways. She insists putting me on blood pressure medicine with a diuretic is excellent, but in reality it made me sick,lethargic,dehydrated, and I fainted constantly. In fact, it made my blood pressure too low. Now once again my doctor wants to put me back on the diuretic. She doesn't care what it did to me the last time. I tried to explain to her how it made me feel the last time but she doesn't seem to listen. Also, I have hypothyroidism. It took them 4 years before they took me off synthetic thyroid and put me on NDT thyroid. I had to put my foot down to filly get her to switch me. I'm doing a lot better now I'm on NDT thyroid.
-1	My primary care is a nurse practioner. I don't feel she has the qualifications to deal with the many serious issues I have. Her office is packed, the time with her is very short and she does not answer my most pressing questions.
1	I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE WITH MY CURRENT DOCTOR, AND WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GOOD RAPPORT. WE SPEAK EASILY, FRANKLY, AND OPENLY. I FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST HIM GIVEN OUR HISTORY AND HIS NON-JUDGMNENTAL ATTITUDE AND FRIENDLY TURE. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY REASON TO NOT TRUST HIM, AND FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF HIS REASONS FOR DOING THINGS, HIS EXPLATIONS OF THINGS, AND CONDUCT IN GENERAL. HE NEVER PRETENDS TO KNOW MORE THAN HE DOES, ALWAYS LISTENS, AND I UNDERSTAND OUR INTERACTIONS, MOTIVES, AND COMMUNICATIONS TOTALLY.
-1	I trust my primary doctor because he have treated my diseases for a few years without any significant errors. He treated nicely and friendly. He gave me a lot advice and suggestions on my health condition.  
-1	Conveyor belt care, prescribes drugs my insurance won't cover, just does the very least.
-1	My primary care physicians does her best, but is still just one woman. She does tend to rush, and if what she recommended could drastically alter something going on in my life, I would prefer a second opinion. OR at least a long talk about why she believes this instance/course of action to be the case. People make mistakes, I wouldn't want to be hurt by such an accident.
1	He asks what is bothering me and makes different appointments for different medical problems that I might need to do to better my health.
1	I trust that my physician wants what is best for me, but I think they are also bound to what their organization they work for want and what insurance companies will allow. The organizations and insurance companies are only interested in making money and do not have my best interests in mind and put pressure on Drs to avoid expensive procedures - that can delay needed treatment.
-1	I generally trust doctors to provide a reasobly high level of care with persol integrity. However, I know that as in any field, there are fincial, administrative, and moral/ethical pressures weighing on these professiols. I am sure that sometimes they feel that they must go against their preferred ways of behaving and communicating with patients.
-1	I've never been given a reason not to trust my PCP - Dentists on the other hand: don't trust them!
-1	The physician I had been seeing for the last several years left the area, and I only recently saw a new doctor. I have usually had female doctors in the past, but my new doctor is male. He is also my husband's doctor, and my husband likes him, so I decided to give him a try. I've only seen him once, but we got along very well. He took his time, asked questions and patiently allowed me to ask any questions I had. I liked him but it may take time for me to trust him as much as I did my former physician.
-1	She listens to me. Also I have other family members that go to her and they have gotten wonderful care from her also
-1	The few doctors I had some don't seem to interested. They just ask for symptoms then just prescribe medicine. They feel like their disinterest. Just write a prescription and your done.
1	I am on a persol level with my doc. She knows who I am and what I have been through in life and will get right down to the nuts and bolts of my health so we can work on things together
1	I trust him. He always runs extra tests and checks on me clearly.
1	I am the type of person that will trust a person until they give me a reason to not trust them.  Simply put, my physician has never given me a reason to not trust them. 
1	I completely trust my primary care doctor because I have had the same doctor for over 15 years with no negative experiences or instances.
1	I trust him hes a good man. Very funny. Spends a good amount of time with me. And my health benefits.
-1	Based on his performance and advice throughout the years. I feel confident in his decisions.
-1	My doctor seems to be generally caring and concerned for my well-being. This also seems to be true for her other patients. While I don't always feel like the priority, I do feel as though I am cared for in a proper manner.
-1	Through my husbands insurance (which I have no choice over) I just feel like this set seems not to care to much about the patients.  They seem not to want to listen to me.  For example: when my back was hurt and I could barely walk.  They did an x-ray but they did not see anything on it.  They acted like it was all in my head and that my pain was not real.  I could barely walk for over a month.  I lost trust in my doctors.
-1	My health is more important to me than it is to him.  I have read the results of the 8 year study by Arizo University on chelation.  My physician who offers chelation has not read the results of the study.  Absolute trust would mean that a second opinion is never justified.  My wife just had a bacteria eat away some of her bone below her lower jaw tooth.  Many periodontists would still treat this using bone grafts, while a better treatment using a laser is available.  We selected a periodontist that uses the laser approach.
-1	I trust my physician due to feedback from others I know who also use him. I never see a doctor I have not researched about because there are many out there that should not be practicing medicine. 
-1	My feelings are at a neutral state with my doctor. I feel this way because I believe that  physicians give you some truth but they can also throw in some lies as well. They are money-oriented so therefore they will do whatever they can to get you to spend more money.
-1	I do not always completely trust doctors. On simple diagnoses yes, I do trust them but as far as more complex health issues I would rather get a second opinion as well just to be certain that the diagnosis is correct. 
1	I feel that my primary care physician always listens to me so this has helped build up my trust over the years.  I have always felt she has taken the best path for my medical needs.
-1	I feel that she wants the best for me however, trying different medications with no foreseeable outcome has been rough. She hears me but doesn't give me the drug in which would benefit me most. She has the best intentions in trying the safest method however it seems to be a bit stunted.
-1	I don't know my doctor all that well, but I believe her sincerity, and that she cares about how I am/feel.
1	When I first went to him, I was leaving a Dr that did not take my problems seriously. This Dr. listened, without interruption, to what was happening, asked many questions. He knew exactly what needed to be done to find and fix the problem. He never rushes his patients and always listens to what you're saying.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel like she really listens to me. She is thorough and willing to explore different treatments in order to find the best one for me. I never feel like she is rushing me to move on to other patients.
1	While I do trust my doctor sometimes I worry that she focuses on one aspect of my health while I'm trying to get help for something new that just came up. 
1	I generally trust doctors and believe they have my best interest at heart.
-1	sure about the situation
1	I have known my primary doctor for about a year. In this year, I feel I can trust her to want what is best for me. She is very understanding and allows me to question her and even decide (e.g.) not to take a preventative medicine she has suggested. She makes me feel I am listened to and respected.
1	Some would say that medical professiols can't be trusted most of the time because there are times that they will just neglect your opinion and ask you to follow their opinion for their own benefits.Yes, it is true in some instance.However, those behaviors depending on the person you are in contact with.People now in our society has different attitudes and point of view in life and what is important is we must be cautious.
1	my doctor has always shown compassion and caring for me. im never rushed 
1	My doctor has never lead me wrong. My doctor has always given great advice.
-1	"I am a skeptical person in general.  I feel that for the most part I can trust my doctor, but sometimes people forget that doctors are people too.  I work in a hospital and have heard doctors and nurses talking ""off the record.""  These kind of experiences can really change the way a person views healthcare."
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always makes me feel better.  He gives me exactly what I need to feel better.  He is a nice guy.  I like him.
-1	I do trust my doctor to a large degree. While I am aware they are going to suggest drugs based on their own connections with certain companies.
1	My doctor is up on medical issues and tries to explain everything in a patient-friendly way.  He always goes over all the options and helps me decide based on my needs and desires instead of ordering me to do something.  He is not tied to any particular treatment and is open to different approaches.  He is experienced and not just out of med school, which makes me feel a little more secure--he has seen a lot over the years which gives him a great perspective on what does and doesn't work.
-1	I think they probably had altruistic motives in becoming a doctor.  I think their professiolism dictates that they act properly.  I think they're probably well-educated and intelligent. 
-1	Diagnosing a health issue is not very clear cut. Doctors may give their best guess at what's wrong but may be wrong. Getting an accurate diagnosis can involve a lot of testing, trial and error, or repeat visits. Doctors may take short cuts and prescribe medication based on what is most commonly seen rather than what may be most appropriate in a situation. For example, prescribing antibiotics when presented with generic cold symptoms (which may be caused by a virus).
-1	They work very hard throughout their lives to become doctors. I have much faith and trust in them to stick to their oath. 
-1	Like all professions not all doctors are perfect.
-1	I trust her, I suppose. I was afraid that I had cancer but I really just had canker sores and she gave me a prescription to get rid of them. But she is way too expensive to see!
-1	I basically trust my physician because she was able to help me with an issue that a previous doctor did not attempt to address.  I also feel that she listens to my problems and takes them seriously.  However, due to previous experiences with doctors, I am uble to trust any of them completely. 
1	I trust her because she listens and discusses with me any health issues or concerns I may have. 
-1	I trust my care physician to gather the information he needs to make an informed decision. I trust them to be honest in their assessments and recommendations.  That said I don't always trust that they are giving me every reasoble option and sometimes feel I need to prod for altertives (real Western medicine altertives, not to be confused with altertive-medicine).  Sometimes with prescription recommendations I get concerned over whether I can trust my care physician due shady pharma-reps.
-1	I have experienced negative doctor outcomes with members of my family, including my husband, Mother and Father. I therefore question everyhing when it comes to dealing with doctors. 
-1	I respect and trust in the ability, expertise and intentions of my physician. However, he is still just a person, and no one is infallible.
1	My doctor seems to really want me to understand what problem I have and how to correct/ prevent it.
-1	"As recently as TODAY, May 4, 2017, the US Congress is voting on repealing ""Obama-care"". This whole concept of the free market guiding healthcare is absurd. The US is long overdue to adopting tiolized health. I hate to use this worn out saying but, if the US can put men on the Moon, and now spacecraft to Mars and Pluto, then the US can easily have basic healthcare to cover its' citizens. Doctors are hindered by insurance companies and people have ridiculous expectations as to what healthcare should be."
-1	I feel like there are too many profit based motivating factors with doctors in America that directly work against my best interest. I hear all the time about doctors strongly recommending expensive tests that prove to be unneeded in the eyes of a second opinion. 
-1	He takes time with me, but I think he probably does not try very hard (probably due to dealing with people).  He does not seem to try to find the cause, just treat the symptoms.  I don't distrust him, I just trust my research more.
1	It has always been a very open and honest type of discussion between us. Nothing ever hidden with facts and consequences always fully disclosed.  
1	I haven't experienced a doctor who didn't prioritizes my needs. I know there are doctors that aren't completely honest and are only interested in their pay check, but I don't believe I've ever met one.
-1	Icompletly trust my primary care physician because I have been a patents of his for years 
1	I have been with him for many years and he has always looked out for me. He was instrumental in diagnosing a serious condition that  when corrected completely changed my life. He also makes sure I understand what he says and follows up. I feel lucky to have him as my doctor.
-1	because they try to lie to me that im going to be fine when in reality im not fine....
1	I trust them because they have always been straightforward with me. There is  no reason to question them so I don't.
1	My PCP was researched well enough and my persol interactions have been very professiol. I can find no reasons so far o distrust my PCP, and if I did I would not see this person for anything.
-1	Sometimes doctors aren't up on the latest research. I've had experiences where doctors let their prejudice against me affect the care I've received. Sometimes doctors don't understand how multiple conditions interact with each other. I think that while most of them are well-meaning and generally competent, they're also busy and stressed and sometimes get stuck in their habits. 
1	All of the doctors I've ever met have been extremely calm and thorough with everything. They always go through procedures and explain exactly what they think and what I should do and why I should do it. I trust them very much and have no reason not to. 
-1	I trust my physician because they are more knowledgeable in the heath field than I am and I have to trust because there is no other option.
-1	After speaking with several primary care physicians, I have concluded that this group generally cares deeply about patients and acts in their best interests. I believe doctors make mistakes or seem cold sometimes because of work pressure and empathy fatigue.
1	My doctor has been helping me and my mother for years and has only recommended things in my best interest. If I hadn't moved away from home I would still use her as my main physician.
-1	I just feel like when I visit my doctor or doctors, that I am just another person for them to get  through. I feel that they are always in a rush to get in and out. Its not always because they have other people to see, sometimes it just feels like they are ready to take a break and they rush just to get out. 
-1	I think most doctors are out to help you. There are some money hungry ones who just want to earn as much as possible and do not care much about you, but all in all, I think most doctors generally care about their patients. 
-1	"I trust my physician because he is a trained and qualified professiol. Even if he ""cares more about what is convenient for him than about my medical needs"", I can not know about it. He would not tell me. I can only trust him."
-1	I trust my doctor in a very basic sense. I feel that doctors don't take the time necessary to thoroughly go over medical issues with patients. They are quick to prescribe medications without considering the harm it can do with the side effects. I try to keep up with my own needs and search for medical information to better help me. I feel that I'm the best to look out for myself.
-1	my doctor makes me nervous. sometimes i feel belittled. sometimes i understand things but not fully and do not want to seem dumb so don't ask for examples. 
1	My primary care physician has been giving me care for many years. He is a family friend and has always been competent and attentive to my needs as a patient. 
1	I have gone to him a few times in the past couple years.  He has always been diligent and has diagnosed my conditions correctly each time.  He had to do a couple small procedures which went great.  I have gotten better each time and have had no complications when recovering.  He has done a fantastic job.  Takes the time to make sure he knows what is wrong and goes over everything I need to know and answers my questions.
-1	Because you asked about my GP, I usually see him when it's about something specific. Generally he listens, performs a few simple, superficial tests and then refers me to a specialist.
-1	Doctors do not respect the moral or philosophical views which differ from their own regarding treatment. They treat symptoms and not underlying causes of illness and they do this by pushing medications that cause more harm and side effects to the body, thereby increasing the problems (and the number of medications) that one must battle.
1	I've gone to the same doctor for the past 20 years so I have a decent relationship with him. While I don't go to the doctor often, I know if I do need to that he'll be honest and up front with me. He knows me and is interested in helping me.
1	I believe my doctor is competent and knowledgable.  She has specialized training, so I often defer to her.  She is always professiol, and I trust the hospital she works for.  She is a good person who genuinely seems interested in promoting my health and well being.
-1	Although I'm sure he gives great information, I have a feeling that most doctors as well as my own throw out information in order to benefit themselves. Better feedback means more clients, etc. I feel like most solutions to my problems are a bit forced and not genuine.
1	I've only been seeing my doctor for about 6 months, but so far he has helped my take care of my health needs by referring me to specialists and prescribing medication which has helped me. He has also ordered tests to make sure nothing is wrong with me. He talks to me like a person and not just a patient, he understands my needs an listens to what I have to say.
-1	some times i can trust doctors but not all the time some times doctors advice go wrong because if we cant explain our doctprs how he can guide us. many times we never know our situation so how can we trust them in all casses.
-1	I feel my doctor is rather caring about my medical needs. He tries his best to cover all bases when an issue comes about to elimite any possibilities of what the issue can be causing any underlying illness.
1	I have been going to this same doctor for several years; I feel she knows me well. She considers my emotiol status as well as my physical status to determine the best course of treatment for me.
-1	I trust somewhat because of professiol training but sometimes I feel like they have so much on their shoulders that they might just write off some of my concerns and think of the first thing that comes on their mind to solve my problem so they can get to the next patient
-1	He has actually listened and seem more concerned than most doctors I have had in the past. I trust him, to an extent, because he seems to listen and try to figure out the best action to take, but since I have had testing on things that were expensive and still had no resolution and he seems to not have as much experience as others, I do not completely trust him.
1	I've known my family doctor for a very long time and trust him on a persol level in addition to a professiol one.
-1	I don't have one but the ones I had in the past do not fit the category of fully trusted.  
1	Been my doctor for a long time. Family and friends have gone to him for 15+ years. He is very smart and knowledgeable. He has never told me anything that was wrong or iccurate. He is also the head doctor for the hospital next to his practice. 
-1	I do trust them, but I want to be informed as it is my body, and I want to agree with everything that is done to it, or put a stop if I am not. 
-1	I trust doctors in general, but they are human and can make mistakes. And then there are some who are not very good at what they do. My trust is conditiol.
-1	There hasn't be a major illness I've had to deal with in my life or my family members life.
-1	I think there is a mindset is medicine today that you need to get the patient in and out quickly. You have to consider what insurance will pay for when running tests. Doctors rarely get to know you well enough to have a complete understanding of your life and finding out what underlying causes may be contributing to what's wrong with you.
-1	My doctor takes time to talk with me and answer all my questions. There is also time to discuss all options thoroughly to gain the clearest picture.
-1	ALL DOCTORS WANT IS MONEY
1	My doctor is a candid, relaxed older gentleman who seems to always say exactly what he means. He has never given me the impression that he's in a hurry to see other patients, or that he wants to quickly diagnose me. He's put me through thorough tests, asked me a lot of questions, and suggested many options to me.  The fact that he's so thorough and patient makes me completely trust him to act in my best interests.
-1	I don't have a primary doctor but I do feel that most doctors that I have dealt with of very trustworthy. I haven't had any issues of being mislead of being misinformed over any medical situation. Most doctors I have dealt with seem sincere and show concern. 
-1	I have always trusted my doctor.  He has been my persol doctor ever since I had my first heart attack.  I can say I do not trust his nurses due to their ruse behavior, but my doctor yes.  He has done persol visits to my home before and has taken good care of my health after my first heart attack experience.  I feel much better now than before. 
1	I think for the most part doctors are persoble and want to help their patients. Doctors are generally fairly nice to their patients and want to find the best care practice for them.
-1	i always follow  our   family doctor because he is updated the lated treatment and medicines etc
-1	In regard's to doctor's in general, I have a lack of trust of doctor's for the reason that I have had multiple friend's and loved one's die from cancer. Cancer is a business in this country and patient's with cancer are not told the complete truth when it comes to treating cancer.
1	I trust my doctor because he if very thorough and explains things well. He is very caring and takes time out at the beginning of my visit to ask about my life and family. He never rushes his patients and takes a good amount of time with them.
-1	My primary care physician does not care to fully diagnose me or most of his patients for that matter. He will do a series of tests or ask questions to get a general idea of what may be wrong, and will then prescribe antibiotics, painkillers, etc. without even confirming I actually need the medicine.
1	I have used the same clinic for 20 years and even though there have been times when they have had to try different treatments to figure out what works I have always felt that they have had my best interest in mind. Sometimes they will start with a treatment that cost the least in order to help me out fincially so that I do not have to spend excess money on test and prescriptions. They have always seemed to be upfront and honest with me and other members of my family.
-1	I've been seeing my doctor for a long time and he hasn't ever really steered me wrong, but I also haven't really ever dealt with any serious health problems. I have family members who have stopped seeing this doctor because they thought he wasn't taking the time necessary to deal with their conditions, but until that happens to me or if I have a condition I don't think he can handle I will continue to see him.
1	I have never had any problems with my primary care physician. He is very experienced, wise , efficient and considerate. 
-1	My feeling towards them stem from a simply fact they only want there money. They provide only temporally fix to the issue just so you visit them again.
-1	I trust my doctor's abilities and believe him to be honest. That being said, he has hundreds of patients and I'm not his friend or family member. I'm sure he does a great job, but why should I have complete trust in another person, just because they are my doctor. I don't have complete trust in my friends or family members, why should my doctor be any different? 
1	I tend to trust my physical because he feels like he is knowledgeable. He also doesn't seem like someone who rushes through patients. He takes the time to answer any questions I might have. He seems to care.
1	I have been a patient with my doctor for a while.  I have a good rapport with him.  He is thorough and follows up well.  He explains things well and answers any questions.  I trust his judgement and opinion.
1	MY PHYISICIAN IS GOD FEARING
1	My doctor is calm and collected and very sympathetic. She seems to care about me as a patient so I trust her.
-1	I would trust my primary car physician because it is a doctor that you regularly see and they know you and your health. they will know if something is wrong.
-1	I trust her because she is very professiol and through with everything. I have had her for several years and always glad to see her
1	My PCP is very mellow and always has a calm demeanor when engaging with me. He asks questions, is not judgmental when hearing my responses, and often makes suggestions about types of treatment even when I am always willing to go with whatever he recommends first. He has never rushed me during our meetings and I never felt that he saw me as just another patient or that he only saw his profession as just work; he seems to genuinely care about all his clients.
-1	I trust physicians, however sometimes I believe they are too busy to fully disclose all options for medial treatments and typically provide the fastest answers as possible. Sometimes I feel like physicians could be a little more thourough, but there's only so much they can do with the time they're allotted, especially with large work loads/multiple patients.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he will tell me that I'm doing something wrong. For example, my blood sugars were elevated and he told me directly that if I don't cut down my candy consumption, he will not see me as a patient anymore. He really cares for my health and not only that but explains things in real context.
1	With one notable exception, all the doctors that I have dealt with have been professiol, if a bit brusque. For the most part though, I've never gotten any bad advice or diagnosis, so I can't really complain about the bedside manner if they tend to do the job well.
1	she is my age and is very intelignet She is going throght some of the same issues I am and i just connect with her so much and trust her a lot she is  a contol freak but i love it anyway its good for me!!
1	I have never been given any reason not to trust my Doctor. He has always been able to provide the level of care that I expect and always answers my questions satisfactorily 
-1	My doctor seems sincere in his concern for my problems. He typically lays out what I need to know about my condition. He seems to make as much time for me as possible despite seeming like he is always busy.
-1	Because it would lead towards others not being truthful with their things
-1	My doctor is very knowledgeable and thorough but I still feel more comfortable researching and getting second opinions. I don't trust anyone blindly. 
-1	There are two levels of trust I have for a person who is providing me a service. The trust of them as a person and the trust in the service they're providing. I trust must doctors as good people, but that doesn't mean they can't make mistakes or not be adequately informed about something. I may rely on a doctor, but that doesn't mean I trust him or her 100%.
1	Well I have known him for a long time and he is a good guy. He has never made a serious mistake in regards to helping me so I have great trust in him. He is also always quite nice. 
1	I have gone to the same primary care physician for the past twenty years.  He has always been patient, upfront, and honest with me.  He has never given me a reason to second guess his intentions or information. 
1	He is a board certified doctor. He has over 40 years experience in the field. 
-1	I am kind of in the middle on this. I neither trust or distrust. I believe that my doctor might not be able to devote as much time to my health as is necessary to make the best health decisions possible. 
1	I love my doctor!  I started seeing him several years ago because of some mild but confusing symptoms a GP thought needed special attention from an endocrinologist.  My mom had been seeing this doctor- Dr. Marcus- for some time before, so I had a good recommendation.  Dr. Marcus is very kind, very thorough, and an impression diagnostician.  He was able to guess at possible causes for what seemed like very strange symptoms and had me take various tests to confirm things and rrow down the possibilities.  He always answers all my questions and believes strongly in preventative medicine.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very knowledgeable and open.  She tells me why she makes a diagnosis.  She gives me time to ask questions.
1	He's always been upfront with me and has given me multiple ways to go about a situation. 
1	I trust my doctor to treat what symptoms I have explained to him but sometimes I do not know how to explain my symptoms and will have to make a couple of trips to the doctor's office to get the correct diagnosis. 
1	I trust my primary care because I believe that he really cares for my well-being.
1	Overall, I trust my physician.  He is professiol, courteous, and always patient in answering my questions.  He is also prompt and ready, when I set an appointment with him.  He is also open-minded and discuss various options and aspects about my health.
-1	I have a friend who highly distrusts most doctors due to her extensive experience with them, and I trust her judgements about things. However, I have seen nothing strange from my own doctor. 
1	They always take their time, aren't rushed and explain to me any test results.  They have a conversation with me rather than just reporting things.  They have a genial and relaxed manner.
-1	I have a good doctor.  In most things I trust what she says.  However I am responsible for my own care and if something seems risky it is best to get more information on it first.  I try to avoid taking a lot of medications that has bad side effects.  
-1	My physician is extremely busy and usually seems preoccupied by something. I live in a rural area and patients are often seen by assistants and students rather than the physician. I am concerned that local practitioners are not up-to-date with current findings. Medicine here seems to consist of ibuprofen, Gatorade and Jesus.
1	My doctor listens to me and thinks about what to do often if he can not figure things out he will send me to a specialist.
-1	I know they get kickbacks for prescribing certain medications from companies and so they do in fact go out of their way to prescribe them when the might not be the best medication for the ailment or might even be harmful or just plain not need medication at all.  The can put their bottom line first which is never good for the patient.  This is not always the case of course but it happens way more than it should (of course it should never happen at all)
-1	"My primary care physician treats me with respect and understanding. He has great ""bedside manners"". He always listens to my needs, likes, and dislikes. "
-1	My husband and I moved to a new state and we didn't know anything about a Primary Care Physician, so we looked up who seemed to be best in this town.  The doctor was not taking on new patients, but there was another doctor in his practice.  This doctor who I just mentioned is awful!  He barely seems to care when I have an issue and need his help.  We are currently looking for a new PCP and are getting ideas from others who we trust.  Also, our previous PCP where we used to live was AMAZING!  She took her time, asked questions and made sure that I was cared for!  That just makes this new PCP so much worse!
-1	I don't see the doctor frequently enough for them to know me or my health, so it'd be difficult for them to be particularly insightful. They are usually behind and seem very rushed. They don't really examine me or ask questions. They'll look at the part pertinent to the complaint that prompted the visit and prescribe the treatment I would have guessed I needed before I went in.
1	My doctor always takes the time to explore the best treatment options. He explains them in a manner that is easy to understand, the benefits and downsides of procedures, and how I should go about certain routines. He does not make me feel pressured, does not force decisions on me, and makes sure I complete agree with something before moving forward. 
-1	I don't know them well; we're on insurance and don't get top notch treatment, and I don't know the doctors well enough to know how objective they are.
-1	My doctor asks questions to be sure he is treating me effectively.  He listens without judgment (as I have encountered with another doctor) and he doesn't make me feel belittled.  
-1	I trust my physician because I don't feel like he's trying to oversell me to get more from my insurance. His answers and explations are quite clear. 
-1	I have been repeatedly misdiagnosed and handed pharmaceuticals that only mask the symptoms, not treat the problem. The doctors often seem so preoccupied with getting to their next patient that they don't care to take the time to properly resolve my ailment(s).
-1	I'm not very trusting of him, because he shows no concern or care for the problem he is treating. His main focus is money, and when he recommends a treatment or medication, I need to go and research it myself to make sure it is even a viable option. He has suggested some options that are laughable at best.
-1	When I've gone to my physician or even one at an emergency care facility they often try to rush you and generalize what is going on. This would be when you explain symptoms and you say you've had a bad cough for three weeks and they just blow you off and tell you there is a cold going around and when you end up in an emergency room you find out you had a bacterial infection in your lungs. Its hard to trust them as it's a business now and they move people in and out like cattle. If you're lucky your Dr will spend 5 minutes with you but the nurses usually do all the interview work.
1	He is a good doctor and has always given me the best care possible. He is always willing to see me on a last minute basis if I need to come in. 
1	My doctor is very truthful to me and she always tells me exactly what I want to hear, which is the truth. She is very qualified and I consider her one of the best doctors in the area.
1	I don't know.  I am not going to put a whole lot of though into why I trust my doctor.  I suppose, if he had ever given me any reason not to trust him, he would not be my doctor any more.
1	I've been with my Doctor now for almost a decade and I've had little or no reason not to trust he has my best interests at heart. He only prescribes drugs when I really need them and gives me more than one option for treatment with full information.
-1	Most time my health got recover after seem them.  Their got high degree and was well  train. 
-1	Yes I trust my physician. I generally trust most people unless they give me a reason not to.
-1	I don't like or trust her, she comes in looks at my chart prescribes another pill and walks out without hardly talking to me.
-1	The body is meant to heal itself give the proper environment. I don't think taking chemicals and drugs are the way to make that happen. A lot of allopathic doctors don't want to acknowledge tural altertive treatments for their patients because they are being paid by big Pharma to solicit their drugs.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician.  I think doctors in general, such as the doctors I've gone to in the past, want to get you out of there as quickly as possible so they want to avoid finding out anything more about a situation or saying anything specific to the individual and not generic.  I generally don't think doctors have taken me seriously.
-1	Doctors are humans too and sometimes they might be limited or bound by other things like insurance, law (like they can't insist/suggest rather strongly on doing something when you don't want to) etc. Doctors can make mistake and that's why you always need your second opinion (or even third sometimes).
1	The doctor always takes their time when dealing with me and he doesn't feel likes he is in a hurry. He explains every thing that I need to know and ask me if I have any questions. He makes always has me come back for a check up when I get medicine that I need to see if it is working like it supposed to. I do trust my doctor to act on my interests.
-1	"I don't care how much of an expert any doctor is, you should never trust any one completely. If you want to be healthy then you need to be actively involved, not just relying on someone else for all the answers. So, while I do have great confidence in my doctor, I don't take everything he says as ""the gospel"". I'm not at all above obtaining a second or even third opinion on an issue that I'm still not certain about. At the end of the day, I see it as a 50/50 relationship between doctors and myself...in order to achieve optimal results we both have to do our part."
-1	I like my new primary care doc very much but had really negative experiences with docs for way too long when I lived in another state. I am extremely cautious about all medications and am generally skeptical so I do my due diligence with all doctors and treatments they recommend. Right now I am dealing with some significant side effects from meds Rx'd in the late '90s and at that time absolutely no one told me the long term effects until a dentist did years afterward. So although I like my current pcp, I don't let down my guard and just accept everything they say as the complete story.
1	My doctor gives me no reason not to trust them. They always make time for me even when they are busy. The health of their patients is their number one priority. 
-1	the doctor i used to see,seemed to just want to prescribe more pills.even though the previous prescription didnt help.almost like he was guessing.
1	I usually have been healthy so my doctor visits are really short but If there is a problem my doctor is right on top of it and either gets me help or helps me right away by getting me an appointment with the appropriate physician.
1	I trust my doctors because they help me get what I need for my kids and make sure they are healthy.
-1	I don't have complete trust in them.  They are so busy and trying so hard to get patients in and out I don't feel they totally are dedicated to providing me with the best care. 
-1	been my family doctor for a long time not just me but friends and family and has alway do their job well
-1	I believe if a person has dedicated their life to healing people, then their suggestions would be valuable. Doctors have a lot invested (time/money) in their careers, I don't believe they would throw that investment away by providing false information to their patients.
1	I can relate to my doctor with some challenges that we've faced with our kids.  He is my son's doctor also (Family Practice). He gets it.  He is very professiol but could not hide his frustration with the school system for special needs children.  It really helped me to not feel alone especially with a doctor who is so understanding.  He has such a good bedside manner.  He really does care about my son and I as his patients.  I truly feel that he gives his best advice and I would trust him with any health concern that I have.
-1	I sometimes get the feeling the doctor is thinking more about what the insurance company will pay for rather that what is best.
1	The doctor always explains the medical problem in detail, and doesn't assume you know what he is talking about.  He thoroughly answers all my questions about the problem or the options.
1	They have been with me since I was young and have built a reputation 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have known her for a long time and she always have time to see me and my family in case of any emergency. She is always honest and straight forward about my medical issues.
-1	I trust my doctor and their diagnosis because I feel that they take the time to listen to my symptoms.  They also take time to evaluate my problem areas and run the necessary test to get a proper diagnosis.
1	I trust my doctor to give me the best treatment options. That the doctor's job after all, to help me feel better. 
-1	I have only seen my new primary care doctor once.  She was thorough in her questions and seemed very involved in my health care with recommendations for action and followup.  (Of interest, I had also seen a dermatologist about the same time... that physician/assistant seemed to actually be grossed out by me and responded with a lot of 'i really dont know what to tell you' and with no recommended treatment, and the clinic calling me with the wrong information only to have to call me back and tell me they made a mistake.)   Truly, I think going to the doctor is a crap shoot as to whether or not you will get someone that cares and doesn't treat you like someone they just need to move through the system.
1	if you cant trust you doctor who can you trust i trust him because he took an oath and is in the service buseiness the buseinss of caring adn heping
1	My doctor is very forthright and honest, they give me the information that I need to know and will give me ideas on what I can honestly do to help make myself healthier or achieve my goals.
-1	Most doctors care more about cost than patient care.
1	I have been seeing this doctor for over 12 years and he has always been honest with me. I know my welfare is his top concern and he has always taken very good care of me and health issues that may arise.
-1	I do trust my doctor.  I have been seeing the same doctor for about 15 years and I know him very well.  He always has my best interest in mind.
1	Doctors are in a profession to heal people so I would think that in general that they would care about people. And I'd trust them because I think that they want to give the best treatment either due to common human decency or pride in one's profession to do the best work.
1	I have been with my primary care physician for a long period of time.  I have gained a healthy relationship and trust level with her. She has always giving me straight-forward advice and information. Whenever I've asked of side effects or possible outcomes she has always giving me the knowledge and confidence the positive effect greatly out way the negative.
-1	My doctor is pretty old, and set in his ways. I haven't been to him that many times since I moved here, but the times that I have been to him he was not that great. He seemed to rush through appointments, not spending much time with me. The information he gave me about an issue I had seemed pretty outdated, so I didn't take his advice on that. I have been meaning to find another primary caregiver, but I have not found the time to do it yet.
-1	I trust doctors I general to a degree, but often I think they are too overbooked to provide the attention most patients need or would like. I think they check symptoms, provide a diagnosis, and a treatment plan, but don't stick around to fully answer patients questions. I feel like a wait around for the doctor and then am rushed once they arrive.
1	My current PCP is much better than some I've had in the past. She is still hurried at times due to her full office visit schedule, but does her best to spend all the available time productively. She uses electronic communication when possible to continue conversations. This is a great improvement over past doctors who have listened to one or two symptoms, fired off a prescription, and hurried out.
1	I have had nothing but good experiences with my doctor. I always got the feeling that they really care about my health and what is best for me.
-1	Doctors are always trying to get you to take medications that don't really cure the condition. Their priorities are to the pharmaceutical company and not to the patient. They are not in the business of trying to get people well, just getting patients to take medicines to mage the illness.
1	I trust my PC because I have been with him for years. He has no steered me wrong in all the years that I have known him.
1	My doctor tell me like it is ,he always tell me if im doing good are bad. and will call and see how im doing on the meds and to make sure im taking them the way he wants me to,
1	My doctor has gained my trust within the past year by discovering a serious problem with my thyroid in the process of examining me for rhumatism. I would not have known this if he had not taken the trouble to examine my blood tests carefully and sent me for more specific tests. This process has definitely made me trust his competence and thoroughness.
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me what is happening without sugar coating it and I really appreciate that.
1	I think he is mostly trustworthy and competent.
-1	I feel that physicians are highly qualified, of course more so that me, with the knowledge on medical issues. A PCP knows you and there is trust in that
1	"I trust pcp a lot. She has been my doctor for several years and she has been great. She knows me well and works with me to help me mage my health problems. I'm not ""just another number"" with her. "
1	I believe that doctors in general have their patients needs first in mind, but I also feel like they are over worked and over stressed. They also don't necessarily have all the answers, and have to solve some problems through trail and error.
1	My primary care doctor has given me no reason to distrust them, so I trust them. The Hippocratic Oath and medical licensing process are enough for me to trust them so long as they don't give me reason not to.
-1	I don't put too much trust in my doctor and I always research the pills he prescribes me. The reason for this is that I know a lot of big companies offer money to doctors so they prescribe their pills. I've seen few documentaries about it.
-1	I really have little experience with my primary physician, one incident that stands out is her interpretation of an x-ray when I injured my ankle.  Upon viewing it she decided that there was no fracture, when we looked at it together I thought there looked to be a small fracture - she insisted that what I saw was a vein.  Later that evening I received a call from the radiologist who had reviewed my x-rays and he confirmed that there was a fracture.
1	I trust my doctor.  She never seems to be too busy or distracted to answer my questions.  She is not arrogant some some doctors I have know.  She asks a number of questions about how I am feeling.  She responds very persollybout any medical tests or lab work that I have done.
-1	I'd like to trust my doctor more. The issue is that he sees so many patients I often feel like a number. He gets in a rush during appointments. I trust him as far as I can, but I'd prefer to have a doctor that could give me more individualized attention. Sadly that isn't an option for me at this time.
-1	Because with them I feel very safe
-1	I feel I can trust my doctor because he is very professiol. He seems to care about his patients. He also explains things well.
1	I don't have a PCP but I consider my OBGyn my most regular doctor. She is very smart, compassiote, and takes time to explain things to me clearly and give me advice and recommendations. I like her and trust her a lot. 
-1	Having known a number of doctors, I know that they are human like the rest of us, and make mistakes like the rest of us. I also know that many are over worked and will sometimes rush a patient through his appointment. Others seem to care more for their bank accounts than their patients. And still others are hemmed in by rules and regulations where they work to really provide honest opinion. So no, I don't completely trust any doctor.
-1	If you can't trust your Doctor, who can you trust? Even if you have some misgivings, it doesn't hurt to go get a second or even third opinion to allay some of your fears. It's not like Doctor's really have an incentive to lie to their own patients.
-1	I had to switch plans and have no history with this doctor. His entire knowledge of me is post traumatic times. He doesn't know when I was healthy enogh to do normal things but i look perfectly fine. I describe chronic issues that I think he considers whiny or malingering. He is only my doctor because I can access his location the easiest. He seems to be a doctor who prefers wealthy clients. That being said he did I.D. one condition that others had missed or advocated wild treatments for. That is the basis of the level of trust I DO have in him.
-1	I think that doctors are people to so they can make errors.  I trust my doctor but still use apps such as WebMD so I can get a sense of what might be the problem before going to the doctor.
-1	Most of them are paid to push certain drugs on me.  I have a condition that through many doctors, i am uble to ever have two of them agree about it.  I constantly get conflicting info about it.
-1	Doctors generally have other considerations besides a patient's optimal treatment. They can be fincially influenced by pharmaceutical organizations and recommend newer and different medications. They can also be driven by profits when recommending procedures that may not be necessary. They also may avoid certain treatments because they do not have the knowledge to recommend them, or they may want to avoid liability. 
-1	I currently do not have a primary care physician for the simple fact that I can't find one who is willing to look past their training and realize that not everybody is an identical copy of another. Most of the ones I have encountered are medicine pushers. For those who can't, or would rather not take traditiol forms of western medicine, finding a doctor who believes or takes you seriously is a very difficult task. 
1	I have been with my doctor 3 years. He spends more than enough time going through things he thinks I should know. He answers my questions and will explain them where I can understand. I am able to email him with questions and he or his nurse will respond within a day. I receive updates on my health and tests. If he feels I need additiol tests done, he or his nurse will email or call me directly and explain why. 
1	I've been lucky enough to have a female doctor who understands my female health related issues.  I trust this person for the most part.  I understand that people are not perfect.  
-1	I have never really had an experience where I totally trusted a doctor. I usually go for annual physical exams and it doesn't seem like they really check all the things they should be checking. I think they have a routine to go through and there's very little else above that.  
1	My primary care physician has always had my best interest in mind.  He is always willing to answer my questions or concerns regardless of time.  I feel we have a good relationship and can count on him to provide the best health care. 
-1	I do not necessarily distrust my physician I simply don't completely trust anyone. I value my doctors opinions and suggestions greatly but ultimately I make my own decisions. 
-1	I don't have a primary care right now but my specialist that treats me has always been trustworthy and is a very pleasant doctor to deal with.
1	My doctor is very persoble and doesn't talk down to you when he explains things. I have been lucky enough to not have any serious health issues in a long time, so I don't really have any reason to distrust him. He's never given me anything that I'd call bad advice, and he did give me some useful info about the tension headaches that I get now and then.
-1	I dont trust anyone to  be honest but i would hope doctors can be trusted to do what is in the best interest for my health 
1	Honestly, my doctor is from my community and i have this doctor as our family doctor since last 7 years. From the experience my doctor is being honest about our health condition.
-1	overall I think doctors are trust worthy but there are a few sketchy doctors out there and that makes people not want to trust any of them. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never failed to solve my problems, he has always done his best to find the best solutions for me.
-1	I don't fully trust any doctor. Any person can make a mistake. Also you never know how a person really is and how much they really care.
-1	 I think my pcp is honest about the treatments she is aware of, but being a general practitioner she has to rely on specialists for certain conditions. I trust her decision in treatment unless I have found other information that needs to be discussed first.
1	I trust doctors because when I do have to see them they are always willing to answer all of my question. I have not had any issues with a doctor not spending enough time with me to makes sure I understand all the options available to me. I haven't had a doctor make a poor decision in my healthcare.
-1	I have a primary care doctor.  Sometimes he does not seem as thorough as he could be in medical checkups.  Or he keeps wanting to send me to specialists for things he could do himself
-1	I don't fully trust my doctor because sometimes I feel he just wants to get me in and out and like he doesn't take much time asking me questions. I have to always tell him I have some questions so he answers them, rather than him asking me if I  have any questions or concerns.
-1	Majority doctors are trustworthy but i feel that some can't be bothered much. Just looking for there persol benefits. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because i believe him.
1	My doctor is very good at his job. He's also very honest with me. He works hard to help me stay healthy no matter how much work it is for him. That is why I trust him completely. 
-1	I think doctors are doing their best according to their training. Few have any training or knowledge about altertive or tural remedies. I wish they did. 
-1	 Again, I'm sure overall my doctor is a good physician,  but i feel like if my opinion does not match with his,  it becomes a battle of wills rather than a helpful exchange.  And of course I don't always get as much time as I would like with him,  but more with the nurse,  which makes it seem I funny really matter to him. 
-1	I don't put complete trust in no one. That goes for doctors too. Everybody are human, and their well-being, opinions and feelings can affect my medical treatment.
-1	anyone who has spoken to a health professiol knows they don't know everything. more often than not, they have no opinion about some new drug or treatment you are going to ask them about because in fact, you have done more recent research and are probably talking about something that has yet to be in widespread use. they will rely on things that have worked in the past and give the same answers they always give rather than go out of their way. speaking for myself, I don't have a regular routine so I may never see them again and they know it
1	My primary care physician takes the time to fully explain things to me, because she knows I want to know what I am taking. She never rushes me. She never tries to give me medicine that she knows won't work just because she is getting a kickback from the company. She doesn't over-medicate patients, only prescribing medicine if she really believes I need it. The only times I distrust her is when we disagree on a course of action. But the fact that she allows me to disagree, and talk it over with her makes me trust her more. 
1	I trust my doctor to provide me with the best care that is in the scope of his capability.  If I have a problem that is outside the scope of his responsibility I trust him to recommend another competent person.
-1	My experiences with doctors in general has been extremely negative.I once broke my ankle and the medical staff wanted to amputate.I refused treatment got a second opinion,had surgery and now walk fine.I had an infection from stepping on a il.The doctor said I would die if I didnt go through a horrific procedure.I refused treatment again and am still alive and healthy.I find most doctors lack the proper skills to diagnose and treat medical problems and have lost faith in the system.If I had trusted the doctors I dealt with in the past I would be in terrible shape.Im glad I was brave enough to stand up to these individuals who are trusted with peoples lives and health and find the proposition of consulting with a doctor as scary and unreliable.
-1	At the moment I don't have a primary care physician so I am answering based on my previous doctors and the many doctors I have taken my parents to.  I believe all these doctors are trying to be responsible and do their best.  But primary care physicians are much too quick to prescribe a pill or CHANGE medication based on one reading in their office (especially for blood pressure). I honestly don't believe some doctors understand that 'more' or a drug is not necessarily better. I don't think doctors have much time (or take much time) to problem solve these days.  I think they often make sp judgements based on how much your symptom looks or sounds like somebody else's rather than assuming your symptom might be unique.
-1	I do not trust doctors in general because I believe they are trained to treat symptoms and not to get to the root of the problem, which, is often related to lifestyle or environment. I feel that sickness is very politically fraught, and that a doctor who was truly honoring the Hippocratic Oath would be obligated to be politically active and to advocate for improved environmental and economic conditions for the poor. Essentially, I feel that doctors and the medical establishment have a vested interest in maintaining people in a state if illness which requires ongoing treatment, rather than helping people become optimally healthy and teaching them how to improve and maintain their own health. 
-1	Having a myriad of experiences with physicians as a result of my background, I can say with absolutely certainty that physicians are predisposed to engaging in bad behavior and ebled by society's misconception of all physicians as a group as being compassiote, competent, ethical, trustworthy etc. Having seen shockingly horrifying and abhorrent displays of bad behavior by physicians, there is no way I have any trust in physicians as a group as they are one of the most self-serving, selfish, manipulative, and uncaring people I have come across. This is not to say that all physicians are like this, however, it is important that people drop their false notion of physicians being equivalent to saints so that patients are better equipped to deal with wily, deceptive physicians and are more motivated to be active when seeking healthcare/engaging with physicians. 
-1	i think doctors have a general sense of care about the patient that over exceeds any kind of selfishness they may have 
-1	I have always had a good experience with my PCP. She's about my age, which makes me sometimes wish that she had a bit more experience. She always listens to what I have to say although sometimes I feel like she is a bit rushed and just wants to wrap up the appointment. I've never had anything serious come up that she had to treat me for. 
-1	Most doctors listen to patient concerns.  
1	My primary doctor has been my doctor for almost 10 years. She is the most caring, loving and thoughtful doctor I have encountered. 
-1	I have trust in my physician because they usually provide the right details for me and they thoroughly look into why I feel sick or whatever it may be. I trust their information and they rely to me the appropriate things I need to recover. Reason I put faith in them is because every time I went to them for help, they did their job well. 
1	I feel my doctor (or nurse practitioner) has my best interests in mind because she is always thorough and helpful when we meet with her.  She listens and troubleshoots any issues we have. 
-1	"In general, when dealing with a physician, I find that they are blatantly unconcerned with the welfare of their patients up to the point at which they have concerns about legal liability. The vast majority of physician are running assembly line medical practices and are far more concerned about how many patients a day they can move through their office in much the same way that servers in high-volume restaurants are concerned about how many tables they can move during their shift: It is the attempt to /appear/ to care rather than actual concern for the person who is being cared for. That said, I have been fortute enough to have experiences with truly professiol doctors who I often describe as being scientists rather than simply being a part of the medical industry, ""machine,"" so to speak. The pediatrician for my children is a remarkable man who is often willing to spend thirty minutes with each of my children making sure that they have no troubles and beyond that even longer discussing any concerns I have about my children's health. When one of my children needed a fairly minor surgery I was just overwhelmed by the doctor he recommended for it. He was intelligent, concerned, professiol, and not rushed. He was clearly very busy, but he was willing and able to discuss all of my concerns. All things considered, the majority of doctors are not professiols. The professiols are few and far between and rarely encountered in a random selection of doctors."
-1	My doctor augmented my lexapro prescription with wellbutrin, and her knowledge to do that was very thorough in my opinion.
-1	While I don't currently have a primary care physician, in the past I have had pretty good doctors. For the most part, I trust them. However, I take some of what they prescribe or suggest with a little grain of salt. Doctors don't take all of the body's systems into account or preventative care when diagnosing or prescribing. They are taught medicine; not nutrition or other tural ways to heal.
-1	Some doctors don't listen to my needs and concerns.  Many doctors act as if they are impervious to my pain.  Doctors have a tendency not to explain enough about the diagnosis or why they picked the prescription drug they prescribed.
1	I fully trust my primary care MD because we have a longtime patient/Dr relationship.  She is fully aligned with my health outcome goals and supports me toward those.
-1	While my doctor can sometimes seem a bit rushed and hurried to get out of the room I do trust him.  Even though he goes through the options a bit fast he does let me know all the options I have.  I know he has my best interest in mind. 
1	She works with me on a care plan whereas most physicians that I've ever seen in the past just assume they know whats best for you and you don't get a say in the matter.
1	My doctor is known for having excellent bedside manner. She explains medications thoroughly and answers every question fully.
-1	I find that doctors are quick to prescribe medication for symptoms that can be maged otherwise.  I feel it's unnecessary in some cases.  When I have spoken to my doctor about altertive or tural medicine, she is quick to deny it's efficacy, but when I use it, it works.  There have also been times I had to self diagnos because my doctors weren't thoroughly looking into my symptoms.
-1	I believe most doctors a trustworthy and are in that profession because they truly want to help patients which equates to them being trustworthy.
-1	I haven't been to my primary care doctor in years. I sometimes feel like doctors over prescribe and over medicalize everything, when there could be more simple solutions. For example, there is proof of doctors over prescribing antibiotics when it isn't necessary.
-1	According to their knowledge and experience doctors will give you advice that is safer for one's health.
-1	In general, I am a skeptical person so probably likely to questions all things, so it seems like I am not completely trusting. Also, I don't feel like the doctor listens carefully to what I am saying, so I am hesitant to put complete in the doctor.  I don't think the doctor will intentiolly lead me in a wrong direction but maybe not the best option for me. 
-1	Doctors that I have dealt with have been upfront with me and told me what is wrong and what I should do about it. Beating around the bush is very uncommon.
-1	My GP is fairly new at this practice. She is a NP and I think she gets a little hesitant about making decisions on what medication to give you. This in turn makes me nervous. Overall, I trust doctors but I also arm myself with knowledge. I will not take a new medication without researching it. Doctors do not have the time to know everything there is about a medicine they're prescribing. So, a pharmacist and research can be your best friend when it comes to your health.
-1	Doctors are rushed, constrained by my insurance (or lack thereof) and are only human so I have a hard time trusting physicians. I usually put my trust in them though because I don't trust myself either. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is our family doctor and she always explain my condition to me and refer me to a specialty when I need one,she take good care of me and my whole family.  
1	Well if anyone knows me better than myself it would be my doctor hopefully so I yeah I have trust in my doctor
-1	Doctors in general do a great job. I have run into some that haven't and it makes me realize that I need to be careful with the doctor I visit. Most doctors are very considerate and will provide info, but some are more interested in seeing as many patients as possible.
1	I have been seeing her for many years and she has never given me reason not to trust her. She is kind and I really look forward to seeing and speaking with her. I feel that she cares about me persolly, and I am not just a number. 
-1	Sometimes doctors assume I don't do or don't know (fill in blank) or they think of me in terms of a stereotypical type of person who is my age and gender. I like to know just about all the details and even the recent research done on whatever is bothering me, so it's lucky I don't have a condition. I trust myself more than a doctor, in general. They can't know more about me than I do.   
1	My primary care physician is a really responsible and nice person. Actually, the doctors I saw in general are responsible and nice. Based on how they treated me every time, very professiol and knowledgeable; how they spent time explaining things to me, answering my questions with great patience, even stupid questions sometimes. If I have problems with meds or my symptoms, I can call their offices and get quick responses. I will get a phone call reminding me about my upcoming treatments and appointments. I feel that I can completely trust them to take care of my health.
-1	I regularly trust doctors but i recognize that they sometimes might be biased towards recommending certain medicaments. I don't really pay attention to that though.
-1	I have never had one regular primary care physician as I have moved around a lot. My experiences have varied from one doctor to another. They are all individual human beings with different persolities and flaws.
-1	I've never really had a reason not to trust my physician. They have always given me what I've needed to feel better and have always been thorough and clear. They make things convenient for me.
1	I trust my dr because after not going to one in 14 years, I filly found one and she makes me feel safe and respected. 
1	He has given me prescriptions that have alleviated my depression and anxiety issues. He seems to really care because he wants to see me every month and examine how the medications exactly affects me and make changes. When I tell him I have worries about my heart he always checks and listens to my heart for a minute. I have no reason to doubt his honesty.
1	My Dr. is very good, caring, and is one of the better ones the local Free Clinic in my community has.  My first confidence in her was also boosted a little when after a first medical appointment I also had needed to get a perscription refilled for anxiety/depression and found that the psychiatric nurse I see at a Human Development Center my community has not only knew her but said that she felt that I was in good hands having been put in the physician's hands then proceeded to tell me a little about her background, experience, etc.  She also had suspected pre-diabetes in me, we did the blood test which proved right and I started following her reccomendations and feel much better.  She is also very humble- I went to thank her after an appointment using the title Dr., and her last me.  She immediately corrected me, thanked me for thinking that and said that she was only a P.A. and would prefer use of her first me.
1	Most doctors are businessmen first and doctors second, meaning that medical practice has transitioned from a profession to a crass, me-first money making operation. Most of the docs I know care about caring, and serving the best interests of their patients; but I have to acknowledge that for more than a few docs, money matters a lot.
-1	I don't trust any doctors.  I have had many problems in the past with many different doctors. They do not know have of what they think they know.
1	I feel that although most physicians have a high degree of integrity, I would contend that one is ultimately responsible for one's own well being. That said, not all heath care professiols are beyond scrutiny. I myself have experienced one such doctor who was self serving and egregious in the care of his patients. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician, because she remember all my health history, and she is very good. 
-1	This would be doctors in general. While I had a few doctors I trusted completely (in another state), I currently don't have that trust established here. I don't like to fight what is the right type of birth control pill to take (one phase or several phases) and then getting a prescription for the wrong type anyway and having another battle.  That was only one instance and one doctor (who is no longer my doctor). I had other issues where I had to take a stand to make sure that my preferred treatment was even considered.  I am not talking about altertive remedies, but established treatments.
-1	If I didn't trust the doctor and did not believe in his or her abilities and commitment to patients, I wouldn't be seeing this doctor. The standard of care for pretty much any injury or illness is established by governing medical bodies based on scientific evidence. With some small variation pretty much every doctor will prescribe the same treatment under the same medical circumstances. If I trust modern medicine there is no grounds for distrusting the care my doctor suggests. Which doctor I go to is mainly a matter of my convenience and my persol perceptions.
-1	"I feel like everyone is in a hurry and the perception / feelings is no one really cares. Myself and everyone else is just a number out of billions. I feel like I am just a process and not a person. Dr's tend to see all of their patience day to day, hour to hour, week to week for the purpose of the paycheck and the fincial gains. It has nothing to do with health care or the needs and wants of a persons healthcare, it is all about money and big money at that. Healthcare and everyone involved in the healthcare industry is all about the ""Market"" of making money. "
-1	It's hard to trust a doctor these days with the amount of money that is involved it's more about money than people I'm afraid.   
-1	He comes into the room, asks me a couple of generic questions, and tries to get out of there in a hurry because he has other patients to deal with. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a means to his golf course membership. 
-1	I do not trust my doctor, because it feels like my doctor doesn't trust me when I'm explaining what is wrong with me. It feels like he rushes our appointment instead of taking the time to hear me out.
1	I trust my physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction. Every time I had a medical condition he has been able to properly diagnosis it and come up with a treatment option. He always offered multiple treatment options that I could take.
1	I totally trust my physician because she spends time and talks to me on various subjects and tells me what are all the pros and cons of various disorders. She is straightforward so I guess I am lucky. Whatever I expect from my doctor I am getting from her, be it anything even if I am hesitant she makes sure I am taken care of and I am in good hands
1	I do not have a primary care physician and avoid seeing doctors when at all possible. However, I do see a clinical psychologist at least weekly, and I trust her completely. She has been working with me for several years now, has been very helpful, and always seems to have her patients' interest first. She goes out of her way to be kind and respect who I am as a person. As for doctors in general, my experiences have been very mixed - some very caring and helpful, others very cold, disrespectful, and arrogant. With that being the case, when I do have to resort to seeing a doctor, I try to keep an open mind, but I also find that I try to gather as much pertinent information as possible before I go to an appointment, communicate the problem clearly (and ONLY the current problem, no extraneous information), and let them know what has worked for me in the past if I've had this issue before. I find it difficult to trust doctors who seem to have their own agenda - for instance, ones who insist on prescribing medications that I know are not really effective for me, or ones who treat every patient as though they're a drug addict (and there are a LOT of these doctors in our area).
1	He is the most well known and highly recommended doctor in my area. He is always extremely thorough and compassiote
-1	I trust my physician because I believe they have no reason to lie to me about my health. They are paid professiols and they get paid to inform me about my health.
1	I trust the doctor because has has a long career and has been through many experiences in his practice.  He has not been sued for malpractice and he is still in business. In our relationship, he has not led me wrong and has always given helpful advise.
1	My doctor always takes his time to explain to me what is going on with my health. He is very caring and listens to my concerns.
-1	I wouldn't say that I have complete trust. They do what they can do. For anything that is beyond their scope of expertise, they send you to a specialist.
1	My doctor is very persoble and understanding when I am having problems struggling with depression and anxiety. When I have needed extra help, she has recommended other helpful resources for me to take advantage of, and when I've needed medication changes, she has helped me set up appointments with a psychiatrist.
1	My doctor actually takes the time to listen and ask questions and not just talk over me or assume 
1	I feel a primary care physician or doctor is trained and highly skilled in their area of expertise. I respect this, although I am cautious and will consult a second opinion if I think it is needed.
1	primary care physician is one of the best things that we can do to ensure better care for ourself. This is because we are likely to become more trusting of our doctor as we see one another over the years, so this can lead to better communication, consistent treatment compliance, and regular appointments. For these reasons, it is important to take the time to find a clinic and primary care physician that we trust.
1	I've been going to him since I was fourteen, and he's seen everyone in my family for years. He asks about how we're doing, he makes sure we know exactly what's going on, and he is one of our friends. 
1	The doctors I've dealt with have all been upfront and straightforward with me about whatever condition I've had. They've never deceived me and I've had no reason to distrust them or the advice they've given.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he really cares about my health and well being. He is very patient, and informative. 
-1	I trust my doctor a greater deal. She has always provided with a ton information for all treatments. When I call with questions she is always very happy to help or research information for me.
-1	I mostly trust my doctor. I think though that physicians generally think people are not smart enough to really understand medical information so they over simplify information or leave out certain information. My doctor is somewhat like this.
-1	I'm the kind of person that likes to verify everything myself. It turns out my doctor has been right most of the time. A couple of times he's been wrong. But hey, nobody's perfect, which is why it's important to verify.
-1	I have been going to the same office for around sixteen years. I have been seeing my current doctor now for seven years.  Being overweight he has always told me smaller steps to start losing weight. He always listens and looks into whatever i bring to his attention. He will even demonstrate small exercises if need be. Overall he is a kind doctor who looks out for his patients. If its something that beyond him and his office he is quick to refer you to a doctor that meats his standards which are high
1	First of all I am generally healthy and go to the doctor twice a year for check ups and blood work evaluations. My doctor is very observant of my physical condition and the medication I take. He is approachable, invites questions, gives you good suggestions for improving your health. I trust my doctor as he has referred me to specialists when he is in doubt. these specialists have always been excellent. I am so fortute to have a great doctor who is also a people person and is not going to treat you for something in a field where he is not an expert.
-1	For myself, I go to Planned Parenthood for all my medical needs, so the person who sees me for my medical needs always changes; I never know who I will get. Some practitioners seem quite trusting, while other can't wait to end their day. I think most give good advice, but I always like to double check when it's something very, very important.
-1	I usually feel like the doctor is busy and has a lot of things going on at once. Sometimes I get the impression they don't really listen. All in all I say I have to trust their advice but sometimes I feel they can be real impersol.
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel that he cares about me and wants to help me
1	I've gone to my PCP since I was a child, we have a really good relationship. 
-1	I find that my PCP is quite busy, and my time with him is limited.   I also find that the information he (and other PCP(s) I have dealt with) offers is not complete, and that I better understand medical issue(s) by conducting additiol research on my own, and also seeking specialist referral(s) and appropriate testing. 
1	From the past experiences I have had with my doctor, the care/medicines he has prescribed me has always helped. Also my doctor makes sure & give me the option to choose the medication instead of forcing it on me.
1	My primary care physician is a very nice young woman and I have been to her several times over the past years.  She has always told me what is necessary and I have never sensed any dishonesty in speaking with her.  She has told me the truth about everything I have asked about. She also listens to what I told her I thought was the problem.  She has agreed with me on many occasions. She has referred me to another physician when she thought it was beyond her scope.  I have asked for prescriptions that I felt would be necessary for me and she has complied and agreed with me.  She is young and I feel she has the most current knowledge possible.  I have never looked at her as inexperienced.  She has always presented herself very professiol and she presents herself as very knowledgeable.  In conversations with her, she IS actually knowledgeable. 
1	I have been going to the same doctor for a good number of years.  He is always willing to sit and discuss with me and explain to be anything I am unsure of.
-1	I have seen many doctors that seem rushed when doing their jobs.
-1	Sometimes I suspect if the doctor is looking for his own benefit rather than the patient's benefit, as it happens a lot. for example, advising for a surgery while it is not necessary or a very little benefit will result out of it.
-1	My doctor almost always explains everything she says in great detail, something which I very much appreciate. If she cannot do that, she will show me on the computer or from a book what she is talking about. So, any lack of trust I have is just myself being paranoid.
1	He seems direct about my choices. He has good eye contact and is calm, not holding back information. 
-1	He doesn't have a deep understanding of some issues, like mental health, but has some standard medications and advice that he shares. Even though there's some areas he could be better in, he's not one of those stubborn primary care doctors that have it in their heads that they know everything.
-1	For the most part I have trust in my doctor's decisions, but I don't have complete trust  in anybody except the Lord. I value the doctor's advice, but I would not follow him blindly and if I feel he is not right on something I would not hesitate to get a second opinion or other counsel. I weigh my own thoughts with what he tells me. 
-1	I primarily trust my primary doctor. She is super nice and always answers all of my questions thoroughly and takes time to explain whats going on. That builds the trust every time I see her.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I find him to be credible, well educated, and trustworthy.  He provides attention and familiarity with the issues that have faced me in the past, and face me currently.  Additiolly, he is well reputed in the medical community and has to my knowledge provided sound treatment and service to me. 
1	I trust my doctor because, she always seems to have my best interest at heart when every i go to see my doctor for something she always go in to deep questioning into what is the problems i am having, and when she prescribe a diagnosis and or medication she always take the time explain everything i needs to know she never rushes with her patients. 
-1	She  has always been  great .. answers any question I may have and askes question s I have never thought of.
1	I trust him because he has open communication and when I ask questions I get honest responses as well as way to be even more health and get better
-1	I believe that my doctor can be a bit hasty sometimes when its a busy day but I still trust his knowledge.  Consultations seem a bit short, but all in all I am typically out the door with a prescription that will  help me feel better and they always do.  I think when and if there is something of greater concern than a common cold,  he'll be more likely to spend more time to explain the condition and treatment.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for a long time. He always explains things to me in detail. He doesn't rush, or ignore my questions.
-1	I feel like now days, doctors are in a rush to get patients out of the office, and not so interested in what is going on with the patient, only what they think or the easiest way to get the patient to leave.
-1	He is an expert.  He has practical experience.  He seems like a good person.
-1	I do trust my primary care physician because he is really care about his patients with heart, perhaps he has aged with a happy family. I never seen any patients is not satisfied with his services. He also has a lot of nice staffs at his clinic office. He always clearly explains and give the hard copy of your heath notes if you have any concerns.  
-1	I generally trust them, and believe they would consciously act in my best interest but at the same I acknowledge they may be overworked, see many cases a day, and may overlook details. 
-1	The do not listen. My issues are important and they do not take them serious. It is annoying.
1	I trust my doctor a lot.  Like me, she is a woman, so I know that she has gone through some of the same things as I have.  She spends a lot of time with me and really explains everything.
1	I trust my doctor because thus far i have not been given a reason not to trust her and her expertise. 
1	I trust my doctor because he shows genuine care for me. He goes above and beyond and he gives me all options to consider when i have to choose
-1	I trust my current physician. I just recently had a problem and my new doctor actually did all they could to find the problem. All of my searching and information I had from myself they ordered all those tests and asked all the right stuff that matched up so I trust them now.
1	My PCP has always been nice and caring.  I don't have a reason to not trust him or doubt him.  Everything has always worked out well.
-1	i have been with him for the longest time and i have never have any issues that i might have to second gues. if i did i usually ask him right then and there 
1	I have to trust the person I am trusting my life and future with. I cannot doubt their abilities. If for some reason I find I don't trust my doctor I find a new doctor. I have done it. I don't want to have to be concerned that my doctor does not have my best interest in mind.
-1	My regular doctor is great. She is not always available however, and then I question the replacements. 
1	He has never done anything to make me not trust him. I've always received good care from him.
-1	I think my doctor cares more about making a profit than my well-being. He will talk about my condition and answer questions, but anything that doesn't involve pharmaceutical drugs, he shuts down as bogus. I don't believe that. I don't feel he is very thorough and I really only go to the doctor if absolutely necessary. 
-1	they seem kind of crooked
1	I have been going to my doctor for about 30 years.  He is also a personal friend of my husbands.  At the same time, he is a very conscientious and caring doctor so I trust that he has my best interest at heart.  He is also passionate about his profession and has been in practice for a long time so I am sure he is very knowledgeable.
1	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy as if they're not, then what is the point of them chosing their profession if they just want to scam people?
-1	My doctor is a confident and intelligent person whom I respect. He is willing to here my thought s and opinions on my own health and but as I have cultivated a reputation of years with the man, I know that I can trust in his expertise. 
1	I really think that he tries to make the best decisions for my care. I generally place a good deal of trust in him. If I didn't trust him, I would look for another physician.
1	My doctor has always been open to questions and replies with swift honest answers.He is highly trained, caring and gives no reason for me to doubt him. he has also been my family doctor since 1998.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes time to listen to my problems and examines me thoroughly. He is also smart and empathetic.
1	I've had no reason to not trust him. He always explains things well to me. He doesn't do unnecessary tests and doesn't seem interest d in overbilling for things, just gets right to the point and gets me out of there. 
1	I've been going to my primary physician for years, he's always tried to help me to the best of his ability.
1	My doctor has always shown me great care.
-1	This person seems to be pretty objective in their decisions. I don't see them as the kind of doctor to recommend a lot of unnecessary tests. They mostly seem to want what is good for me.
1	I think he is competent and knows what he is doing. He will be honest with me and let me know what the situation is. If something is out of his realm then he will refer me to a proper specialist.
-1	I trust my Dr. but I also research my options on my own. I believe the Dr. acts in my best interest but still may not know what is best for me. Is is always better to be informed.
-1	I cant say whether or not if i trust or distrust my  doctor. In all honesty it depends upon the situation at hand.
1	My doctor is very verbal about what he thinks is happening. He explains the symptoms and what step should be taken to help cure the problem.
-1	I'm a person who needs a lot of information and completely capable of understanding complex medical research. If I think they are hedging or not giving me all the options, I'll find another doctor. If they explain and give me detailed information I trust them.
-1	"I disagree with a lot of what is taught in ""conventional"" medicine and I do not believe doctors are taught everything they should be taught and are left ""ignorant"" in regard to a lot of important information. Most doctors are trained to be ""pill dispensers"" and are not trained to discover the root cause of most illness. I don't blame doctors as much as I blame the ""establishment"" for the way they teach medicine and put so much emphasis on getting as many patients in and out as possible and maximizing profit."
1	I had the same doctor growing up and for a few years into adulthood. When I became a nurse I started noticing that my doctor seemed to just want to get out of the room and didn't really seem to care much. I switched doctors several times before finding the one I am currently a patient of and he is amazing. He truly cares and takes time with each patient to provide the best care possible.
-1	I think that they listen to me and try to understand me. But sometimes I question the treatment they suggest. I don't know if it is the only one, best one or the most convenient for the medical practice one. I want to trust them, but I do have to watch out for myself too.
-1	Sometimes I feel like doctors are so pressed for time they are just trying to get out of the room. Also, I worry about their relationships to insurance and drug companies that might influence their course of treatment. I don't think they wish to do harm, they are just conflicted.
1	I trust doctors because they're well-trained and well-intentioned. However, like in many professions, skill level varies with experience and with the doctor in general. Also, there are always more and more cutting edge treatments and statistical evidence being released that often changes things significantly. On top of this, the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and doctors does cause some concern. So a patient should always do due diligence when it comes to any serious procedure, condition, or medication. That being said, the doctor is almost always going to improve your situation and make you aware of what your health circumstances are.
-1	I don't have complete trust in my doctor. He is smart and he cares, but he's been wrong too many times and I've had to look elsewhere for answers. I've figured out things on my own that he couldn't after several visits.
1	I have complete trust in my family physician.
-1	Doctors are human. They have their own interests like everyone else. So there is going to be bias in there decisions.
-1	Doctors and arrogant and a high percentage of them are sociopaths. They represent the pharmaceutical industry and they will deny their rx drug prescriptions caused anyone any harm. Doctors are unethical and dangerous as they put their ego and money ahead of the public's best interest. I stay away from them and hate most I have ever had the misfortune to come in contact with.  The only times I have gotten better from anything is when i have avoided or stopped going to allopathic doctors. 
-1	I have no doc at the moment.  In general I trust no one so everything is approached with skepticism
1	They have more knowledge and experience than I do so I do trust what they have to say. They took an oath to protect their patients and I believe that most try to follow trough on that oath. 
1	I have been seeing him for many years he treats my children and spouse as well so we have discuses many things over the years and I am comfortable with him.
-1	Dr's are people like everyone else, and people will always do what is best for them. Maybe they are in a bad mood and want to leave maybe they are getting kickbacks for prescribing a certain drug/treatment. My dr has tried to keep me on a medication that there was no real reason for me to be on, when I pressed her on why she wanted me to take it she could really give me a good reason beyond she said so. 
1	"He goes through each option, detail by detail, explains the pros and cons, prices and impact on my health. He often says ""Full disclosure, I benefit from people being RX'd this drug."" If I have suggestions from research, he takes those into consideration and allows me to participate in my care."
1	down to earth, admits when he doesnt know something, is more then helpful and up front
1	I have been seeing my primary doctor for over a decade. She is always willing to listen to my concerns, sets aside enough time to answer any questions I have, and is always willing to listen to any input I want to offer & make any needed modifications to any needed treatment accordingly. I trust her primarily because she has demonstrated, over a number of years, that she is trustworthy.
-1	Primary care physician might not have enough knowledge to make an informed decision. The doctor might not be up to date with the latest treatments.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he treats me kindly.
1	My doctor appears to spend the time necessary to understand my conditions/concerns and address them. She is willing to admit when she does not know something and refers me to a specialist that can help. It probably helps that I am friends with one of her nurses (friends before I started seeing the doctor).
-1	They don't really seem interested in what I had to say about my body and the side effects of the drugs i'm often prescribed. They sound like a shill trying to get me on many different medications
-1	Wrote this in the other section but fits here better. They write down possible conditions and never tell me so I have to read it on my medical records to understand why they are asking me something.
-1	I don't see a doctor regularly. In fact, I haven't been to the doctor in 8 years. The reason for this is because the doctor seemed overly concerned with herself, made me feel horrible about myself, recommended a method of birth control that caused damage, didn't give adequate information about the medicine and was overall in a bad mood the whole time. After that visit I had a reduction in funds so I was not able to find a better doctor. Without health insurance, that is difficult. So I just never went back.
-1	I only get 10-15 minutes with my physician. She's overworked, I don't think doctors have the time to fully explain everything to each patient.
-1	My doctor just rushes through things, but i think she always goes with the best choice
1	I trust my primary care physician because they are very friendly, understanding, caring and helpful. They always make me feel comfortable asking questions and such. They also always keep my best interest in mind, and making sure I am comfortable with everything before proceeding.
1	He's been my doctor for years I know him outside of his work. I trust what he says but sometimes I don't want to follow his advice.
1	In regard to doctors in general, I feel that most put people first and are there because they generally care about people. I don't believe any doctor will intentionally mislead a patient, because I don't think any of them want to face the repercussions from doing so. Ultimately, if they don't treat their patients right, they won't be practicing much longer.
1	I trust my primary physician, I've had the same doctor since I was a child and they're always very thorough. We often spend quite a bit of time when an issue arises to ensure we're taking the proper steps to rectify the situation.  
-1	I'm with tricare. The doctors there aren't paid to push any specific brand of drugs. They have a lot of expertise in their field and see a lot of patients on a daily basis so their opinion carries a lot of weight. They aren't restricted by budget so much as other practices so they're more likely to recommend tests that other practices may have avoided.
-1	While I do trust my doctor, I still seek out additional information when I feel it necessary.  My doctor has never violated my trust.  I still feel like you can't be too careful, because everyone has bad days and could miss something.
1	I really like my PCP. She's super nice and understanding. She explains everything really well and makes sure to focus on me while I'm there. She always asks how I'm doing and about non medical aspects of my life. I feel like she cares.
1	My primary care physician takes his time trying to find out what is wrong with me. He doesn't jump to a conclusion or pass me off as a customer. There have been a couple of situations that, I could see, kind of stumped him in diagnosing the cause. That made me feel more at ease then him coming to a decision/conclusion quickly. 
1	I have never had any problems with her since I have been seeing her. She always answers any questions I have and always makes sure I don't have any unanswered questions before leaving the office. She always checks everything to make sure she has diagnoised me correctly. 
1	I trust my primary care physician. He has never been wrong about any medical condition I have ever had. He always explains everything that he feels may be complicated to understand. He always answers all of my questions very thoroughly.
-1	I think I can trust any medical guys that I come in counter with, I haven't met any quacks yet In my life time.
-1	I don't trust medical professionals because sometimes they may be sponsored by a drug manufacturer, and they just perform medical services to promote their sponsors. Really don't trust doctors.
1	I have never had reason not to trust a doctor. This could be because I have always had pretty good health but event he small issues i have had were taken care of without problems or concerns.
-1	since I'm the only one on this planet that knows me the best, I make sure to research every possible item no matter how trustworthy, skilled or experience the health professional is. people are not perfect and they do make mistakes. 
1	He makes me help safe when I talk to him. I trust in this ability to give me anwsers when every I feel hopeless.
1	I just have always liked them and felt right with them. They are always good to me
1	My doctor is through and never makes us feel rushed. We feel like we are the only one there. They watch our medications to warn us of a conflict. They tell us all of the side effects.
1	i trust my doctor because they know i'm a nurse and we are able to communicate in the same medical terms.
-1	My doctor is relatively young, but I feel like he has grown over the 5 or so years I've seen him. Professional growth is a good sign that he is at least trying. I don't trust him completely because I live in an area that the best professionals tend to avoid. I assume he is a bit of a reject. Also, how can you trust any doctor when most of them spend all of 6 minutes diagnosing you?
1	I trust my primary car physician because he has been my doctor since I was born. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he's young like myself and I think that he has my best interest at heart. He gets the times that we live in and he knows that many times you don't need a doctor you just need to trust yourself and body and exercise good judgement to ensure that I live as long as I possibly can. With the help of God of course.
-1	If he can help me get better 
1	I have had bad doctors in the past, I like the relationship i have with this doctor now, I totally trust him, not everyone graduates is good at their job but mine is, at least with me
-1	It makes me very uncomfortable that doctors can receive 'kickback' payments from drug manufacturers to recommend their products.
-1	The doctor will give you a treatment option that they are familiar with and usually that is not all the options that are available. Insurance companies also influence doctors and the type of treatments they cover. Research the subject on your own, in my opinion.
-1	I distrust doctors based on experience of them misdiagnosing me and telling me my issues are imagined. If they dont know about a rare disease they tend to often want to dismiss you. 
-1	I wouldn't say I trust or distrust doctors in general. I just believe that they can be wrong or inaccurate at times.
1	I have the most amazing doctor who is friendly and open to anything you have to say. He is very willing to listen when you are talking. He has great values and will give you his honest opinion. I love how good his bed side manner is. He makes you feel comfortable as soon as he walks in the room.
-1	I feel that doctors sometimes have motivation to pursue a certain treatment plan without narrowly tailoring it to my needs.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she's been there for me for the last decade. I've gone to her whenever I had issues, major or minor. I've built a relationship with her. That always helps. If I go to a new doctor, I don't think I will have that same feeling.
-1	I trust my doctor because my whole family has been going to her for years. I've known her since I was a little kid and now i'm 35. She knows everything about me and she knows how to talk to me.
-1	I usually trust my physician because they have no reason to lie to me.  They go based off of current medical information.  Sometimes I get frustrated when I know I need an antibiotic to help me but they refuse or dance around the issue.
-1	I trust him because he doesn't try to upsell me on anything and takes a very relaxed and practical approach to things.  For example, I need to lose about 30 pounds, instead of being hysterical, he suggested I aim for 1 pound a month.
1	My doctor takes her time with me and I never feel rushed. She will ask about me and give me a chance to ask questions. She engages in real life examples and will put things in plain terms.
-1	I feel like I have trust in my primary care physician. I feel like they have my best interests in mind and they try to solve any problem that I come to them for. They are really good at what they do.
-1	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. But sometimes doctors make choices based on insurance issues, drug company promotion, and other things that are not always good for my general well being.
1	I work with my doctor and I really like him. He is very good at listening and let me be apart of my treatment plan. 
-1	I do not trust doctors because I have no reason to trust them. They are doctors because they went to school and got a degree. I trust myself much more.
-1	I trust them because they know a lot about what they are doing and they care about the patients. They have the awareness to know how to take action
-1	I have established a relationship with my doctor over a few years, and find his advice to be pretty trustworthy for the most part. If I ask about other options, he is glad to take the time to talk to me. 
1	My doctor is always very open with their thoughts on any condition I come to them about.  They always give me a chance to ask questions and always make sure that I have a chance to say everything I feel is important.
-1	I've been seeing him for +10 years. He's extremely thorough. I could complain about a slight ache and he'd order a whole x-ray just to be sure nothing else is going on. He's very competent and has listened to me in the past and talked to me
1	I have been with my physician almost my entire life.  He has on more than one occasion diagnosed me with something that the hospital did not.  Everyone in my town looks up to this man as a talented diagnostician.  If I need a note, he never objects, he always helps me out of things if I need it.  I even have his cell phone if there is an emergency, and he has neglected to charge me a few times when I have been going through financial hardships.  He cares deeply about all his patients and it really shows.
-1	I think my doctor is quick with my visits and so I've started to limit my engagement with him. He's often brushed off concerns in the past as well.
-1	My urologist is a little young, so it was kind of scary trusting him with my goods. But he showed confidence in himself and it made me feel confident in him. 
-1	he is an okay physician. i dont visit him much but when i do, he does his job and asks me questions. he gives me prescriptions
1	I trust my doctor to be completely honest with me. They took an oath in medical school to help people and be truthful.  
1	I've never been given a reason to distrust him and I haven't been steered wrong yet so until that happens hes good in my book
-1	Waiting around for an hour and more in order to talk with a guy for a few minutes annoys me.  I know they're busy, but I hate feeling rushed.  I feel like just another patient file/number.
1	I trust them because they have a lot more knowledge about medical issues than I do. I think most if not all got into the profession to help people, and I dont think they would risk their reputations to harm me. 
-1	the truth I do not distrust any doctor if they are in the position they are because something they did well I do not think they have failed
1	I have developed a strong relationship with my primary care doctor. I have seen him for many years now and he has been successful at helping me through various illnesses with success. 
-1	I've had so many doctors that simply do not care about their patients, do not explain risks in procedures or medications. The latest doctor I had gave me extremely powerful drugs without explaining their side effects and effectively crippled me (ruined the tendons in my legs).
1	My primary care physician has always behaved very professionally with me. He is open to answering my questions and will explain things to me when necessary. I know he has had years of schooling and he is very knowledgeable.
-1	Some doctors seem more interested in selling extra products that I really don't need..Seems they just want the extra income.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because she does a thorough check with me when I see her for daily check ups. She is always very patient and kind despite how mean some patients can be. She also suggests where I can run tests that won't cost me money. There's never been an incident where I lost my trust in her.
1	I think that he holds himself to high standards and has always showed me respect and understands me and is compassionate. He has never gave me any reason for me to not trust him. He is always honest and straight forward with me, and that is how I prefer it.
1	I have been with this group for some time now and I feel like they have alway took good care of me so I think I can trust what they are saying and doing for me and I have no reserves
-1	I generally trust them to do what is right and make me feel better in the end, although sometimes they only give me one option for moving forward, when I often feel like there are probably many options I have, but they just aren't telling me about it.  I think they only tell me the one that they think is right or best.
-1	Because he can attend all the patient it would be very good and nice of it.Great so we can trust physician and it will be very good
1	My primary care physician listens to my questions and concerns, explains her thought process about diagnosis, and works with me to resolve any lingering health issues (fortunately, I'm relatively healthy). She also has evening and weekend hours, so I appreciate her willingness to work around patients' schedules.
-1	I have to trust that my doctor is going to say and do what is in my best interests. I want to know exactly what can be and needs to be done in order to get or stay healthy. I want to be confident that my doctor is going to do the things that they have sworn to do as a medical professional, and thinking that they may not be doing so is too upsetting to even consider. 
-1	being inj good health just doesn't need a lot of advice from a dr. treatments are a few pills a day and i feel fine
-1	I trust my doctors in general. I don't think there is any reason for a doctor to lie to me or try and deceive me. They may not always be the most attentive or take the most time to get to know what's wrong, but I don't think they're ever intentionally deceitful or anything like that.
-1	I think doctors at times will push what is easiest for them or what they think might be a option that is a little more costly when the risk is not too high. I feel like anything else doctors are out to make money. They may ask you to do unneccesary tests as well at times.
-1	Although I have only been seeing my current doctor for 6 months, she caught a health issue that made a difference in my life. I trust her to be thorough and give me the care i need. I feel that I need to be with her longer to fully form my opinion, but so far I trust her and believe she is honest. 
-1	I've been going to the same doctor my whole life, and when I was younger it seemed like he knew what he was doing. Now that he's older, it seems like he just wants to get patients out of his office as quickly and as possible. Prescribe some medicine and you're good to go. I like not spending a lot of time in the doctor's office, but it does make me wonder if he actually knows what he's doing.
-1	They're not bad. They haven't given me a reason to distrust them and have been okay so far as far as I can tell.
-1	I have a new doctor. I am still learning about him. He is older and I trust him but I also pay attention. 
1	I feel that my doctor has my trust because she is always willing to provide me with information as well as make sure I understand everything before I leave, she takes the time to show compassion for me.
-1	I would prefer that all the information relative to my body be listed and discussed and added to the procedure of what we're going to do with my body.
-1	My doctor is open with me and generally is able to answer all of my questions.  Though I feel like the doctor is always in a rush and doesn't explain things as fully as possible.
-1	I trust my doctor because this is his job and his expertise. He has a background and knowledge of the subject, so I am really in no place to second guess him. I can ask questions for further explaination or instruction
-1	I am a very careful person and consider myself to be well read. I ask questions and do research on my conditions and medications. 
-1	i've had a variety of different primary care physicians and this varies for all of them - but sometimes i do get the sense that they're not being very thorough or diligent and just wanting to see the next patient
-1	I do not have a stable primary care physician at this time.  With doctors in the past it generally seems as if they are just handling another number in line and waiting to get through to the next person and the person after that.  They generally don't seem to listen very well.  
-1	"She is very busy and quick and gives recommendations rather than talking to me and asking if I want a certain test or procedure. In general I prefer a less ""medical"" approach to health care than she does."
-1	I currently don't have a primary care doctor so it's hard for me to answer this question. When I do have a problem I will go to an expres clinic and I've had good and bad experiences. More good than bad. I try to put my trust in doctors but sometimes they are worried about getting people in and out of the room like cattle. 
-1	Well I'm more so neutral because I have new physician due to living in a college town while attending.  I've only had to go to her so far for a health check up for insurance purposes.  I had nothing wrong with me so there wasn't any real medical needs present at that time.
-1	For the most part I trust my primary care physician. When other doctors had turned down sending me to a specialist for a condition that I had for several years that still had not been addressed, my primary care doctor sent me to a specialist to get it checked out. Furthermore, some small issues that I had been having over the years she took the time to look into to give me a full and proper diagnosis. 
-1	I trust doctors for the most part because they have dedicated their lives to helping others. Because of this, I assume that they have my best interests in mind, especially when it comes to my personal health. 
-1	I have a rare condition and itâs obvious my pcp does not know a whole lot about it. Also I feel like doctors are rushed and donât take the time to do the best care
1	I trust my doctor because he seems to know what he is doing and is always super friendly. It helps that we are friends outside of work too. I feel like I could go to him about anything and he will do what is best for me no matter what it takes.
-1	I trust my primary care physician as she seems dedicated to providing good care and she is well educated. She does however rush through patient visits and many times downplays my concerns or refers me to other people for the answers I need such as nurses or the pharmacy.    
1	I have known my primary care physician for a long long time now, and every time I get sick or I need help with a medical condition he is there for me, always knows what is going on and always helps me
-1	I have been seeing the same family care physician since I was born so I have come to trust him. However, I do feel that every doctor has their own way of thinking that might be different from my way of thinking. 
1	My doctor helped cure the problems I had with my neck and shoulder for over a year and listened to everything I said and was very helpful in getting everything done. It was better than seeing other doctors I had seen before.
1	In general, I trust doctors to be highly skilled and highly knowledgeable in their practice. I do believe they genuinely care about helping others and want to look out for the best interests of their patients.
1	my pcp seems to be very knowledge and takes her time whenever I visit with her. she does not push unnecessary tests and always takes the time to explain answers to any questions I may have. she gives me all the options for certain treatments and gives me her opinion on which is best but always leaves the final option up to be. I feel I can trust her and I have not been disappointed in the past
1	I have never had a major medical issue come up for me.  It's always something minor like a cold, sore throat, or something along those lines.  When I have taken my daughter to the doctor it is always for something minor as well.  Our doctors have always given great advice and the right prescriptions for our needs.  I have no reason not to trust them, but I know I  might feel different if I went to the doctor more often.
-1	I know that healthcare is a business and doctors are humans with the same outside stress as everyone else. I know they are sometimes in a rush and don't always make the right decisions.
1	I don't have a primary care physician, but I trust doctors in general. I believe that they are extremely knowledgable in their field, and took on the job because they have the desire to help people. Therefore, I would say that I am very trusting of their advice.
-1	I would have to say more than anything I feel a doctor is there to rush me in and out. I don't go very often but I never feel like I'm truly heard. I wait for 30-45 minutes for 5 minutes with them saying exactly what I have already told them and them prescribing something. I feel like I should be able to see a doctor nearly instantly for a cold, flu, or something common so I can be in and out and not waste my time.
1	She has always explained things to my satisfaction, both medically and with regard to insurance.  She has helped me and noticed other issues that I didn't really pay attention to, which I really appreciate.  She works hard to help me in any way.
1	I generally trust doctors in telling me what's wrong with me based on my symptoms.  My trust wavers however when it comes to being prescribed medications.  I feel sometimes doctors prescribe stuff that isn't needed in order to make money off that prescription.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician because I believe that they are generally caring about me and their other patients. Times where I have had issues with my health my primary care physician has been able to effectively diagnose and treat my illnesses and return me to the state that I should be in. I don't necessarily find any reason to distrust my doctor as she has given me no reason to. 
-1	I would like my doctor to give me more attention when it comes to my concerns about my health. I would like him to explain things to me better so I can get a better understanding of my health,
-1	Most doctors, including my PCP, make judgments about me based on how I look, not about my self or health in general. I frequently feel like my concerns are dismissed by doctors, or they treat me as if I am uneducated.
-1	I trust my primary care physician due to his professional background and the number of testimonies I've heard from others regarding his experience and their visits with him. He made it a point to build up such a reputation, and one should admire that.
-1	My doctor can come across as very demeaning and curt.  I think this may be because the only appt times I can make are late in the day and he is tired.  Probably more interested in ending the work day and getting home than dealing with my issues.
1	I have no reason to distrust. He has answered every question I have had about myself and family members without sugar coating anything. He is very upfront and honest.
-1	I've had my primary care physician for a long time. I like him and he's never done me wrong in the past. We have a good relationship and I trust that if something were to go wrong he'd give me the best options and treatment. 
1	i would trust most doctors. i only go to the gynecologist and optometrist, but they are both great. the only time i wouldnt listen to them is in regards to nutrition. 
-1	I was on a medication for 7 years that I really did not need. I did some of my own research and asked my doctor about it, and she took me off of it. Ever since, I have had trouble trusting her. 
1	I trust her because she has been my doctor for a couple of years now, and has had enough talks with me and has given me enough tests to where I have developed that trust over the years.
1	Thus, far I have had mostly positive experiences with my primary care doctor. Everything I have been prescribed has usually worked well enough.
-1	My neurologist prescribed me an anti-seizure medication -- I had not had any seizures while I have been taking the medicine. I trust a doctor until I have reason not to.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she is very thorough when I see her for visits. She allows me to ask as many questions as I like, and she really listens.
-1	I do not trust m primary care physician, nor do I trust doctors in general. I feel like no doctors really care about their patients, instead they only care about making money in this terrible for profit health care system we have here in the United States. 
-1	I have a medical problem right now that my doctor doesn't seem interested in figuring out. I think they dont really care
1	Doctors go through a lot of training and education to enter their careers, and there's a 100% chance that a doctor who is anywhere close to decent has more knowledge about health than I do.
1	I trust my doctor. He has always been candid with me and I have always been able to rely on his medical opinion. He is intelligent and has never failed me in the past.
-1	I trust my doctors in that they have education and experience in their fields whereas I do not.  However, I am a strong believer in advocating for yourself and getting second opinions and asking questions to be able to make the best choices for myself.
1	I've had the same doctor for the last three years. He seems pretty thorough and accomplishes everything that needs to be done during my visits. He's brought up tests I could do if I wanted to but doesn't push them on me.
-1	I don't think doctors get to where they are by being selfish and always looking out for themselves. Also, I believe people have an inherent good in them. So even if a doctor is having a bad day or something to that extent, I still think they will do their best to be helpful, answer questions, and get their patients back to normal health or to where they want to be health wise.
-1	I generally trust them becuase of all the schooling they had plus i can easily verify if they are lying by doing a quick search online in about 5 minutes
-1	I often feel rushed and that my treatment is according to protocol, not individual needs.  I often have to remind my doctor about other medication, side effects, etc.
-1	the doctor i have no is really not a big help. it seems like he is only in it for the number of patients he can handle in a day. he often has senior citizens so its hard for to relate to the mid age group. he has gotten so much botox that his face is tight looking like something off of tv i call him a rockstar. i feel like he doesnt really care and this is one of the reasons why i am going to be finding me a new doctor this year so i hope it will be soon
1	I trust my PCP because I have a long history with him. He asks appropriate questions to see how I am doing or feeling. I answer his questions honestly & never withhold any information that could affect my care or diagnosis.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I really think he acts in my best interests.  He is trained and more knowledgeable than I am in these areas and so I put my trust in him. 
-1	I trust my doctor, because I expect that he has my best health interest at heart. Sometimes, this may not be true which makes it difficult for patients when someone they expect to help them is rather callous to their call for aid. 
1	I trust my doctor or doctor's in general because otherwise why would I even go to them in the first place and if I am unsure of my doctor's ethic ability I would question everything about them.  That just doesn't sound like a good idea for my own health and I would be way more stressed out.  I trust my doctor because to me it's the best option.
1	I trust my doctor to what is the right thing to do for me. He has treated me for so long and never done anything to misuse his trust. I feel confident he will make the best decisions for me and my long term health care. 
-1	"I don't feel as though a personal relationship of any sort has been established over time and his ""bedside manner"" is curt and distant. I sometimes feel as though I am just another task of the day to get over with as quickly as possible. I do think I need special attention, but become discouraged with I feel that our time is rushed or treated as entirely insignificant. "
-1	I do not have a primacy care physician, but I do feel that not all humans are perfect. As such, not all doctors are going to be perfect either and can either make mistakes, or purposefully mislead a patient for personal reasons.
-1	My current physician has taken me very seriously and been open about all the options, however, past physicians have not at all
1	I trust my doctor because who else can I trust.  It leaves me no choice but to trust my doctor.  I can always decide later whether I believe it's a good advice or not.  
1	I trust my doctor because he is always upfront and honest. He takes the time to actually listen to my concerns and takes into consideration my opinions about my health. He works with me to get the kind of medicines that I also will approve of taking instead of giving me medicines that I believe are more dangerous for me to take. He seems very trustworthy and honest. 
1	Being a nurse has helped me see doctors in a different way. There are some doctors that have proved to me that I can trust them and there have also been some doctors that have been deceitful to their patients. If a doctor is honest with me and spends time talking to me then I can trust them. If I have a doctor that comes in the room and doesn't engage with me or sends his/her nurse in to talk to me, then I have less trust. 
-1	I like to think that most doctors know what they are doing and try to help patients and do what is right for them in their lives.
-1	sometimes things go well and other times things dont go well it just happens to be that this is how things have been lately
1	My doctor is always willing to listen to my concerns even when there are many patients out in the waiting, even though I try not to waste his time.
-1	For the most part, I trust my doctor.  He is the expert and knows what's best for me.  However, I know that doctor's are overworked and stretched thin.  I am sometimes wary that they do things that are quicker or easier.  
-1	i don't really go to the doctor that often as i am very healthy generally.  I don't feel any mistrust in my doctor but have little interaction at this time.  I would go if I needed help.
-1	I believe doctors in general do have the patients' interest at hurt and thus is why I trust my primary care physician.
-1	I do not trust my primary care doctor because he tells me that I can only present one problem I am having during a visit. I have chronic issues, and I only go into see the doctor once a year, because he doesn't order tests, or seem to take me seriously when I present a problem. So, in turn, I don't trust that my primary care doctor really cares about me, or my chronic problems, and I don't bother going in to take care of anything because he won't do anything to help me feel better. Wish I had better insurance, so I could find a doctor that was interested in helping me feel better.
1	I hardly ever see my physician, but during the times I have seen him, I feel like he listens to what I'm saying and has offered good suggestions.
-1	Recently discovered an enlarged thyroid.  My PCP ordered thyroid ultrasound but, did not order TSH level.  I had to call office and suggest this be ordered.  
-1	I don't fully trust my doctors because they're fallible and because I don't know their jobs and therefore can't know if they're truly correct or not.  But that doesn't bother me tremendously because I feel like I'm the ultimate decider on medical decisions and I'm a full participant in getting medical care.  I use the doctor as a resource, but not the final authority.  They answer to me, so I scrutinize their decisions and judgments while still recognizing their knowledge and experience.
-1	I trust my primary care physician fully because he or she needs to build a relationship with one an other to gain the trust and to feel safe.It is important to trust them because they are smart about the information and always work in your best interest for you.
-1	I am close with my doctor.  They are always in a great mood and able to talk to me in a calm manner and I can trust what they are saying and doing is in my best interest.  I think that all doctors are in the job for the right reasons.
-1	To an extent I trust my physician but it seems as if she is always rushed and just trying to get people in and out as quick as possible. Somethings that seem worrisome to me are just dismissed and not thoroughly explained.
1	My primary care doctor has been working many, many decades. He's very straight forward. My husbands sister also use to work for him, and she's called him an asshole but completely trusts him and his judgement. I feel the same way.
1	Even doctors nowadays doubt the efficiency of healthcare system advising patients not to trust physicians âany more than you trust your stockbroker (if you are ... Maybe this is the reason why many doctors are complaining on their patient's behavior accusing them of being âdifficult, nasty, obnoxious .
-1	My physician does not hesitate to tell me if there is something I should or should not be doing in regards to my health. She is frank and open with me, and displays concern when evaluating the issues I have. She often seems rushed, however, so I occasionally have doubts about how thorough she it.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have extensive training in their profession and the government makes sure they know their stuff.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, so I'd have to say the reason I don't trust doctors in general is because they always seem too busy to really listen to me, and are careful only to avoid malpractice suits.
-1	I want to trust my doctor but perhaps it's TV or just my lack of health care growing up. I have an issue with trust. I mean it seems sometime they herd you like cattle. They see you for 2 minutes then it's time to pay and leave. They offer no personal connection. I feel like maybe doctors out in the country where things go at a slower pace and people care about each other more I could trust my doctor but here in the city I don't 
1	I generally trust doctors, their abilities, and intentions. My only source of distrust would come from them seeming too busy or distracted and making mistakes.
1	My doctor is well-trained and has plenty of knowledge and experience. I have never felt like I was being rushed out the door. They always talk to me with respect, and for as long as I need.
-1	I mostly trust my doctors to tell me what is wrong and how to fix it; they don't always agree with me or me them when diagnosing something or trying to get me to take pills or treatments I don't want to take or do. I believe they are genuinely trying to help me, but we don't always agree.
1	I've been with the same group of primary care physicians for over 20 years. While the doctors/PAs change, they are always knowledgeable, current, honest, have a good bedside manor and answer any and all questions I have about any conditions, treatment options or costs. 
1	I like her because she presents all options and treatments and pros and cons without biasing me towards them and she is open to conventional and non conventional treatments
-1	I trust doctors in general because they know the right things to do in order to improve your condition. They have the right response every single time.
-1	It's obvious that my primary care physician, and all the other doctors in that office in general, is ridiculous overworked and overwhelmed.  When I do go see her, I can expect to regularly wait 2 hours past my scheduled appointment time to even see the doctor, only to have her rush through our meeting in 5 minutes and rush me out.  The waiting room for my primary care physician's office is always filled to the brim with waiting people, many of which sick and coughing.  My doctor means well but she is clearly overworked and unable to give me her best.
-1	I do not go to my family doctor often but if I had a health condition that I needed to see him more frequently, my answer might change. Sometimes I feel like doctors are in a hurry to see their next patient that they do not see completely to my needs (which there are very few).
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and she knows me.  She knows how my body reacts to certain drugs and other stimuli.  She believes what I tell her.  
-1	I do trust my doctor, but I also realize how busy he is.  I have never experienced my doctor making a direct mistake relating to my health, but there have been instances when he was rushing a little.  When I am prescribed something, I always take the time to research the drug and its results/side effects before taking it myself.  I do have faith in his abilities, but will still take the time to do my own research.
1	My primary care doctor is a family friend. He has also been my doctor for over 20 years and that I am aware of he has never lead me in the wrong direction. He might tell me something and then I will look it up and it will be what he says so therefore I tend to believe him. If I do the things he tells me to do I usually feel better.
1	i trust doctors because they know more than i do. i do not know what is wrong with me, just that something is not right. they have gone to school and received training to be able to help me, so i try to trust that they will not lead me astray. I have had mostly good experiences with doctors in the past, so i cant complain
-1	In all honesty, I do not currently have a primary care physician as I do not have health insurance. In general, I do trust the health profession however
1	I trust my primary care condition because it feels like she really cares about my health. She asks a lot of questions about any problems I have and doesn't rush to meet her next patient. She's very thorough.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is the one who went to medical school and I am not, and because I am in good health after seeing her for medical problems. All my problems have always been resolved by going to the doctor so I have no reason not to trust her.
1	I have been with my family Dr. for almost 20 years now. I know that he has my best interest at heart. 
-1	My doctor does not half ass his way just to get a job done. He actually talks to me and makes sure that I understand what is going on and what I need to do. Most physicians will look out for their patients because they are under their care and their reputation is on the line. 
-1	not forthcoming with info and seem to rush through appointments.  Also, don't seem interested in the causes of medical conditions or events.  Not interested in probing further
-1	I have two primary care physicians that work in the same facility. Generally, I trust them with my medical needs. I don't go in too often, so usually when I do go, there is a need for treatment. They are good at assessing the symptons and prescribing treatment. Occasionally, there was a need for follow up that wasn't taken care of but overall, I trust them.
-1	I feel that doctors are generally trustworthy. As human beings, they do have biases, and they do make mistakes, so it's important for patients to educate themselves, ask questions, and so on, but on average I feel people in the medical profession can be trusted to know how to do their jobs.
-1	I have confidence and trust in my PCM, but I also have to weigh his recommendations against my own philosophy of life, and compare his diagnosis to what I research online form other experts in the field.
-1	My primary care physician is more interested in prescribing medication rather than preventative care. I feel like all he ever wants to do is give me some drug other than give me better life habit talks.
1	In the past several years, I have visited and communicated with my PCP for several times. I am satisfied with the experience of each visit. There is no way to complaint at all. I also communicate with other patients and they share the same opinion with me.
-1	My primary care physician has proven himself to be reliable, knowledgeable, and if was unsure about something would admit it and find out the information. That is why I can trust him because he is willing to admit when he doesn't know and willing to find out the information. That how I know I have a good doctor because he doesn't have a god complex.
-1	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I think that medicine can be trendy and when my primary reccomends a procedure or exam that I think is unecessay I usually go with my gut feeling.  I have not taken certain test ie colonostomy for example because I don't believe the risk however so small is worth the possible pay off.  This is a procedure that is now common but I feel unecessary in most cases.
1	I feel that even though doctors are busy and rushed, and can't always possibly have enough time in the day, or in general, to give you the individualized attention you seek, they still know you depend on them. They value the importance you place on them and what they can provide, and they have a moral code that they abide by to make sure they give the best care possible. I know that doctors are also capable of making mistakes, and some doctors are better than others, but it would be an impossible task oftentimes to be able to find a doctor that would be able to give you the best individualized care and information possible in a manageable timeframe. It often feels like it's not necessary, either, as in most cases, with most people's problems, most doctors will suffice.
-1	I have known my PCP since I was born. My parents really liked him, but I never was comfortable around him. At times he would send me for too many tests and other times he wouldn't send me enough. He never seemed to care about me, just what made him feel important. The Physician Assistants in his office are just as bad, if not worse. Just recently I switched my PCP and have an upcoming appointment with my new PCP 
1	I trust my medical doctor because she is a person that has been there for me throughout my entire life and has always done everything that she can to make sure that I feel comfortable and get well as soon as possible. I know that I can ask my doctor questions about anything and everything and that she'll try her best to answer whatever it is that I want to know without any kind of hesitation. My doctor is someone that I feel will always have my best interests in mind.
-1	I changed to a new doctor last year. I have only seen him once. He seems professional and capable. On the whole, doctors have treated me effectively. But I still feel I need to ask lots of questions to make sure I understand what they are doing.
1	My husband and I are currently going through fertility treatment so my primary care physician is a reproductive endocrinologist. She has an amazing track record of helping people get pregnant. She genuinely cares about us and celebrates victories and mourns losses with us. This makes me trust her and her opinions so much more.
1	I trust my primary care physician because when I told him about my coughing and inability to breathe, he actually took me seriously, unlike the previous three. Now I have two inhalers (maintenance steroid and emergency albuterol) that help me breathe better. That's all I want from a doctor: mutual respect enough to take me seriously when I say something is a problem. (And he doesn't pathologize my sexuality, which also helps.)
-1	I have had a longstanding relationship with my primary physician. He is knowable, experienced, intelligent and open. I feel comfortable discussing my health with my doctor as he is patient, kind and wise. I do, on occasion disagree with my physician and in most cases feel comfortable letting him know of and why I might disagree with him. Some times I may not speak up, and I guess that goes somewhat under the category of distrust but all in all I do trust my doctor. As far as other doctors are concerned, my trust level is on a case to case basis.
-1	The reasons why i trust my physician is because i have known him for a while. He has always been honest with me and my care. For that reason he is my daughters doctor as well.
-1	I haven't seen my doctor very often since I've been going to him for 2 years so it's hard for me to trust him. I have seen him 4 times in the 2 years. I don't know him very well, but from past experience, doctors in general don't know it all and are humans and make mistakes. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he is willing to answer my questions even as far fetched as they might be, he takes the time to listen to what I have to say
-1	I trust my doctor. He knows much more than i do. Always explains everything, even if i don't ask. I don't think he cares more about what is convenient  for him
-1	"I generally trust my doctor to prescribe what's best for me, but not to the fullest. I have sometimes felt like I was being rushed out the door instead of them hearing me out all the way. I have an anxiety issue that comes with very frightening chest pains occasionally. I was seen for this problem and had all my labs done and my heart checked out which ruled out anything ""serious."" I was put on medication for anxiety and not really followed up with. I stopped and just did the research for myself on what's wrong with me since my doctor couldn't seem to figure out what it was beyond anxiety."
-1	Well most of the doctors I've gone to in the last 20 years work at production mills. Get the patients in, give them some drugs, get them out. Treat as many people as possible in the given time.
-1	I have a medical condition with my back that no doctor has yet been able to help with. The last doctor I saw about this had me as a patient for two years. I followed his advice, consented to treatments, and did everything as he wished it and got 0 results. At the end he decided that he didnt know what was wrong with me exactly and I stopped seeing him. It only took thousands of dollars in treatments for him to figure out that the cash cow was dry. 
1	It's not a business that has a lot of corruption or under-the-table payments, so doctors have little reason to lie or sway you in a direction that's not beneficial to you.
-1	My doctor is patient and takes the time to answer any questions I might have. I never feel rushed in his office. He also never seems pushy, and gives me all of my potential options. He's never pushed a medication or treatment on me. His bedside manner is excellent.
1	I trust my doctor to know what is right for me because she generally chooses the option that she knows will be covered with insurance and tries to get me the best treatment while also considering my financial situation.
-1	They spend so little time with patients that it's very tough to get to know a person's individual lifestyle and complete health profile. There is a lot of pressure to see many patients in a day which burdens doctors and leads them to rushed decisions.
-1	I have had concerns dismissed before without a good explanation, which is why I don't have 100% trust in my doctors, however, most of the time my doctor is willing to listen to me and provide the information that I need.
-1	I just started going to a new primary care physician this summer.  I was very impressed.  She took 15-20 minutes to just sit down and get to know me and my health history.  She seemed very knowledgeable and was very easy to talk to.
1	I have the best doctor. Recently had the flu, saw the doc and got medication. After four days my doctor called me at eight at night to see how I was doing. He treats me like family and I admire him so much.
-1	I feel that my doctor has my best intentions in mind. He helps me to feel better every day and prevents me from getting sick. I have full trust in  him.
1	My doctor has on multiple occasions spent more time with me than she had to to make sure I'm content or that she figures out what proper course of action is. If she doesn't know something she tells me and then seeks out other sources of information to help her make an informed decision.
-1	I trust my primary care physician sometimes because he's made mistakes, rushed to his own judgment, and said things to me that made me feel like he was looking out for himself rather than looking out for my needs. That said, I still use him because he's been willing to admit when he's wrong, correct his behavior, and move forward.
1	I trust my doctor since they have the ability to know and they have the perspective to know whats going on
1	I trust my doctor, although we have disagreed on the best treatment options in the past. I do not always think that a pill is the cure, while he tends to prescribe medications for everything. I do think he looks out for me though and has my interests in mind.
1	I have been working with her for a while so we've built up some level of trust. She seems very involved and concerned in my well being every time I meet with her. We go over all aspects of my care each time we meet, and she truly tries to help me solve the issues at hand. 
1	I trust our primary care physician but prefer to deal with her exclusively and not her Physician Assistants. The PA's that work at her medical office aren't quite as knowledgeable and don't provide the same level of thorough analysis required for our day to day health needs.
-1	It's just one person, and a single person can be wrong despite having good intentions. I would much rather know the opinion of multiple doctors or people with experience.
-1	I trust them to use the knowledge they have or to refer me to another who is more specilized. I would distrust if they felt they could handle all troubles.
-1	They know what's best for me. Even if they aren't totally honest about the best course of action, they still more about these things than I do.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because my questions are always answered. I feel like I. Always taken seriously no matter the situation.  When something is wrong he always goes above and beyond to figure out whatâs the matter. I always feel like I can open up about whatâs wrong and not feel embarrassed. 
-1	I recently switched to a new primary care physician and am working on building trust after a previously bad experience with my former doctor. I also have intense anxiety and distrust in general.
-1	I donât really trust my doctors completely. They tend to never give me options and just go with what they want me to do. I went in for back pain and I asked to be sent to chiropractor, but she was a firm believer in physical therapy, so denied my request and sent me to physical therapy which didnât help and she still refuses to do what I think is right for my health. 
1	My doctor has always taken the time to sit and talk with me about any concerns I have regardless of the time crunch on her part.  She will walk me through different steps to take and even calls days later to check in to see how we are doing.
1	I have been through a surgery with him and have had good results. He openly shares the good and the bad and the tough things.
1	my primary care physician is very direct and honest about all aspects of my health and well being. my primary care physician always takes the time to make sure that i know exactly what is going on and that i have all the information that i need, and that i know what all of my options are.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always been open and honest with me. She listens to me carefully and is gentle and kind and patient with me. She's fairly young as well, which I like. She's not judgmental of me
-1	I trust him because he talks to me like he really cares. He does everything with a computer so he is always looking at the screen to compare how I am at his visit and how I was at last visit. He keeps tabs on anything that has changed, he has warmed up personality wise over the years which is nice.
-1	There have been a few times I have seen my doctor with issues that seemed bad and felt unable to communicate to her how bad I felt. I often feel like she isn't really listening to me. Only to go on to another specialist type and find out she should have known how to help me with this problem. 
-1	I think that pharmaceutical companies have an unethical amount of control over doctors prescriptions and treatment methods for patients and most people are not inclined to bite the hand that feeds.
-1	I do not feel the doctors are very careful in doing exams. Sometimes they did not make the right dignosis.
1	I trust my primary care physician as they have been the primary for my entire life, he's a great doctor who is very understanding and always willing to listen and pitch multiple ways of dealing with whatever is ailing me. 
1	As I mentioned earlier, I always wanted to be a doctor growing up and I even went as far as to enroll premed for 4 full time college years before I changed my mind.  I did not do this for money.  I did this because being a doctor always appealed to me.  I like to solve problems and the human body and what it is capable of astonishes me.  I like to think that most if not all doctors got into medicine for the same reasons.  They want to build that trust with their patients.  Without patients, they have no practice so I have to believe that they are to be trusted or else they would not have gone into medicine.
-1	I am woman who has given birth twice, i know what it is like to have a doctor want to induce labor because he will be on vacation on your due date. I have had nurses deny me crutches because they didn't believe my pain level. everyone is human, just because you work in the medical industry does not make you infallible.
-1	I think my doctor is well educated and has patients best interests at heart however I also think at time her own prejudices get in the way of effective treatment.
1	I have had the same primary care physician for quite some time. He is thorough, makes me feel comfortable, and is overall a great person. There's not a time when I'm at his office where I do not feel safe and at ease. He has never steered me in the wrong direction either. 
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because he is a friend of my family, and also my in laws. He asks how family is doing.  He is knowledgeable about any issues brought up, and is open to discussing all options available.  He is friendly and kind.  I don't feel that he is ever in a rush to get out of the appointment, and move on to other patients.
-1	No matter how disinterested my doctors have seemed sometimes, I still have faith in their expertise to provide me with the right evaluations. Even though you get treated like a piece of furniture in healthcare clinics, the doctors are still good.
-1	I don't really trust them and find myself changing and getting second and third opinions all the time. I feel like the doctors don't really pay attention to what I am saying or use their head to think of outside the box ideas. Basically I tell them how I feel and they agree, they don't ask or think of ways or things my pain could be from. I could say that I feel like a horse and they would give me horse pulls.
-1	My issue is less a trust of the doctor themselves, and more of an institutionalization of thought. There are other ways to heal/treat people than what is typically catered to in a hospital, although a Doctor may not always be aware of them.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because we went to the same school and he seems like an honest and reasonable guy that I feel that i can relate to. He understands that i have a good knowledge of my health
1	I trust my doctor. I have my reasons for this. I trust my doctor because he will listen to me when I have questions that I need to ask. He is very generous and makes me feel like I'm important. I've been seeing my doctor for years now and never have I felt that I could not talk to him. I've been quite worried about a lot of things in the past and he has assured me that I was going to be alright.
1	My doctor has never given me conflicting or incorrect advice from what I can tell. He always spends a long time with me making sure that I have all concerns addressed. He is professional and courteous and I appreciate his work and attention.
-1	I trust my doctor in that I trust him or her to not harm me in any way. But in a world of referrals, its often easier to ship me off to a specialist and still charge me, then to actually do things that will help me. Sometimes a specialist can be the right call, and sometimes its just convenient for the doctor.     
1	She takes a great interest in listening to my concerns and questions. She tells me that I am in charge and that she is here to help me make the best decisions. She lets me know that she is determined to help me get well. 
1	 My primary care physician at this time is very patient and open to explaining things to me in ways I can understand.   She takes the time I need to make sure I am comprehending what she's explaining.   I feel safe asking her anything. 
-1	Doctors go through so many years of schooling and training and they are so knowledgeable you have to trust them.
-1	I feel that many doctors are overworked and don't necessarily care about wellbeing of patients.  They are also at the mercy of insurance and pharmaceutical companies.  It is a sad day, because I remember when it was the other way around and doctors did what was best for their clients.
1	My experience with my primary care doctor has been positive. She has not tried to push unwanted medications on me and she tells me exactly what she is thinking.
-1	Regarding doctors in general (I haven't seen a primary care physician in many years), I feel like I can trust them somewhat. As I've gotten older though, I think I've become more skeptical about doctors, knowing that, for example, doctors get a higher kickback on certain drugs or treatments than others, so there is a benefit to them to get you to take a particular treatment option. I still trust doctors in diagnosis, but treatment I'm more skeptical. 
-1	Doctors want money and they often push information they are being paid for, like from pharmaceutical companies and whatnot. I really don't know if my doctor knows what is best for me because of all the alternative medications and practices I can read about online. I don't put too much into what my doctor says as they have limited information from their medical school studies.
-1	I am assigned a dr through the military and dont really have a choice. I advocate for myself and only see them when sick.
-1	I've had several physicians over the years.  Most of them have always been trustworthy.  For example, I was taking ambien for many years for insomnia, and because my doctor truly had my best interest, she stopped filling my script and we opted for a different drug that was less addictive.  I have developed a lot of trust with her.
-1	TRUST A LITTLE BECAUSE THEY ARE DOCTOR'S AND PRETTY SURE THEY DONT WANT TO BE SUED, SO THATS WHY I TRUST THEM. BUT SOMETIMES I DONT BECAUSE THEY JUST MIGHT BE DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.
-1	I do not see my primary care doctor very often. I feel like my once a year checkin is not enough for me to build a relationship. 
1	I have a very high level of trust for my primary care physician. I have been seeing him off and on for over a decade now, and he has never been anything but polite, helpful, and understanding. Every time I have an appointment with him he makes sure all of my needs are met and that all of my questions are answered right there. I am very satisfied.
1	My primary care doctor is great - she is very direct and straightforward while also being friendly and pleasant. She does not sugar-coat and is open to my getting second opinions, and she is happy to answer all of my questions (I bring lists). She never seems rushed.
1	I have to trust my doctor because who else would I turn to when I have a medical  problem. If I don't trust my doctor, I would never check if I have a terrible disease and I could possibly die because of that. Basically, I trust my doctor because of necessity. 
1	I do not have a primary care physician, but I have been to the doctor a few times in the past couple of years. Every time I have gone, I have been treated with respect, and the doctor has been honest with me every single time. I have no reason to distrust doctors in general, based on past experiences I have had with doctors. I have always gotten better when following a doctor's advice.
1	My doctors saved my life and I don't believe that 99.99% of doctors would give their patients anything but their best advice and information.
-1	I distrust my primary care physicial somewhat because their primary obligation might not be to me, but instead to their career and their financial obligations.  Plenty of doctors have plenty of lawyers to offset complications of medical errors and other eugenicidal malfeasance.
1	I trust my doctor because I feel like he has my best interest and wants the best for me long term in my health.
1	I trust my doctor because she always lets me know the truth. Even though she tries to make me feel comfortable, she gives me the negative effects and tells me the truth about what can happen to me if I don't take care of myself.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 7 years and still to this day have never seen him I have only seen the physician assistant.  She does a great job but I think its funny I have never seen him
-1	I have little trust in doctors because in me experience, they have been very money orientated. They schedule more and more appointments, not because they care about you, but how much your insurance will pay them for each visit.
-1	A doctor just does not have time to provide a high level of service to every patient, even if they are motivated to do so. They are also subject to fatigue, influence from drug manufacturers, and biases. Sometimes their knowledge can be outdated, if they are decades into their career, or too green, if they are brand new doctors. 
1	I have a military doctor, and I always think that being in the military, you can't always mess up things and you always think about the servicemember, and not your own self or convenience.
1	My primary care physician is the primary care physician for my grandparents, parents, aunt and uncle, brother, and cousins, and my cousin's wife was a nurse in my physician's office for several years. I've known him for more than twenty years, and my parents have known him for longer. He's always done his best with all of us, and he's always been kind and funny. I have no reason not to trust him.
-1	Most doctors have the best in mind for you. I usually trust most doctors and because I can often understand what is going on, I can agree or disagree and understand rationale because of my health care background. Very rarely do I find a doctor that I don't trust at all, if at all. Sometimes they aren't the most thorough, but if I feel the need to tell them to assess something, I will. I keep open communication and talk with them frequently, especially in the patient room and clarify things that I don't understand or need more explanation. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he always listens to me and my concerns.  They have always been good at diagnosing and treating my illnesses.  They also make sure my prescriptions are always available for refills if necessary.
1	My primary care physician takes the time not only to examine me for whatever I am there for, but also spends time asking questions of how things are going for me in general.  If she cannot answer a question I have she will refer me to the appropriate person.
-1	I have a new doctor that I do not know very well. She is very friendly and seems competent. However, I would still ask questions to be sure that the right decisions were bring made about my health. I would never just blindly trust my doctor without understanding the information.
1	We selected our primary care physician based on a recommendation from our daughter after we moved. We have been completely satisfied with the family practice (my wife and I have different doctors in the practice). From day one, I got along well with my physician. We bonded, I think, partly because I was teaching at his alma mater (after retiring from my full-time position elsewhere). He will lay out various treatment options in a fair and unbiased way and leave the decision to me. Have never ever felt rushed. He takes the time that is necessary and we also toss in a discussion of sports, which is fun and makes me feel very comfortable (especially compared to some snooty specialists I have met over the years).
-1	Doctors some times are required to focus on the bottom line and cost cutting rather than the well-being of patients. They do not necessarily want to do this, but in order to make a profit, they may have to. For instance, they may prescribe prescription drugs that are not necessary in order to bring in more of a profit. They may also give unnecessary tests in order to bill insurance companies. 
-1	I generally trust my doctor but sometimes I think he just does what is easy and convenient rather than what is necessarily best for me. I feel pretty good overall about trusting my doctor.
-1	I trust because he has been very effective in his diagnosis. His advises has always been for my better health. He is seriously concerned about my well being.If I have a medical problem, he always clearly makes me understand the situation in very simple layman language. 
-1	I trust the doctors to do what is best for me and to provide access to the right treatments, but I wish that everything is laid out and simplified.  I would like to just be told of the long term survival rates instead of having to wonder.  I hold myself back from that because i don't want to know.
-1	I've recently switched doctors and only seen the new one once so I haven't formed a real solid opioion yet, but so far she seems nice and interested and takes her time and listens when I talk so far all is good. Time will tell. 
-1	i trust my doctor he has always been there for me and let me know everything that i need to know and explains it to me so i understand it 
-1	"i dont have a close relationship with my dr because im relatively healthy. So i only see her once a year. I dont even think she really remembers me. I think she just does a cursory job at my physical. I have had one health problem recently (gall bladder) she just said ""have it out"" she didnt discuss any other options she just referred me to a surgeon."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I can talk to them and they will be honest. However, they are still busy and will push me off if I let her.
-1	"I trust my primary care physician because she is thorough. There is no ""t"" uncrossed or ""I"" undotted. She asks all of the necessary questions and has a great bed-side manner. So, by being thorough and caring I completely trust her."
-1	I just don't feel there is enough time. My MD books a lot of patients and is cognizant of the time and need to be quick. I don't often get a chance to sak all my questions.
-1	I have never had a reason not to trust my doctors.  I'd rather give them the benefit of the doubt.  
-1	My doctor has never been judgemental with me when I'm in her office. She encourages frank and open conversations and she's been able to clarify several situations for me and always seems to be able to answer my questions or check on it if she doesn't know the answer. I really value that transparency. 
-1	I have been to many different doctors and a lot of them have told me that there have been things wrong with me that there were proven to not be. I was diagnosed with something then I went to a specialist that completely disproved the other doctors diagnosis. In my belief the doctor who originally diagnosed me was just trying to get more money from me and have me pay for treatment for a problem that I didnt even have.
1	With the info you give them and the info they have a round then you can stand back and trust then that they are looking out for you
-1	I distrust some physicians because they are being paid by drug companies. On top of this they often receive a specific training that I may not agree with. Due to this I am more likely to want to see a holistic or alternative physician that I would trust would be open minded like me.
-1	I don't really have a primary care physician but I did see an orthopedist last year.  I kind of felt that his wish to go through with the surgery made it more difficult for me to get him to talk about what my prognosis would be if I didn't have the surgery.
-1	Sometimes i feel doctors are so jaded by patients that they dont really take the time to listen and respond.
-1	I feel that the doctor has too many uncertain opinions at times. They run a practice and go by what you tell them and form opinions. However, some things they do know and i give them credit for.
-1	I havent been seeing my primary care physician for too long so it is very hard to gauge my level of trust in her. She is competent but, she lacks warmth. Im not sure I will continue seeing her
1	because mt dr tells me every detail and leaves nothing out. he is straight forward yet compassionate and carindg, and listens to all i say to hm
-1	I feel that doctors only want to run a lot of tests to make money or over fear of being sued. Doctors are normally very busy and rushed and do not give patients the time and care that they should. I am distrusting of doctors.
1	I trust my primary care physician because of how long i've known him. he's always welcoming and calming and i've he's always been honest with me and answered all of my questions.
-1	I don't put total trust in any man, but for the most part I have a good relationship with my doctor and have been open with her.  We discuss treatments together and i can bring to her new treatments to discuss and together we decide. 
-1	The main reasons I trust my primary care physician is because they have been trained to deal with health issues and give helpful advice. I would only distrust advice about medication with side effects.
-1	Overall I think my primary care doctor is thoughtful and knowledgeable and wants what's best for me. I do think it could be possible that she might miss something that could be wrong and I also don't know that she has the time to stay up on all of the latest treatment options. 
1	I like her. I don't know her for very long but she follows up and does what she says she is going to do. She seems trustworthy so far. I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. She seems to care about her patients.
-1	I have trust in my primary care physician because is always straight forward and makes an effort to guide me to make good decisions and helps me weigh all different options that I have.
1	I trust my primary care physician because they always listed, answer my questions, and never seem to rush thru the appointment. If something is wrong, they always make a follow up phone call.
1	I like to think they do the job in order to help me feel better. Admittedly, I have felt a little rushed in a busy office, but I have never felt like they were deliberately being careless. I think they have my best interests in mind, even though I have had some unsuccessful treatments. I think this is a problem of specialization, as some GP's do not have the in depth knowledge to treat specific medical issues. I trust my GP with my overall health in the end.
1	I trust my doctor at the VA because he is very thorough and if I don't ask enough or the right questions about things, he will start asking me relevant questions about what is going on with me. Things that I have complained about in the past, he will also cover with me to be sure that those issues have been addressed as well. Any test that is needed he will order and follow through to be sure that everything is up to date as needed.
-1	Sometimes I feel I want to trust what she says but other times I feel like she's not even aware of my problems. She tends to focus on things that don't need to be done versus helping me with my true problems. I feel she is overwhelmed with other things and patients and I am just a number on a chart and not a real person.  
1	I trust my physician because they were the one able to get certain medical conditions under control while previous doctors have not. I have gotten better while under their care.
-1	Sometimes my doctor give medicine in cases that are unnecessary and set up for appointment after appointment for no reason.
1	"My Dr. is very attentive and willing to talk to you if you have questions. he never pushes any ""drugs"" and always seems to be willing to help you not come bck to his ofice. He is personalble and isdedicated to huis patients. He once saw me without an appointment (ona busy day) because I had no other day in which I could return. "
-1	I think that a doctor can make mistakes and sometimes it is easier to hide it from the patient. I have family members that work in a hospital and I already heard many stories that makes me worried about it.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for over 15 years and he always treats me with kindness and respect.  He will take the time to explain things to me in detail and help me decide the best route to take in my care.  He never rushes the visit and this makes me feel I can trust that he has my best interest at heart.
1	Mostly thinking of my pediatrician, but she has proven herself as knowledgable and deeply caring about our situation even though she is overwhelmed by other patients at the time.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he knows what he is doing, afterall, he did go to medical school. He has never given me a reason not to trust his judgement.
-1	I think that for the most part, my doctor will recommend what is best for me. However, there are times when the office is very busy. At those times, I do not always feel as though my doctor is fully listening and may be in too much of a hurry for me to feel confident in his recommendations.
-1	My physician sometimes waffles or backtracks, which causes me to suspect her judgment on occasion. She has more than once recommended a certain treatment and then at a follow-up exam, has made statements about the treatment which caused me to wonder whether she actually believed in it or not. I do realize that doctors are just people, and sometimes not even terribly intelligent or competent, so I've trained myself to expect not quite so much from them as others may. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because we have had a successful patient-doctor relationship for about 5 years now. She has been open and honest about my condition and whatever treatment plans we may pursue for specific conditions. She tells me about the benefits, the side-effects, and what she thinks may be best for me. She also welcomes my input and will change our treatment plan based on what I tell her. I feel that I can tell her anything.
-1	The primary care physicians I have dealt with are overworked and unable to completely focus on one case at a time. That is the nature of health care today for all but the very rich. This is just the way it is. I feel responsible for knowing and researching as much as I can for my own good. 
-1	In my many years of dealing with people I have never found one I really trust to any great extent, certainly not with my life.
-1	I recently had to change primary care doctor's because the one that had been my doctor for many years retired. The new doctor that I have does not seem that dependable. As a matter of fact, I am in the processing of finding a different one.
1	I trust my primary care physician as I have gone to him for many years and he has always been honest and upfront about any problems or procedures that needed to be done.
-1	Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I never put full trust in doctor's because they are human. They don't know everything and I always question.
-1	My doctor used to really care about her patients.  It seems as though her practice has gotten way too busy and now she doesn't take the time she used to with her patients.  This makes me distrust her a bit.
-1	For a majority of my checkups they have constantly been meager issues that normally do not require a giant leap of faith. They are there and paid to help people I do not see how there's any opportunity to be malicious of any sort considering they're paid well, receive salary and must have some sort of love for their career path. Not to mention every single time I've ever gone to visit my primary care physician they have always assisted me no matter what and been effective each time.
1	Whenever I have had a question about my care, my doctor has always been forthcoming and honest about potential treatment plans and side-effects to prescribed medication.  
-1	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part, He does what he can to help me when I come to him with a problem. But one time when I suspected I had a ear infection coming and he said it was my neck. Few days later I had an infection
1	"I use a NP as my primary physician. She is awesome. She spends more time with me than other Doc's do and I never feel ""rushed"" through an appointment. She gives me as much time as I need when I see her. "
-1	I know most doctors are in this career for themselves and they'll prescribe high paying medications to profit. There are plenty of times when a doctor tries to rush the patient so they can go from one to the next without a proper diagnosis.
1	Iâve been seeing Dr Lewis for 11 years. Heâs very direct and to the point but also understanding and has compassion for what he does. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he has the experience to heal me whenever I am sick. I am not as informed and train as him, so I trust him tremendously. Also, he can examine me through scans and prescribe medicines.
1	My doctor is always very thorough when I see him. I've never had any issues with him, like being misdiagnosed or given a medication that I reacted badly to. I've generally had a positive experience with my current primary care physician. I trust that he knows what he is doing. 
-1	It is easy to trust a doctor if they are willing to give you time to talk to them.  Many doctors are in and out so quickly that it's had to even get an impression of them.
-1	I usually go to the poor clinic and the doctors there are terrible. The one I saw the most was checking information on his phone to make sure he knew what to do with me. I had no trust in his judgment I got better by checking Internet and finding a cure myself.
1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind at all times. I don't feel that I have ever experienced health care that had other intentions at heart. 
1	I trust my doctor because I have known him for years, and he has cared for me the to the best of his ability.
1	I am a very health individual, so I do not go to the doctor's very often; but when I do her recommendations seem appropriate and well-thought out.
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because I have been with him for years, and we have developed a very realistic relationship. He has always been very honest with me in regards to my health, even if he knows it's not something I want to hear, and he portrays how much he cares during our visits. 
-1	I think he's okay; my main thing with him is he always wants to send me to a specialist. I know myself, I am not going to make 14 different appointments to get a PAP, a colonoscopy, a mammogram...it's just too much hassle. I would rather have all my health checkups done at one place. He does listen, but doesn't delve into things, like I take wellbutrin and I'm not sure that is the solution but he doesn't ask me about or recommend anything else. He's a nice guy, I'm just not overly enamored of him but it's too much work to find another Doctor. 
-1	Doctors I like in general, because I feel they honestly want to help others but they have to rely on what they are taught. What they're taught generally doesn't align with my health goals however. I generally expect doctors to prescribe medication of some sort for whatever the ailment might be. I can't trust any decisions that involve me taking medication. If doctors prescribed particular foods and natural things that could remedy the ailment, I may feel differently about trusting their decisions.
-1	I have very mixed feelings when it comes to this. I sometimes feel that they are genuinly worried about what is wrong when on the flipside I have had moments where I feel that they are just trying to make it through appoinmtnets or just make quick money. 
-1	I lost trust in past doctor's because it became completely obvious that they had taken on too many patients and their time and attention lacked because of it. They started to care more about the money than anything else. I left that doctor and moved on to the one I am with now. I feel like she cares more about what I have to say, but she also kind of rushes through things. She just opened her practice so i'm afraid with time, she will get worse and not care as much anymore. Sometimes it seems like it really is all about the money with doctors. They are a few that really do care though. My kids' pediatrician is a great doctor and I wouldn't want them going anywhere else. I've met more doctors that didn't seem to care than doctors that really do seem to care. 
-1	He always seems busy and does not provide enough details face to face. Depending too much on his staff instead of providing personal care.
-1	Because A lot of Doctors have been known to false diagnose a person Blacks are high in that trick.  Example tell someone black they have a lump then who are they to know the future. They say you need to take Chemo therapy we THINK!!! its Cancer. Lies. Then 2 months later they Die. Secretly murdered by a Doctor
-1	It is someone that I have been seeing for quite some time.  If he does something wrong I think its just from lack of knowledge.  There isn't a lot of time to be spent with each patient.  
-1	I believe that my primary physician is completely capable and competent to execute his duties well. I do not doubt my doctor's conclusions.
1	So far everything that my doctor has told me has been one hundred percent open. He hasn't hidden anything from me or told me half truths. I have a lot of trust in him and don't have any kind of doubts of what he tells me. I follow everything what he says. My doctor also answers any question I have, whether it be a dumb one or not. He always answers my questions to the fullest of his ability. I feel I can continue trusting him in dealing with my health. That is why I trust my doctor in whatever he tells me.
-1	In general, doctors do not spend enough time with patients to get the WHOLE story, and sometimes a little tidbit of information that the patient might not seem to think is pertinent can make a diagnosis or a more appropriate treatment.
-1	Doctors are paid to tell you what they think you want to have done.  They don't really care about what is best for you, they want you to do what is going to make them the most money.  They are also paid by pharmaceutical companies to push certain drugs on you that you probably don't need.
-1	I trust him to an extent, I mean i do go to him because he knows more about my body and what could be wrong with it, however he is pretty fresh out of school so he still lacks experience.
1	i trust my primary care physician because when i see her she calls personally to give me my test results and after and before examinations she always asks a ton of questions about my health to make sure that I'm healthy and i understand everything she said and the things we discussed
-1	I have never really had a regular doctor, so I've never really gotten to know one very well. The doctor I have currently I like a great deal. I trust her decisions and she is very kind and explains things very well. I have only seen her a handful of times though.
-1	I've only seen her a couple times but she seems really nice but I'm not sure how thorough she is. They are busy so who know how much they actually think about each patient
-1	she is more than willing to answer any questions, and seems like she knows her stuff, thought I feel like she could care more for me, spending more time when I visit.
-1	Well i think i have to trust him because he knows what he is doing. I think I'm kind of safe trusting him and his methods. 
1	My primary care physician has been very effective in treating my present health issues to such an extent that my condition has greatly improved in a remarkably short period of time. Of course, I played a role in following the instructions; it is, after all, a cooperative effort. Her guidance and approach has been first rate.
-1	They make their choices baswd on their best knowledge. Sometimes they can be wrong. I only put complete trust in God.
-1	In general, I see doctors as people doing a job. A PCP does not usually have deep knowledge about whatever specific problem you're having, but they are able to refer you to a specialist who can possibly help you if you need it. PCPs are basically drug dealers for the pharmaceutical companies.
1	I trust his expertise when it comes to health and what he has to say to me. Normally doctors have a great degree of training and experience. Now and then they may mess up but it is rare. My particular doctor i trust very much and he would always be honest with me.
-1	I trust my doctor enough to be able to accociate basic common symptoms and figure out the a good approach to taking care of those symptoms. I do believe the pharmacist have a much better understanding the scripts that they write out.
1	I always trust my doctor because there is no reason not to. She went to many years of school to do what she does, and she took an oath. She looks out for my health.
1	I trust my primary care physician because if I didn't, then who else would I go to. In general, to me, it is very important to trust in the people who take of you, especially doctors who have done their job for a very long time. I trust mine because I know she has the best interest of my health and in helping me out when I need it.
-1	For the most part I trust that my doctor has my best interest in mind.  But I also know that I am one of many patients for him.  He is often following the protocols that he has to follow and does not know me as well as I know myself.
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for 15 years.  Over this time I have built trust in his diagnosis and treatment options.
-1	I trust the doctor will help me make the best decision for my health. However, they are human and have feelings sometimes that influence their opinion. 
-1	I had a couple of negative experiences with doctors, but overall my experiences have been very positive. My doctor is very thorough, takes time to answer questions and discuss concerns, and never made me feel like I was being rushed, or like a number.
1	I love my Primary Care Physician. I had been to a ton of doctors and was miserable. I saw her twice and she figured out what had wrong with me for a long time. One medication completely changed my life. She saved me. I trust her completely. But doctors in general, I only half trust them. You never know when you get a screwy one. 
-1	I don't trust my current psychiatrist. I changed to him for the convenience of his location to my home as opposed to the 1/2 hour I spent trying to get to my other psychiatrist's office. So I changed doctor's for medication management. The doctor called my pharmacy, found out the medications I was currently on, and prescribed those to me. He does not ask me how I feel when I see him or anything really about my life like my last psychiatrist. I don't feel like I am anything other than an insurance payment to him. 
1	I trust my doctor completely because he has always been honest with me and always helped with any medical problems that come up. Also because you can call him at any time and he will come to the office to help any patient that needs it.
-1	While I do think that the current health care system puts too much importance on volume of patients seen per day, overall, doctors want to contribute to healing their patients and making sure they are as healthy as possible.
1	I don't have a primary care physician but generally trust doctors. Most doctors, I believe, go into their profession because they are interested in helping people. Still I am sure to research treatments outside of my time at the doctor's office. Even when doctors are perceived as trustworthy, I think it's important to be informed and proactive in your treatment.
-1	I mostly trust my physician, but I also do my own research just in case anything went amiss, after all, it's our own body, and we should do most of the jobs taking care of it
-1	I trust my primary physician to do her best but no one is perfect and everyone has flaws, so I don't completely trust her because she can make a mistake due to human error.
-1	I trust my doctor because I see him every day at work, and we have a friendship outside of work. If you can't trust someone at happy hour, then where can you trust him? Especially when it comes to doctors. 
-1	I feel slightly distrustful of them because they need to push certain diagnosis and drugs and are overworked and overbooked.
-1	I trust my doctor because she genuinely seems like a good person, based on my past interactions with her. Though, between you and me, I wish she'd check my man parts during physicals like my old male doctor did.
-1	Well in general I do not trust people. But overall I trust what he is saying. I will get a prescription if I must on his recommendation. I will go see him from time to time to check up. But I don't believe everything sometimes I take my own advice as well.
-1	Thus far the recommendations of my Dr.(s) have been a positive and appropriate. I had a condition a few years ago and my OB-GYN recommended I start a daily medication. I don't like to take medications if I can avoid it but after following his advise my health improved and I have not had any problems with this condition in 2 years. 
-1	He gives it to you straight.  Very thorough. Sometimes he is took much about treating the symptom rather than solving the real problem causing the symptom. He is open to alternative medicines.
-1	"Other than those who wish others did not think I do not know what trust is.  I have severe problems with medical professionals as with all fields and would never trust anyone in any ""position"".  The idea itself upsets me."
-1	I trust him because he is qualified. HIs advices in the past have been good for me. I have benefitted from listening to his advices.
1	I expect most doctors, especially ones I have carefully chosen to see, to be an expert in their field, to know what they are talking about. Most people go into situations thinking this about doctors. I am generally trusting of the doctors that I see, unless they give me reasons to not think this.
-1	I do trust my health care provider enough to hear their advice and opinions, but i truly like to do some added research based off the doctors suggestions to feel more secure in my choice/decision 
-1	I don't have a PCP. I  have no insurance so I have to visit clinics and see different nurses, almost never a doctor. I can't think of a time I've seen a doctor. I generally trust the nurses because the conditions I've had are fairly simple to treat. I went in knowing I needed some kind of antibiotic so it was easy to trust the diagnosis. 
1	For the most part I trust my primary care doctor. Sometimes I feel like she is guessing and not really making an effort to help my situation. It seems like a lot of trial and error. I trust that she is getting the most current information to pass along to me. She is usually quick to respond to message also.
-1	I generally trust what the doctor says.  Sometimes I have doubts because I spend so little time actually talking to them I feel like they dont have a complete picture of me and my problem.
1	My doctor has my best interest at heart. Why wouldn't she? If she did something that would cause me harm, she would get in trouble and potentially sued. She is a doctor because she cares about people and wants to help them.
-1	My mother is a doctor. I love my mother very much, but I realize that doctors aren't magicians, and they are very much people too. I see her run short on patience for her patients---I see how things like drug seeking behaviour make her suspicious of many patients. I think many doctors probably feel this way, and it makes me wary of trusting them. 
-1	EVERY altercation I have had with a doctor, I have felt like they aren't really listening to me. They will look at their clip board and nod their head and stuff, but not actually hear what I'm saying. If they ask me a question and I don't answer it the way they think, they will say I'm lying. I dislike Doctors so much because they ALL just do the bare minimum and don't treat people like humans, but as another task before lunch break. 
-1	They are highly educated so I trust them, however, anyone can have a bad day where they don't do their jobs well.  Doctors are no exception to these rules.  They some times are going to make bad calls and so I can't 100% trust any doctor.
1	I have no reason to believe that they do not care about their work and patients. There would be no reason for them to choose such a demanding career if they did not care. They also would have no reason to self sabotage their career. 
-1	I don't think that my doctor hears what I am saying all of the time.  I also feel like the answer to everything with him is a new medication.  I would prefer to try and solve health issues without medication first.
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because I have gone to them before about an issue and they could not give me any answers, years later I went to a specialist and they were able to tell me what it was immediately. I kind of think my doctor is incompetent and doesn't care for me much. I also think a lot of doctors are just there to make money and only recommend medications that sponsor them. 
-1	I feel like doctors don't treat you as a person, they treat you by how they judge you when you first come in. They already have you figured out and they won't listen to you no matter what they say. 
-1	Its not so much a matter of Trust or Mistrust.  It's not black and white like that.  Its about enhancing and verifying information.  Just because I verify a doctors findings through my own research doesn't mean I do not trust them.  I'm um....Intuitive.
-1	A primary care physician is a physician who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis. Since recently, the term is primarily used in the United States. In the past in the US and still in the United Kingdom (and in many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is general practitioner.
-1	I dont always trust doctors because I feel like sometimes they just want to give us medicine without being sure what's really wrong.  They also rarely give ideas to help before giving the medicine.
1	I trust my PCP a lot. He has been my PCP since I was a teenager. My family have always used him and we kind of feel like his is a friend of the family. He isn't, but it feels that way. He hasn't ever led us wrong and even prevented my father from losing his foot at one point.
1	I've had the same doctor for 16 years, and so far he hasn't given me any reason not to trust him. I have been extremely healthy for all of those years too though so he hasn't had much of a chance to be wrong. Overall I'm comfortable with him, and feel like he does a good job.
-1	My PCP is too nonchalant about my medical conditions and has ignored my high blood pressure in multiple appointments. He is also fat and diabetic, so...
1	I trust my primary care physician for 100%. We have a relationship for 3 years now where I have been through some health problems. She has always helped me on a basis of honesty and telling me openly what the options wheree. She also gave me a great deal of input in the decisions that had to be made.. 
1	I have had nothing but a stellar experience for 8 years with my primary doctor.She has gone above and beyond her duties when I have concerns, I completely trust her.
1	I have had no problems in the past with my doctor. He has always been straight forward with me and laid out the different options I have for dealing with medical issues.
1	I feel like most doctors have the patients best interests in mind.  I know some doctors are only here for the pay and try to make money any way possible but, I tend to have a lot of faith in people and trust doctors unless they give me a reason not to.
1	I have been seeing my GP for nearly twenty years, and I feel like we have a good rapport with each other. I can ask questions and offer theories and she gives them serious consideration because she knows that I am self-aware, and that I'm not not dramatic or prone to exaggeration.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for years and so has other members of my family. She has always given me the medical advice that I need and I trust her to do what is best for me. She is always open to any questions that I have and is able to explain things that I may not understand. If I happen to not understand she has no problem giving me more info. She tells me if I have any questions to not hesitate to call her. That puts me at ease if I need to call again for anything follow up questions she is there and if she is not there is always another doctor or nurse to help me,
1	I get a strong sense from my physician that he truly listens to me, wants to engage my thoughts, and has my best interests in mind. Moreover, my questions are welcome and his explanations are clear. This is why I trust my physician. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable about my conditions.  She's also a great listener and asks me thorough questions to get to the bottom of things.  I've never had a problem with her, nor have I been given any reason  not to trust her.  She gets my input before all procedures.
-1	Doctor are human. As human beings, they have their own personalities and agendas that are not entirely conducive to another persons needs or health. Therefore, their actions and advice require some consideration in the larger picture. One must take responsibility for one's health regardless of another person's opinion of your health. I guess we should all be doctors for our own sake...whether we like it or not.
1	I think they tell me my options. I rely on their experience. I have rare skin disease so most doctor's don't know much about it. I can tell by their responses if I  trust them. Example - some admit they don't  know about my condition, while some try to suggest something I know doesnât work.
-1	I really dont trust them because they never give natural remedies. They always go straight to medicine which is not good for your body. 
-1	A few years ago, my mother's former cardiologist recommended that she have open heart surgery based on faulty results of an echo cardiogram. He was also not truthful about the surgical options available either. We confirmed this first through internet research, then with a leading heart surgeon at a highly-rated cardiac hospital. The end result was that my mother did not need heart surgery at all and after twice-yearly echo cardiograms with a different cardiologist, still does not require it. I have less drastic but similar experiences in the past with doctors. Unfortunately this has given me a healthy amount of distrust for what I'm initially told. I will always research topics myself, ask many questions and seek 2nd opinions.
-1	I have experienced hospital and doctor errors so I am now far more careful.  Those errors were significant -- such as not doing a screen of the chest of my husband when he had head/neck cancer, a failure that impacted the treatment given him.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor, but I know that she doesn't know how to deal with my real life problems.  She keeps telling me to go to a counselor, but when that is not an option for your patient, you have to have other options available to them.  She has not been able to help me beyond the basic physical ailments I have.  She is not any help emotionally or able to advise me where I can get the kind of help she thinks I need.  It's a weird situation. 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for almost ten years. She usually takes the time to explain things to me and make sure I am comfortable with the decisions that we make.
1	I trust them because I know along with experience and schooling they have the know how to take care of me. I have not had a negative experience yet with my doctor so no reason to distrust them.
1	I think there are so many laws now that the doctors and my doctor are very thorough and honest. It also helps he is very kind and respectable. 
-1	I havw a new pcp because my old pcp misdiagnosed me. She did this with a couple different things. One being hep b and hep a. I do not have and she said i did. New pcp is more of a doctor feel good, meaning he prescribes anything you ask for. I feel like he just goes through ths motions. I dont trust him completely.
1	I trust my doctor because he seems very knowledgeable whenever I need to consult him.  He has been the doctor of my mother and grandparents for a number of years and has always done right by them.  I find that when I communicate clearly with him he is easy to understand and is easily able to diagnose my issue.
1	My primary care physician never makes me feel rushed when I have an appointment. She listens to my concerns and always asks if I have questions. I believe she is intelligent and keeps up with new developments in medicine.
-1	For the most part, I trust her because she is a doctor and hasn't given me reason not to yet. However... we did just switch doctors and have only seen our current doctor twice. We had to switch due to insurance coverage, but our previous doctor I had been with for 5 years and trusted completely. I hope to develop the same relationship with our current family doctor.
1	I trust my primary care physician because i have known them my entire life. I can understand some people not trusting doctors in general because it seems a lot more of them these days are just trying to make every dollar they can off of their patients. 
-1	I think they have a lot of experience. My primary care giver was in a management position at a hospital in the past so I have confidence that they will do their best to look out for me.
-1	Just a level a trust is built up when you see the same doctor for many years and he has always solved problems presented to him. My doctor has been the same my entire life. He even saw my parents when they were younger. I'm fortunate to never have experienced serious medical problems but if I did then I would trust him as getting me on the right track to getting better.
-1	I trust most of what my doctor says unless I detect that she is in a rush to get me out of there. I always do my own research to learn different options and to learn about meds before I take them.
-1	I canât say that I have complete trust in my doctor. I know my doctor cares to talk me through my concerns and issues but there have been times that I have felt that my doctor was not as talkative or seemed to be in a hurry more than other times. My doctor has at times discussed different things to try for me and told me the good and bad about the treatments and Iâve never felt that she tried to push anything on me just explaining the benefits and so forth and let me take it from there.
1	he is always friendly, upfront about anything I ask him. He always gives me an honest opinion about medications and leaves it up to me if I should take them or not.
1	I do trust my primary care physician. Mainly because she takes the time to listen to what I have to say. And responds to me as if I'm a friend and not a medical record number.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for a few years now, and have only seen my health improve during this time. I have had no reason to distrust her or feel that her opinions of me are biased in any way. She has always been open to any questions I have, and has been willing to look at a variety of options for medical issues that I have had, and adjust things based on how I feel. She'll check in to make sure that I've followed up with other appointments as necessary, and I just generally tend to feel that she really cares about her patients. I don't feel like I'm in a rush, and she always treats me like a person, not just part of her job, which I appreciate. I've also looked online and she's had good ratings from other people, as well as working with a highly rated medical group that other members of my family have gone to as well. I feel like she has the resources available to help with any treatment I may need, and has utilized them in the past when she thought some other specialist may be of more help than she is. Prior to this, I didn't have good experiences with doctors. They tended not to listen to my problems, and were quick to make assumptions. In one case, a doctor refused to listen to the fact that I believed I was allergic to a medication I was taking, and I actually ended up in the ER. This current doctor is the first one that I feel listens and is actually willing to help with any issues that I have come up.
-1	My physician is quite busy and this can lead him to be curt or even impatient when asked for options or explanations. He normally thorough in his treatment but can get antsy when asked to explain himself or to clarify something he has said. I think he assumes that people will give his schedule as much priority as he does.
-1	I always find that I have to do more research about different treatments for any ailments I might have.  I don't find that my doctor spends enough time talking to me about choices of medications or options for treatments.  I always feel rushed and that my doctor is not confident enough to recommend any treatments or anything to me regarding my health.
-1	I like my physician for yearly check ups...but have not had a thorough examination from her after 2 years.  I have very few reasons to see her outside that, but I did disagree with her on one Rx and told her I would not take it. She was fair and said it was my decision, but I am free to question if I don't agree with her. 
1	"Hard to comment on doctors in general, since I believe a lot of them don't do a lot of research on drugs and were not trained in preventative care outside of ""take this pill."" I try to seek out physicians who are also trained in natural care and prevention. My primary care doctor is Chinese with both a Chinese and US medical degree, but very unconventional. I trust what he says because my overall heath and well being has actually improved. I am 71 with very little degenerative arthritis, normal blood sugar/cholesterol and plaque-free carotid arteries. So I do trust him and the other health specialists that I see"
-1	I tend to be trusting of my primary care physician because he seems very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. It seems like he is genuinely interested in trying to help people. Not just get them in an out.
-1	I trust my primary care physician but sometimes they are so quick in seeing me that I worry about not getting all the care I actually need.
1	I like my doctor very much. He has always been good at listening to me and not rushing through an appointment. He clearly and thoroughly explains the problems and solutions that he diagnoses and makes sure that I completely understand and am comfortable with his actions..
-1	I trust my doctor and have a lot of faith in her. I like it that she is a primary care as well as internist.
-1	He is highly regarded by those close to me. A lot of friends and family use the same doctor, and have high praise for him as well. 
1	I have known him for a long time now. He has often been honest to me about my weight and that I should try harder to manage it.
-1	"It seems like doctors are more interested in seeing as many patients as they can in a day than taking time to really think about what a patient is telling them. It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor who didn't seem rushed and eager to hurry up and go on to the next patient. I think because of this they are quick to farm us out to specialists for things that primary care doctors used to be able to take care of in their own offices, and to make snap judgements about a person's condition rather than take the time to think about what else could be wrong. More and more of them will even tell you whatever is wrong is ""stress"" or that they can't find anything wrong with you, but later if you see another doctor they DO find something legitimately wrong."
-1	I dont feel like my doctor wants to talk for too long. Just that they think everything is ok or not. They do provide options for allergies though.
1	I trust my doctors because  they know more than I do about the situation, and if I express concern they explain the thinking process and differentials that they are concerned about allowing them to reach the conclusions that they do. 
-1	My previous doctor let this practice and the partner is now my doctor.  As far as I know he is dependable but I haven't actually seen him for anything.  I see a nurse practitioner when I go there and she is very nice and helpful.  The office is nice and professional so I am assuming the doctor is similar to the other characteristics of the office.
-1	I only see my primary care doctor briefly, once per year for a physical. I feel she is polite and knowledgeable, but that she is often dismissive of my concerns. I trust medical professionals who I see on a more regular basis, such as my chiropractor, because they are exposed to me more frequently. I also recently went to urgent care for a matter that my doctor dismissed and received more effective treatment from urgent care. 
-1	I trust my doctor in that he listens to my concerns and takes my suggestions into consideration. He is a newer doctor to me and knows I have been dealing with certain heath issues for a while.
1	I have had the same doctor for awhile now so i just know her really well and feel comfortable enough with her to trust her
-1	I trust him generally because he does help me a lot. but at the end of the day it is a profession and he needs to make money so sometimes i feel he is in a rush to get to the next patient. that could just be me though also he seems to quick to prescribe meds
-1	One primary reason I have lost trust in my PCP is the fact that I have had surgery for the same reason twice now within three years and really need it again.  I went to an emergency room and the physician there asked me why I had to have the same surgery so close together and I couldn't tell him.  He mentioned that it was unusual for that type of surgery.  This made me contemplate a new option when I go back for the same reason.
-1	My new doctor is usually very good so I trust him well. However, I feel that doctors in general tend to push certain drugs  even when there are better options available. For instance I have asthma and my doctor pushed a certain inhaler that was more expensive than a cheaper, better option.
-1	"I have a lot of medical conditions that I've had most of my life, but I have overlooked because my parents told me they were normal. They were not. Now that I'm talking to my doctor about them I feel as though he thinks I'm a hypochondriac and doesn't take me seriously. I've had chronic soreness my entire life. He doesn't believe me. There are a few conditions that are more ""modern"" that he just doesn't believe in. "
1	My primary care doctor has always put my best interest first. He listens to my concerns and all my symptoms makes sure I have all the appropriate test ran in a timely matter and fully explains everything to me.
1	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for almost 4 years now, give or take, and he has always been a very very truthful, and integrity based person. He tells it how it is, and he is a doctor who doesn't like to just prescribe medication and be over with it. He takes the time to sit and talk to figure out exactly what the problem is, and if some type of medication is needed or absolutely necessary he will prescribe it. Otherwise we find different ways of dealing with it or try a lower tier of medication than something that could be addictive or hazardous to health. He is a genuine doctor and I have never had any issues with him.
-1	My primary physician is fine.  But after my health catastrophe experience, where I had one of the TOP DOCs in the country and refused to do what he recommended, to my everlasting satisfaction, while my wife stood beside and cried, begging me to do what he told me to, I don't trust doctors further than I can throw them.
-1	I know that he is very busy with a lot of patients, so maybe he just jumps to a treatment that  he thinks might work. For instance, I used to have a lot of digestive issues and such, and I don't think he asked once what my diet was like. Instead, he put me on pills for depression. Don't get me wrong, I needed those as well, but looking back, I think diet had a lot to do with it as well.
-1	I have been with them through multiple appointments and issues. He looks out for what is the best for me, and I trust him and his diagnosis. He has soothed my worries and worked to make sure I am helahty. I have complete trust
1	She spends the time necessary to make sure I understand everything we talk about and about treatment options.  She herself always calls me with test results and asks if I have any questions.  She never makes me feel rushed. 
1	I trust this doctor completely.  She makes sure we get to the bottom of any problems that I am having.  She also like to rule out possibilities when faced with certain symptoms.  She is very caring, kind and listens to what I have to say.  She doesn't talk to me like I'm a child.  She explains everything. 
1	My doctor has been my primary care physician for over 20 years. Sometimes, she does seem to rush, but not often. She's been there for me through illnesses and injuries and always taken care of me.
-1	My doctors will take the time to research a problem if they're not familiar with it.  They always make sure that I have all the information needed to make an informed decision about any medical conditions that come up. I go to a doctor's office that has multiple doctors in it and don't always see the same one, so it's important to me that they look over my records and are basically on the same page as far as any care is concerned.  We live in a rural area and the doctors communicate with each other in a thorough manner.  When you are referred to a specialist they always get complete information on your condition which saves time for all parties involved.  
-1	I don't have a primary car physician.  I haven't had one in over a decade.  My doctor left the practice and I was switched to someone else without my knowledge or opinion and then they moved to a different location and 'lost' me as a patient and wasn't accepting new patients.  I've always left appointments feeling like I'd been let down in my interactions with doctors.  
-1	I really try and put faith into what they are telling me.  I have been known to challenge them somewhat if the diagnoses does not make any sense to me.
1	I trust my doctor because he hasn't really given me a reason not to. He's very receptive to what I think is wrong with me and is very thorough in explaining what I am suffering from. He also explains his choices as to how to treat and explains why my initial thought of my reason for coming is wrong without being condescending.
1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. She hasn't let me down and I don't feel like I'm not getting the care I go in for.
-1	It is not that I do not trust my primary care physician, it's just that I am not sure he is giving me the best information or just the information he gives to everyone.
-1	There have been mistakes made with my care that have resulted in a need for more medical services.  I am somewhat jaded with respect to receiving medical care.  
1	"I trust my primary care physician. He is always available via the electronic portal and will respond to me within hours, sometimes even on the weekend. Sometimes an initial treatment plan won't work, but he is always ready with ""plan B"". He also makes sure I'm on schedule with preventative care (physicals, etc.)"
1	I trust my doctor because he has always steered me right and will do his best to avoid putting me through a procedure that I don't actually need. While he could make more money doing so, he will be honest with me in telling me whether or not I need something done or not. 
-1	Well I trust them because I expect them to be professionals and know what they're talking about. But at the same time I have gotten second opinions and wouldn't hesitate to do so again in the future because it's always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.
1	I just generally trust the profession.  I believe that almost all doctors are primarily concerned with the well being and proper treatment of their patients.  There may be exceptions to that general rule but there would have to be irrefutable evidence to that effect to make me doubt the sincerity if not the competence of any physician.
-1	I have been under this doctor's care for over 10 years.  He inherited me as a patient from my previous physician, who retired. I was one of his first patients and we have become friends.  I have learned to trust him, and have never found his diagnostic instincts to be in error.  He knows when to treat me for a problem, and when to leave me alone.  He is a kind human being and a good physician.
1	I had a primary care physician that I liked and trusted very much. She had me do a number of tests when I first saw her so she could see what was going on. She is always listened and answered all questions I had, she had a caring personality, non-judgy. Sadly she moved and I am currently looking for a new primary care physician. 
1	I trust my primary care doctors because he has always been straight with me. He listens to me and answers all of my questions. If he doesn't know he finds out and tells me later.
-1	Like I stated in the earlier essay question, in my experience with health care professionals (doctor's moreso than nurses), they tend to either ignore or downplay my questions and concerns. This angers me because I'm intelligent and I am great at researching, so I believe that my questions and concerns are well-founded and based on facts.
-1	I trust my PCP because she is fairly thorough.  When I explain to her that I have a specific medical concern, she does what she can to address it.  If I ask for a test or procedure, she does whatever she can to make it happen, which helps to allay my fears.  She makes appointments for me in a timely fashion, and she seems to actually care about my issues.  That's not to say she isn't usually in a hurry, but I think most doctors are because of a large patient load.
1	I trust my doctor. He tells me whats going on in a straight forward manner. He explains anything I do not understand and answers any other questions that I may have.
-1	I distrust my PCP because doctor's today have to think first about appeasing insurance providers and covered procedures in a health insurance policy as opposed to what is best for the patient. As a result of this I don't think my Doctor's word can be trusted.
-1	I have a doctor that will really listen to me and will sit an evaluate my situation and symptoms with me while explaining everything.  She is great at making me feel like she really cares and tries so hard to do what's best for me and figure out the best treatment plan for me. 
-1	There have been times where I don't think he payed full attention to what I explained to him, then had me do tests that were incomplete only to redo them again the next time when they failed to find anything. This ties in with my belief that he is rushed and therefore I feel rushed as well.
1	My doctor always tells me their opinion and their level of confidence. They give me options if they are available.
-1	I have been going a long time and always get the help I need. My doctor goes over options with me and takes the time to explain things.
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part but they aren't the most open minded when it comes to alternative therapies.
-1	I don't know my primary care physician very well, so have developed complete trust in her. She's new to me, as my previous physician left for a job in another community and no longer is in my insurance network. Therefore, I am back to rebuilding trust in a physician.
1	I have been to the doctor many times in the past and there has never really ben any issues.  I have been provided good information and treated the way I would want to be treated.  There has been no reason to not trust him in the past so I will continue to trust until proven otherwise.
-1	I feel doctors are too drug orientated and therefore I tend to distrust their judgement if it does not include alternative or natural treatments. As I have experienced a lot of success in treating my own health issues naturally without drugs I tend to refuse any advice from a doctor that relies heavily on drugs.
1	My doctor is willing to listen and doesn't ignore my concerns. She brings up different options and will let me choose which of them I think would work best for my situation. Overall, I'm very happy with my PCP.
-1	I prefer to trust my PCP because they can come up with the diagnosis of what's wrong with me and can prescribe me the right medication or other additional help that I need. They have more experience in their field and should be good at what they do. 
-1	I have advanced lung disease and I often feel that the doctor has not taken the time to really look over my files and/or learn about my condition.   For example, he recommended the Shingles vaccine for me and I had to inform him that because I am on steroids I cannot have the vaccine.
-1	My doctor is very thorough, when he makes a diagnosis he will tell you why and why not it is or isnt and what treatment he thinks will work,  He is very open about his opinions and ideas, and if something doesnt work he will quickly try a different treatment or diagnosis. Wether its something I want to hear or not, he will tell me, and provide his best opinion on how to cope with it.
1	I completely trust m doctor! She is very kind and compassionate. She always takes the time to listen to my concerns carefully. She will in turn offer her professional advice to me. She even stays around to have a few minutes of small talk when we are finished. She's absolutely great! 
-1	I think in general most physicians have their patients' best interest in mind.  They are dedicated to providing quality care.  However, some doctors may be more concerned with profits and payments from drug industries so it is important to ask questions.  
-1	"I have gone to see my doctor about trouble i am having that had nothing to do with my weight, however he will always tell me something about ""loosing weight will make you feel better"" or connect everything to my weight. I already know loosing weight will make me feel better, i have lost 81 pounds and feel alot better, but can you please just help me with the problem i actually came in for! Speaking of loosing weight, he has tried several times to convince me that i should change my diet from eating moderate protein and high fat, to something that includes more vegetables. Meanwhile when i was a vegetarian i was still pre diabetic and overweight, but now that i only eat meat i am no longer a risk for getting diabetes, as a doctor i would think he would be convinced by that proof, but he still tries to convince me i am wrig and tries to get me to take meds i don't think i need."
-1	Doctors are nothing more than amateur golfers who are also sales reps for pharmaceutical companies. They could care less about patient care and well being. They are only interested in getting you on prescription medications and having you come in to their office as often as possible while doing nothing beyond billing you and your insurance companies.
-1	I think that doctors in general have my best interests in mind when I see them for a problem that I am having. But the trouble with healthcare is that it is a for profit entity and the cost and profit side of it always comes into play.
-1	I've been seeing a D O instead of an MD for over 8 years. He use to just come in and make a few notes, get up, leave and then come back with prescriptions. Unless, I had a cold or rash or the kidney stone that one time. He believed in pushing pills. I have degenerative disk disease and have had several fusions. Since the government crackdown, he got himself (IMO) some trouble. I went to him last time and he could not believe that nobody had done an image on my lower back (no surgeries there). My point is, he's the doctor. Why should I be the one to order an image? Now, with the government crackdown, he's actually got to do his job!! I'm highly considering changing because I don't believe he is that good. 
-1	I canât get a straight answer from my doctor.  I feel that he is vague and afraid to commit to an answer. It makes it hard to trust doctors in general.
-1	I think that doctors are humans...they make mistakes. While my dr may have the best intentions, he can make mistakes too. I therefore, trust myself and how I am currently feeling and what I think is best for my body over his opinion of everyday issues that may come up. 
1	I have no reason to distrust doctors and I'm fairly confident that if my doctor did not have my best interests, and the best interests of all his patients in mind, he would not have chosen to be a doctor.
-1	My primary physician seems hurried to prescribe antibiotics over anything, and she does not like writing referrals to specialists or running tests, like the flu.  In the past Ive had to insist on seeing a specialist.
-1	All in all, I feel doctors have good intentions and generally want to help you. I don't have a primary care physician, so I can't tell you anything about that sort of relationship.
1	I trust my doctor to give me the best medical advice, as she has always been straightforward and sincere with me.   She always seems to take my overall health into account before making recommendations 
-1	I feel like I can trust my doctor to listen to me and answer my questions correctly.  However, if I forget something or don't ask the question correctly I fell like things have or will be missed.  This has happened.  I do so much of my own research before appointments I try and make sure that I pretty much already know the answers and he just confirms or corrects.
1	I trust my doctor's decisions because my doctors are trained professionals and they know what they are doing. My doctor is super nice and kind and takes time with me when I don't understand something about my health or my wellbeing. My doctor is irreplaceable to me.
-1	My primary care physician does not know me well as a person or patient. I believe I am more of a number than a patient. My doctor is quick to prescribe medication.
1	My doctor is amazing. We have a great relationship and I fully trust her to tell me the truth and to go over everything with me.
-1	I have not had a negative experience thus far. They seem to be concerned with giving me the necessary information, however, there have been occasions where they seem rushed.
-1	My GP listens to me and trusts my intelligence. He knows I don't like to take medication unnecessary medications and that I only call if something is very wrong. He's an amazing diagnostician. 
-1	I feel that it is neutral when you first meet your doctor but as sessions go on, it is very important for you to be able to talk to your doctor and for them to truly care.
-1	I trust my doctor as much as possible while realizing she is human and makes mistakes. My doctor asks open-ended questions and allows me to express my concerns openly.  She talks to me about different options I have regarding treatment.  I never feel like she is rushed or in a hurry to get to her next patient. 
-1	I don't have a regular primary care physician but in general towards doctors I do not have complete faith in them. The few times that I have had to take either myself or my child to an emergency room, the doctor completely missed something that was extremely important. Most think that you are drug seeking and ignore what could be going on. There are times I trust their judgement but I will speak up if I believe that they are wrong or not being as thorough as I think they should be. 
-1	You never really know when to trust doctors... There's the whole profit motive thing these days. A lot of them are basically drug pushers for big pharma.
-1	I trust my doctor but they are human and can sometimes get things wrong. I know they are well educated and are looking out for my best interest. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have no one else I can trust. I live a lonely life. I know that he is one of the only people that I interact with daily who does not wish to inflict some sort of harm (bodily or otherwise) on me. Doctor client privilege also makes me feel very safe with the medical staff that assist me at the hospital, so I know that anything i say can be documented in complete confidence. 
-1	"i believed all doctors Truth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard.[1] Truth may also often be used in modern contexts to refer to an idea of ""truth to self,"" or authenticity. Truth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also take on a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, and religion"
1	My doctor is very nice but also tells me exactly like it is. She does not go over board on testing, but provides what is necessary and I don't have to second guess what she is telling me. She allows me to ask questions and voice any concerns I may have and also thinks about how costly things would be for me.
1	All doctors to me should be trusted until they've done something wrong. They wouldn't be in their position if they weren't given trust to start. I'm not saying ALL should be trusted, but all should be given a fair chance!
-1	I trust my Primary Care Dr because I have been his patient for 25+ years and he knows me well. While I have never had to disagree with procedures or meds that he prescribes, I believe that if I were to be diagnosed with cancer, he and I may not agree on a treatment. Overall I do not trust most Drs. because of the government involvement and influence on things like prescrition drugs, chemo and their motives for prescribing many things.
-1	I don't like it when I go to the doctor and they can't find out what is wrong with me so they just contribute it to something else without getting down to what is causing my problems. I always thought that the doctors were there to look into things and find a cause and help to make it better, but now it seems they are only here to collect big paychecks whether they help a person or not.
-1	It really does seem like my doctor does care about me at times and it is really nice knowing that. Everytime i go in he askes how am i feeling.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because i have been dealing with them for a while and they showed and prove to me that if i just eat differently and exercise a little more i can lose weight and become healthy and i did.
1	He's very blunt, like house level blunt. he may not be polite or kind or caring, but he knows the healthcare field and medicine. He has no problem saying it how it is and doesn't fancy foot around it.
-1	Overall I don't feel alot of trust of doctors in general. The reason why I feel this way is because I feel most doctor's are in it for the money and they don't necessarily want people to be healed. They give you medicine for almost everything and that is not a good thing. So overall I don't trust in doctors and don't go to the doctors unless I have no other choice.
-1	I haven't gone to this new doctor as much and it takes time to build up trust and believing in the professional. Too many doctors get bought out by pharmaceutical companies and leave out some other medications that could help you if need be. I am not all conspiracy gung ho but I need time to build trust
-1	I feel like most mainstream doctors are in trained to only treat symptoms and not cure and heal the body as a whole. Big Pharma is a huge business and many of those doctors get incentives for keeping people coming in. Holistic doctors would be concerned with treating and curing ( and maybe  few doctors).
1	I trust my ankle surgeon because he actually screwed up a surgery.  It was not something he did as much as my body reacted poorly to the procedure.  He went step by step with me as to how to fix the problem and what lingering issues I would have.  He is always up front and direct but polite with me. 
1	I have gone to him for several years.  He tells it like it is, and doesn't sugar coat it.  When I have concerns I bring them to his attention and he discusses it with me.  I'm an overall healthy person, and see him twice per.  If I am in there outside of the every six months, he knows something is really wrong.
1	He is very thorough in running tests to make sure I am healthy.  I feel confident in his ability to answer any questions I have.  He takes the time to sit and talk directly with me about any concerns that I have.  He is very patient and I feel concerned about my well being.
1	I trust my doctor because she seems genuinely interested in my concerns when I ask questions. When there is something I need to do, she gives me options that are based in real, conventional medicine and doesn't try to brush me off by suggesting placebo-like alternative treatments. She seems cautious and checks my lab results, and will take some time to see if my concern is based on an injury or illness during an exam. If something seems like it will clear up on its own, like some pains, she will suggest contacting her office if it doesn't get better in a certain number of days or weeks. I like her style of care and her advice is almost always a good way forward.
1	I've had the same doctor for many years and I can fully say this man does truly care about his patients. He has a very good memory and understanding of what his patient's need. That is why I put a lot of trust in him.
-1	I generally trust them but at the end of the day they are they to make money and not just to help me or  to make me feel better so I have to take everything they say or recommend or do with a grain of salt and seek other opinions
-1	:I trust my primary care physician because for the most part, they have always given me reliable information. They seem to be very knowledgeable about the conditions I am facing and experienced with those conditions. The take their time in delivering the best care possible to me.
1	I generally trust the doctors that I see because I respect their knowledge and experience. This is particularly true when I see specialists about a particular condition. I have faith when seeing a specialist that they have seen many patients with my condition and that they will be able to quickly find a cure or method to manage the condition. I also try to use this opportunity to ask general questions about the condition to them, which I believe is more informative than if I searched online on my own.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I my family and I have been going to the same one for many years.  She has helped me manage many things including my blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Also she is very up to date on my medications in which I need to order.
-1	I feel very neutral about my trust towards my primary car physician. I can not whole heartedly put all my faith into them. That why I strive to get second opinions if something does go wrong. I go see a specialist in order to better understand, and make sure I am not being misdiagnosed. There have been instances when I do not believe my doctor has made the right decision such as not prescribing the right dosage of a medication, and I have struggled to come to terms with that. Until then I still go cause its a convenient location, and accepts my insurance.
-1	I don't like how Dr.s get kick backs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe meds. This makes me not trust them because they put themselves first.
1	I trust that he has my best interests in mind, he usually presents me with options for any concerns/issues I have and encourages me to do my own research into those options to ensure I can make a fully informed decision. He takes his time during our visits to explain to me what I need to know, and almost always request that I follow up with him in a timely manner to ensure I am on a recommended path towards meeting any goals/treatments that have been selected.
-1	For the most I trust my physician. I do think that doctors need to spend more time with there patients. 
-1	I trust that they care about the patients. They seem to want what is best for us and provide all the options. There are more effective doctors out there though I'm sure. They can still be wrong, or overlook something, especially if they are overworked.
-1	I think that people are often motivated by money and that sometimes doctors will not tell people the best way to take care of themselves but they will tell them what is most convenient and beneficial to themselves instead. 
1	I do not feel that my doctor has ever lied to or withheld information from me so I have no reason to distrust her. She answers all of the questions that I do remember to ask her and her answers always sound reasonable.
-1	Unfortunately, medical care in America is a business first.  I never know if the decisions my doctor is making are in my best interest or the best interest for his bottom line.
1	In my experience, with all the conditions I have gone through in my life and went to the doctor, all the information they have given me had proof that I had found out prior to visiting.
1	Mainly because I do not really need my doctor to explain to me what is going on. I can see that he gives instructions and recommendation based on current research and best practices by verifying it for myself. Unless you do this you allow yourself to be treated like an object instead of a sentient being. It is vital that a person educate him/herself outside of the doctor's office.
1	I generally trust skilled professionals across the board. I assume someone who was intelligent and hardworking enough to fulfill the obligations of becoming a practicing physician would uphold the integrity of the position.
-1	"I trust my primary care physician for the following reasons: She is always attentive and shows interest in my line of questioning when it comes to description of symptoms, inquiries with regards to preventative maintenance (i.e. discussing future concerns based on age, family history as it relates to my current health, etc.). I never feel rushed during a routine visit when it comes to discussing concerns and overall health strategies. Overall, I feel that she cares about my well-being. My main distrust point with my primary care physician is the ""physical"" side of routine examinations. I feel like she is less comprehensive during the exam than my prior physician with regards to tests and covering all aspects of the exam. This is an additional concern now that I am older and more susceptible to common problems (e.g. enlarged prostate, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)."
-1	I think most doctors do what they think is right and its not always up to date. I live in a rural community so they don't always stay current.
1	He is thorough and talks to me at length about my conditions.  He is focused on my health.  He works me in whenever I need to talk to him and we can have an appointment that is long if I feel I need it.  And he has done great things for my health and is very intelligent.
-1	I feel that my doctor knows  enough to trsut him but sometimes its okay to get a second opionon to be srure
-1	My physician is not perfect, but nobody is. Despite this limitation, I can trust him to competently assess my situation and recommend appropriate actions. My doctor respects my intellect and will discuss the medical situation with me so that I understand and buy into treatment options. Although he is trained in standard care protocols, which are short-sighted remedy-based approaches, I can evaluate the alternative options myself and competently discuss them with my physician. 
-1	I mostly trust my doctors because they know way more about the medical field than me.  However, doctors can definitely be wrong, which is why I didn't rate the statements above as 5.  Also, there can be some doctors that don't always want what is best for their patient, especially if it would cause too much of an inconvenience to themselves.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to him for several years. He has proven over time that he wants to keep me healthy. He has never diagnosed me incorrectly so I have no reason to believe he is lazy or incompetent. 
-1	I trust my doctor because that is their job to know what is going on. I have not had an interaction yet with a doctor where I feel they were not doing their part to help me understand something. I sometimes think some doctors care more about things they need to be doing than the patient themselves but maybe these particular doctors are more on the research side of things as opposed to patient facing.
-1	I often feel like my doctor is so busy that I am just another body walking through a room to hurry on their way. I often feel like my problems aren't big enough or interesting enough to warrant being given full attention.
-1	I've had the same doctor for approximately 10 years, he's always helpful and knowledgeable. Provides me with answers and comforts my concerns but every visit feels more and more rushed like they are squeezing in more patients than time. It's like you are leading the visit by talking non-stop so he doesn't run away to the next.
1	I answered in regard to my doctor of 30+ years who recently retired. I absolutely trusted him with my children, whom he delivered, and myself. He always turned out to be right, always listened and explained things, gave me options. I have not seen a different doctor yet because I lost my job and do not have any health insurance.
-1	I don't feel as though my doctor knows me or cares that much about my well being in particular. I think he sees me just as any other patient. I think that can become dangerous because then the doctor applies a one size fits all type mentality. 
1	I have had my primary care dr for many years. I know he is a very good man who does his best to help me. He knows a lot about different things. He knows my history. He spends the time to listen to me. I still make my own decisions about things, but I really do trust him a lot. 
1	I completely trust my doctor as I have known her for a long time, and she is also a friend of the family. She is highly regarded by her peers and the medical community in general. She is very professional, honest, and kind.
1	My doctor always makes sure to involve me in the decisions of my care. He always makes sure to ask if I have any questions. He spends an appropriate amount of time discussing my health with me and the reasons he is making the decisions he is. He always provides information about medications possible side effects.
-1	I feel that they usually know what they are doing but you can't expect them to care deeply about you because they see so many people that can't care about each one a great deal. Doctors work long hours and make mistakes because they are human so you need to watch what they do and say carefully to as a mistake they make can cause a good deal of harm to you or possibly death. Doctors are also going to lie from time to time as again they are human., in my experience doctors also have an over inflated ego which can cause problems as they are less likely to second guess their decisions.
-1	While I believe doctors are a trustworthy lot, in general, I am also aware that doctors see many patients per day and treatment options are constantly changing. Doctors may not be fully aware of the latest developments in medicine. Recently published studies showing adverse reactions to conventional treatments may not be foremost in a doctors mind while treating her patients.
1	My primary physician is a friend who I have known since he was in medical school. He researches constantly and was top of his class for good reason. He knows my health history and respects my personal wants regarding medical care. He also takes time to listen to patients, not just myself, and is always willing to do extra work if need be. 
-1	I believe most doctors can be trusted in giving you the best advise available to you. The problem with doctors in the US, is they do not have enough time to spend with patients. They are usually in a rush to get you out of the office, so they can see the next patient. 
-1	i currently have a great pa but often see neurologists and i know i need aggressive doctors and for the most part have been satisfied. i am an odd example of ms and have needed unusual treatment. 
1	My doctor has been in business for over 40 so years. And he is due for retirement soon. He is extremely empathetic to my concerns and very friendly when I first met  him. I think his attitude and experience have given me a great gift.
1	I have a regular physician at the university hospital. I have been seeing him for past few years. So far, I do not have any issues with. During my visit, he is always very professional. He seems to care a lot about patients. He is always polite, kind and caring. He seems very focused during the diagnosis. After careful examination, he has been able to explain my problems in simple words and recommend the proper treatment. He always warns about possible side effects of any prescription.  So, far I have not had any issues with treatment and medicines. That is why I trust my physician very much. 
-1	I trust my PCP because they are good at explaining situations with my health and laying out options. I am skeptical whether ALL possibilities are considered, but I am confident that the most likely scenarios are addressed first. 
1	I trust my physician because my friend and my friends mom were her patients. They went to a school i am familiar with . They have always explain everything and provided care for me. 
1	My doctor listens to my concerns without trying to push certain medications or treatment when do not benefit me in the long run.
1	I trust my doctor but I realize that sometimes a problem needs a different viewpoint. I think that my doctor does the best she can but sometimes a problem needs an expert in a different field. I trust my doctor to admit this and move me on to see that person. I think that my doctor has my best interest in mind when she makes decisions related to my health. 
-1	I do not really fully trust any doctor that much since sometimes whatever is affecting me cannot be solved by my doctors. 
-1	I currently don't have a PCP and haven't even gone to a doctor in over 3 years. I do have problems with depression and anxiety and was being seen at a mental health clinic up until about 6 months ago when they refused to re-new my medications because I was unable to pay the copays that I owed them.
1	I have been with the same doctor through every health issue and this doctor has always listened and understood everything along the way. I could talk to him about anything.
1	She is always there for me. She lets me know important information about my health. She answers all my questions with patience.
-1	I believe that she is kind and caring and will use her best judgement in my treatment. Obvious she does not know everything about me but she tries to get to know me as best she can. 
-1	I think doctors are packing too many patients into a day. It leaves them without the time or inclination to look too deeply into patients' medical issues. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because I know my physician for more than a decade and he has demonstrated competency and a caring about my medical needs.  
1	I think sometimes Physicians are in a hurry. So it is to their advantage to gloss over your case. So instead of carefully considering your case they just take care of the obvious and move on to the next patient.
-1	I think doctors are overworked and even though they might know the best thing to do, they might not have time to really consider what is best for you. They also cannot possibly keep up with all of the things they need to when it comes to research or making sure the best things for the patients arent changing.
1	I trust my primary care physician because everything he has told me has improved my quality of life. I have yet to experience anything bad and his knowledge is evident at first glance.
1	My doctor has never steered me wrong before when I've come in with any issues, and he has always seemed very genuine, understanding, and honest. He always makes sure I understand everything and makes sure I know I can always follow up with him about anything if ever necessary. 
-1	I have self diagnosed before I go to the dr. and had to push for the dr to ask for a test . That was contrary to his diagnosis. He then did the test and I was  correct. It was very frustrating !
-1	I do not trust many doctors in general which is why I don't go to the doctor very often. I believe that many doctors are just sellers of drugs and make way too much money in royalties for talking people in to taking certain drugs.
1	My doctor is open, funny, and easy to approach.  I enjoy my doctor and don't feel nervous asking my doctor questions pertaining to my health.
1	He listens to what I say and asks questions to clarify. He remembers from visit to visit small details about my health issues. He does additional research when needed.
1	I have known him a long time, He also helped look after my parents and he was always honest with me. Most of the time I think to honest, But that was ok I needed something to be put bluntly  for me to digest everything that was happenings. My Dr understood that, he took the time to understand that being blunt was what I needed.
-1	My doctor has gone to great lengths to help me. I am always confident that they know what they are doing or are at least trying to help. This is why I keep going to them.
-1	It is natural for people to try and get as much money as possible. This applies to doctors because certain procedures that might be unnecessary are sometimes ordered so that the doctor can bill you or your insurance more than he typically could. I have good insurance so I do not mind having extra tests performed because it is not costing me anything and i am getting thorough examinations 
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician.  Sometimes, there are things he does that's unclear at first but he's usual thorough in terms of explaining things. 
-1	Trust my primary care doctor because they have my best intentions at heart and they are highly esteemed in their profession. They get good results and give thorough advice and council.
-1	I feel like my doctor is quick to recommend pharmaceutical drugs for everything I have and go through. I don't like this approach, I like to do things naturally so when he suggests things, I lose a little trust. I also feel like this is generally all doctors. I think they get kickbacks for the medications they prescribe, so it makes me much less trusting of their motives.
1	Overall, I trust in my doctor because of her confidence and demeanor. She has always been extremely kind, full of information, and has let me know of alternatives if there are any. A primary example was when she prescribed me anti depression medication last year. They worked well, and she made me feel confident that they would help with my situation. 
1	My doctor has seen me for several years. I trust them a lot because of the rapport we have built. My doctor has always given me great advice about my health, and has inquired about my life and goals. I think my doctor always tries his best with me. 
1	I have had good reviews from other patients who are my friends, and longtime patients of my doctor. He has never made me felt rushed and answered all my questions to my satisfaction.
-1	My last Primary care physician was a confident man that could answer my questions and was very receptive to any suggestions or bringing up other forms of care. 
-1	I trust my doctors in general because they have much more experience than I do and would imagine that would lead them to make or suggest the right options for me in regards to my health.
1	I've had my primary care physician for a very long time and they always give me good recommendations based off of the life that they know I want to live. For example, I'm not really into taking medications if I can help it so if something can be aided naturally by eating healthier or exercising more, they nudge me in that path. Obviously if I have a severe cold or infection, I take their prescription that they recommend but they are aware that if I have to work a little harder to set a goal to get back on track, I'll take that path. And I really appreciate that from them!
-1	I have always had good interaction with my primary care physician and feel like i can trust them with all of medical needs.  This person does not judge me and gives advice for all things that i come to them with.  I have never had a reason not to trust this person. 
-1	I do not believe that he spends enough time with me to really get to know me. He has given me drugs which help a little, but never asked me in depth about my chronic pain or fatigue, nor has he referred me to a specialist who could.
1	I've had my doctor for 10 years now.  He was my fathers doctor for over 20 years and he also treats my sister.  He's kind, very smart and has a lot of experience.  He's always willing work me into his schedule even if it means skipping his lunch or staying late.  So yeah, I trust him completely.
-1	I like that my primary care physician usually presents me with multiple courses of action to take for different problems (i.e. different medications).  However, it comes across as being a little indecisive sometimes when I'd rather have a straight yes or no kind of answer.  He also is quick to recommend a specialist instead of giving a medical opinion himself. Overall I think he is trustworthy, though maybe overly cautious.
1	I trust my primary care physician. Because he went to school to gain knowledge to help people and I truly believe he trys to do what he thinks is the best to help me and learn what will be the best to help other people as well sometimes doctors have to try different approaches to get the best outcome that will help each individual overall. 
-1	My doctor is very sweet and kind to me, I don't see why she would purposefully be dishonest with me about anything. Sometime's I'm confused by what she tells me, but that isn't her fault.
1	My physicians assistant is very kind, listens, engaging, good sense of humor and makes me feel comfortable. He does not make me feel bad about myself if i am unsure or if i feel the need to vent or unload about a situation that is tied to feeling unwell to my situation. I would be very upset if he changes practices. 
1	I trust my physician because she has always been honest with me and straight forward. She always tells me things even if it isn't exactly what I want to hear 
1	My doctor is a very good doctor, who i trust completely. I have been seeing her for the past 4 year. I feel that she always tells me the truth and looks out for my bet interest. Anytime that i feel something is wrong she always listens to me and doesnt blow me off. There has been times when she has made appointments for me for follow ups, within like a week. I have not had others doctors do that
-1	I trust my doctor because I've been seeing them for almost 10 years and they're familiar with my health and what works best for my body.  Up to this point, they've always given me accurate information and helped me improve my health in a safe way.
-1	My doctor has become my friend over the years, not a close friend but a friend of a sort. I can trust him to be concerned when I'm not doing well and to think carefully about what the best course of action would be for me. I feel confident about his decision making.
1	My doctor is a DO, so I already feel that the philosophical underpinnings of his education are more patient focused than illness focused. He listens carefully to what I tell him, and responds point by point to my statements. He trusts in my personal medical judgement as far as my chronic conditions.
-1	I go to my university health center currently, where I feel the credentials to be a medical professional are slightly more lax compared to a pediatrician you may go to as an adolescent or child. In my opinion the structured, budget friendly operation of a university health center is caked with many professionals screening and treating students the same for the most part. While I can rely on them for blood work, sexually transmitted disease screening, general prescriptions, and counseling services I would not go to them for diagnosis or anything major. I personally would prefer a resident at a hospital to the nurses I usually see. At some colleges it is worse than mine, some only have nurses and no licensed doctors. As such I don't really trust my doctor, but it's not awful.
1	I completely trust my doctor. She takes a lot of time to listen to my concerns and answer any questions I may have. She never makes me feel rushed like a lot of other doctors. She works on a gameplan to treat something with what I am most comfortable with. Most importantly, she was able to quickly diagnose a foot pain I had been experiencing for months which gave me a lot of confidence in her abilities.
-1	I don't have a doctor, or see one regularly, I only go when I have a problem. So I'm just not going to trust some random doctor I've never met before, especially when my money is on the line.
-1	I believe that my primary care physician has outdated information on certain things. It's not like they go back to school every couple of months to get updated information on certain conditions. I also believe that they kept bonuses for pushing pills on to people.
-1	The last time I went to the doctor they ran a lot of tests on me that resulted in a $700 bill, later when I saw my gyno he said that the tests were unnecessary. I don't have a need to go to the doctor right now but I would look for another place to go. 
1	My primary care physician was extremely amiable. Even if we were not dealing with something that was quite within the realm of his expertise (such as my anxiety) he would recommend literature I could read on the subject.  He would never fail to ask follow-up questions about things I'd experienced in a previous appointment with him. 
1	I trust my doctor because he has decades of experience in conventional medicine, and also has obtained extra courses lately in naturopathy. He is very knowledgable about medical conditions and how to treat them both conventionally or alternatively with herbs, homeopathy etc. He always looks me in the eye and listens. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with her for a long time. She remembers my name and is always very polite and seems generally concerned for me when I show up. Any questions that I asked are answered whole-heartedly and it feels she cares about me instead of just trying to get a bunch of my money through unneeded things.
1	I trust my OBGYN, I just think he is a little c-section happy.  Two high risk pregnancies and two c-sections for someone who wanted a natural birth is a little disappointing, but everyone is healthy and alive so can't complain with the results.
-1	I try to avoid going to my doctor unless it's absolutely necessary.  I don't trust them because I have anxiety and depression and it makes trust almost impossible for me.  I realize that this is all on me but I just find it not possible for me.  I would like very much to do it.  I know they're not going to lie to me but I still find that I just don't trust any of them.
1	They are always very thorough in explaining what the possibilities are for treatment. They are always so careful in explaining the pros and cons of each treatment in a way that I can weigh them more easily.
-1	I have trust in my physician because he has always been correct regarding any health issue I have had in the past. I have no reason to distrust him as I have never left an appointment feeling anything has been overlooked when it comes to my health
-1	She takes time to really listen to me. If I am doubting something, or questioning why about things she will explain it. I don't feel like I cannot bring things up to her. For example when I mentioned my anxiety she really took time to get me on meds that made me feel better. It made all the difference in the world to me. 
1	She takes the time to listen to me and is very thorough in her explanations. Asks about my feelings etc.
1	My doctor has always been kind to me. She answers all my questions and listens to my concerns. She gives me different options and helps me decide which is best for me.
1	I see my PCP every 60 to 90 days for migraines. He will listen to my every need or issue. Often I may have something else nagging me (back pain, neck pain) and no matter what he will address these issues and guide me in the right direction. 
-1	"I see my PCP once a month and in any given 12 month period he may take my BP or listen to my heart 1 or 2 times in those 12 months.  He does not generally ask how I am doing or feeling only comes in, sits down in front of the computer and asks ""what do you need today"" referring to Rx refills.  He is not a hands on doctor and If I should ask or complain about a problem he dismisses it and says we are all getting older."
1	I trust my primary care physician fully because he is a very good doctor. I have been seeing him since I was a child and he has always given me the best care and been right about his diagnosis on the first try. He is nice and good at communication and making sure I fully understand everything and am comfortable
1	I have had the same doctor for 30 years and he is like an extended family member, I feel he cares for me and will always suggest what he feels is the best treatment for me, he is very professional with an excellent bedside manner.
-1	I have been going to the same Doctor since I was a child, they care but they also don't make any money off me if I'm dead
-1	I am a very critical person. So I am always looking for more information than what is given. It has nothing to do with my doctor being a bad doctor, and more with my inquisitive disposition. 
-1	I like my doctor, but his clinic is so busy that I sometimes get the feeling that he goes with the easiest explanation of something. It makes me willing to spend a bit more money to go to a clinic that I know isn't busy if needed.
-1	I don't care for my doctor much. I hadn't been to a doctor in 10 years. Before that I had a bad experience with my doctor. Recently I've also had a bad experience. Just more medical bills for them to prescribe me crap. Basically a 100 version of a drug that I could get for $1 over the counter,.
-1	"I don't have a primary care physician. I don't go to doctors much and have had mixed results. Different doctors have told me that strep is nothing to worry about and others have been ""upset"" that I didn't come in sooner. "
1	My primary care physician has demonstrated competency in his profession to me. That is the primary reason I have for trusting him. The medical problems I've had over the years have been solvable, and my primary care physician has always assisted me in that regard. He also trusts my judgement on my own health issues and will issue necessary prescriptions by phone if he's convinced that I need them.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he has a lot of experience in the medical field.  He serves as a mentor and teacher in the medical community and seems to be an expert in his field.  
1	I trust my primary care physician.  When I went to him and told him I was depressed he immediately referred me to a social worker/therapist.  He did not just prescribe me medicine on his own.  He is careful and conservative but effective.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is very polite, respectful, and reputable. He is more than willing to assist me in my health needs as well as my decisions regarding choices that are more optional than necessary such as vitamin capsule intake. Overall, he's very helpful and a great source of health knowledge. 
-1	My doctor is very open when discussing medical issues and concerns with me.  There is no issue discussing alternatives, side effects, etc.  The doctor never makes me feel uncomfortable and has always provided me with accurate information.
-1	Because I have a lot of experience in care physicians giving me the wrong treatment, tests, and medications.  I have suffered a lot of negative side effects because of doctors not believing me. Doctors in my are do not have the knowledge to help me how I need to be helped. They are not willing to individualize their treatments according to individuality and differences. This made me skeptical over a lot of doctors.
-1	"I have only seen my primary care doctor a couple of times, but she is someone my family regards highly and who has been very good to them. As a result of their good experiences, I am generally inclined to think positively of my doctor and trust her judgement. I do, however, feel I need more time to develop any feeling akin to ""complete trust."""
1	I do not really have much distrust in the my primary care physician. I feel like he does a great job in being honest and transparent.
-1	I have never known him to lie about anything but sometimes I don't think another drug is the answer for everything, I like natural approaches to as many things as possible.
1	I've had my doctor for a long time. She always listens when i want to talk and has given me excellent advice in the past.
1	I have been working with my primary care doctor for several years. She has a personal connection to another organization that I work with, and a similar background to my own. She has gone out of her way to build trust and extend sincere personal insight.
1	My doctor is completely honest with me whenever I had an appointment. He tells me exactly what is wrong and the possibles outcomes of it, as well as the aproaches I can take.
-1	My PCP just seems to have a diagnosis ready to go before we even speak. He rarely seems to be concerned with side effects I report and love to have tests run. His focus just seems very narrow, he is late and just dismissive. 
-1	My doctor is usually backed up and busy and I usually feel rushed and that he is just trying to get to the next patient
1	I only see my gynecologist regularly and I trust his opinion on conditions I am dealing with. He explains it to me clearly so I can understand what is going on and he makes me feel comfortable. He gets to know me as a person aside from just a patient and makes me feel like he cares about my overall well being. 
-1	He's very down to earth and tells me what is protocol but also what is necessary. He's a big proponent of preventative care and has always backed up his suggestions with research.
-1	I trust Doctors because they are in their position for a reason, but just like any other Profession they don't get to make the rules, are worried about getting sued, or don't trust their patients to tell them the truth and often go with their own assumptions, which can be both good and bad.
-1	I don't completely trust any doctor. I feel like sometimes they are just guessing what a problem or solution is. I take the information the doctor gives and make my own choices on what I believe and what my next steps will be. 
-1	I distrust doctors a bit in general because I've had bad experiences in the past with doctors leading me down the wrong path. At the end of the day they are still just human and I believe it should be a team process in finding the best treatment for you since you are the one that has to live with the consequences. 
1	She was recommended to me by a friend i trust. She listens to my concerns and addresses them. She is warm, sympathetic, and seems very intelligent and competent.
-1	If I have taken the steps to be in the presence of a healthcare professional, I have exhausted my own body of knowledge and MUST trust them to investigate further and explain the options for treatment as they may be. Their schooling and Hippocratic oath make them the only option at that point, hence one has no option but to trust someone, why not a trained and certified medical professional. 
-1	We tend to put doctors on a pedestal and to me this is so absurd.  They are human and subject to human error.  There is so much medical negligence.  You read about it just about every day.  My doctor does not hesitation to write out a prescription.  He is aware that I am totally against taking prescribed drugs. He only cares about a quick fix.   I also feel that it's a money game.  
-1	i trust my doctot because he always goes to great lengths to get to the bottom of my health issues and ive known my doctor since i was young an ive never had any issues with him all the time ive went to him
-1	Honestly I think its more about money than care of the patient. There is never a sense of urgency with doctors. 
1	I feel doctors, in general, have the patient's care and well-being in mind when they are treating them. I feel that a patient has to have that trust in their doctor or they should probably get a new one.  A patient needs to feel that trust because their doctor is such an important part of staying well, or getting well.
-1	They have given me wrong diagnosis before- leading to wrong medication and side effects and addition to the HUGE bills!!!
-1	I have Type 2 diabetes and I know that my condition is not as serious as everybody else since every time I'm eating a healthy diet, my numbers stay stable and I would feel great. My doctor keeps trying to push insulin to me even though, I know I don't need it. She even mentioned that they are normally told by their providers to try to offer insulin more towards patients. They try to restrict my refills for a diabetic medicine that I normally need just so that they could make me come in and so that they can charge my insurance company. They won't give me refills until I check-in with them, which for something standard like Diabetes, I don't think I need.
-1	I trust my physician for the most part. There are times though that I have questioned her. It is because medical degree or not we all have preferences and she is going to only offer me her preferences and I may not know about other options 
1	For the most part I trust my doctor. They have always been honest with me and see to take the time to explain the problems that I have. There have been times where I asked a million questions and they are more than happy to answer. My daughters doctor is a little different. They always seem to be in a rush. 
1	"My primary care physician is a very thoughtful doctor.  He listens closely to what I have to say, and thinks about his responses.  He has a lot of experience, and he seems to have a ""conservative"" approach, in that he doesn't immediately jump to an aggressive treatment."
1	I have been going to the same doctor for 14 years and have only had good experiences.  She listens and does not always push medications.
-1	i do trust my primary care doctor as he has been my personal physician for over year now. He always thinks good about us and give us good medication . 
-1	I think that nowadays, most doctors are about the money that they want to make and they will give you the treatment that cost the most even if a cheaper alternative is available.
1	My primary care physician is also my mother's primary care physician and has been since I was 7. He became mine when I was 18 and before that point would ask my mother about how I was doing. He is also a rheumatologist and I have rheumatoid arthritis and have since I was 11. He remembers extremely minor details and things about me and my health without having to look through my file every time I visit. He is extremely busy but always takes time to follow up and is very thorough. He is willing to recommend I take a treatment that he cannot provide and is genuinely interested in keeping me in the best health possible.
1	I have seen my current doctor for several years now. he has always listened to my concerns and has worked with me in finding the best treatment that iI need.
1	I mean, it is their job to make sure that I receive the best care possible. I am sure they don't want to be facing some sort of repercussions based on how they care for me. I would like to think that they became doctors to help people like me to get the best care they can administer, and so it would be somewhat out of character if they were to skimp on my care.
-1	I trust my doctor but if I had a serious illness I would see a specialist and if I was given a new medication I would investigate it before taking it.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but overall I think doctors will do what they can to help you. Unfortunately I think sometimes circumstances force them to treat patients in more of a hurry which may make them seem like they don't care. But overall I think most doctors genuinely want to help people and have no interest other than to help you get well.
1	Doctors take an oath of not doing harm and with the risk of malpractice they would not do what is convenient but what is right.
-1	I have not really found a good primary care physician yet. I had a good one, but he retired. The new one I have found so far has not impressed me. He is ok, but I don't feel as comfortable talking to him and sometimes feel like he jumps to conclusions about me or my condition without fully evaluating the information I have provided.
-1	I think that doctors have lots of time constraints so they tend to limit the appropriate amount of time necessary for their patients 
-1	I feel that the majority of doctors have taken a general approach to caring for patients. I think they are forced to see so many patients an hour that if you complain about a typical set of things then they prescribe or recommend x based solely off that.
-1	Alot of my anxiety of fully trusting doctors boils down to when my grandfather was sick.  The doctors were not able to identify the source of his fever until I mentioned that after googling his symptoms that lymphoma has all the same symptoms.  Only then, they finally tested and were able to diagnose him 24 hours before he passed away.
-1	I trust my doctor to the extent that he does not want me to die.  But I am not 100% confident that he has presented me with all the available remedies for my situation as there are new drugs and theories being discovered yearly.
1	My doctor seems professional; I have no reason to distrust their advice given to me with regards to my health. Every step they've taken when I've been unwell has made a lot of sense and ultimately helped me.
-1	It is not that I trust or distrust my primary care physician. Instead, it is simply wanting to question things in order to protect myself regardless. This method works for my best interest.
1	I trust my doctor because he has yet to steer me wrong. Whenever I am having a problem or I need a question answered he is there to listen and give me a thorough diagnosis. He also looks out for me by recommending me the best products with the lowest price. If my problem can be fixed easily with a drugstore product then my doctor has no problem bringing up that product first. Even if I feel as though my problem was major and my doctor diagnoses it as something simple like a stomach ache, he will still treat the situation as important and reassures me in showing that it wasn't a waste of time to come.
-1	There have been many times over the past several years that I've gone to doctors with medical complaints, probably all coming from the same source, and left their care with no real effective plan of treatment, and limited insight about what precisely is going wrong with my health, and this applies to primary care physicians, and specialists, and ER doctors. It seems pretty clear that either they can't treat whatever is wrong with me, or just don't care.
-1	I did quite a bit of research before I finally selected my doctor.  She has very good reviews from other parents, and works for a very reputable institution, Johns Hopkins.  Most of my interactions with her have been extremely positive and she has given me no reason not to trust her judgment.  My one concern is that she seems to be extremely busy, and probably feels pressure not to spend much more than 15 minutes with any of her patients.
-1	My PCP means well (and I do not at all mean that as a sarcastic comment) but like most PCPs in the days of managed care plans, he is overworked and cannot take the time to really get to know each patient thus some critical things can fall through the cracks unless I make a point of bringing them up to him.  Otherwise, he just orders blood work every three months and bases his whole appointment with me on the bloodwork results instead of, for example, looking at the fact that as a 60 year old woman with severe osteoporosis (due to my osteogenesis imperfecta) I am supposed to be having annual bone density scans.   I have to bring up things like bone density scans, mammograms, etc. to him myself because if it is not a blood test result, it will fall through the cracks.   In his defense, I will say, he orders thorough blood tests, goes over the results with me to make sure I understand them and when I do bring up something outside of the blood tests, he listens and works with me on it.  He is a good doctor, just overworked.  I don't trust him to be aware of my health conditions.  I do trust him to work with me when I remind him of what is going on with me.
1	I have never had any reason not to trust her. All care I have received has been prompt and efficient and addressed any concerns/issues I had.
-1	I would have faith and hope that as a trained physician they are both skilled and have the knowledge and upkeep in the medical field. They do this as a living, doctors/nurses and physicians, so I should put at least some trust into their job that they are evaluating me and my health properly.
1	My primary care physician has the qualifications and the experience to make the right decisions. She also takes into consideration my opinion and strives to give me the highest quality of life she can.
-1	I have no reason to not trust him. I don't believe that he would knowingly do anything to harm me and he has no reason to lie to me. Also I've grown to trust him after seeing him for some time. 
-1	I trust my primary physician because they would have no reason to lie to me or falsify any information. They would not benefit at all from lying to me so it would not be worth doing that at all. 
1	My physician does a great job of explaining things carefully and thoughtfully. He also believes in getting a second opinion when needed.
1	I trust the care of my primary care physician because I have been a patient with him for years and also because I am a LPN, he trusts my knowledge as well and we can always come to a decision together regarding my care.
-1	I trust my doctor. He has been caring for me and my family for years and we have been in good health. he has always provided the correct recommendations and we have trust in him
-1	Most doctors are greedy. The money is more important than our health. They perform unnecessary treatments to earn more money
-1	I trust my doctors because they answer my questions when I ask them, they don't treat me like a child or an idiot, and they actually pay attention to what I am saying. My doctors are engaged with me as a person and while our goal is to make me feel better, it never feels like the docs are focused on the endgoal - diagonsis - and are instead focused on me and what I need and what I'm feeling. 
1	If a doctor has great bedside manner it makes it easy to trust them. Most of the doctors I have ever been to have had a great bedside manner which makes it feel like they are there for me and not just to do what is convenient for him/her. A doctor that is rude makes it hard to believe
1	My doctor always gives me several options for and would be treatment I may need be it medicine, further testing and even sending me for second opinions.
-1	Because if they are so rushed to see you and need to make appointments that they can't even keep most of the time, then something is wrong with their time management. I feel like I've told the doctor things before and they just brush it off like it's no big deal or that it's normal when I know that it's not. They just don't want to have to sit there any longer. 
-1	i respect them because they help me alot concerning my health.they  do tell me reality whenever i visit them and they give me advices about coping with life experiences. through them,i have a sense of belonging even when i tend to feel that my life is meaningless
1	I was going to the same primary care physician since i was very young. My mother personally knows my doctor so i feel very comfortable taking advice from that person. I think this person has good intentions and really wants to help me 
-1	In my case I have always looked for doctors who earn my trust. Currently my doctor is trusted because he has a lot of academic experience and also has a very good experience practicing what he already knows. During the consultations shows that he knows what he is doing, and that gives me confidence, something that is very important to deposit in a doctor
1	I had trouble for a long time finding a good doctor. I had stomach issues and other weird problems for a decade. Then I switched to my current doctor, she tested my thyroid and Iâve felt so much better since. Sheâs been pretty spot on since Iâve started seeing her. My whole family see her we trust her so much. 
-1	My primary care physician sometimes did not respond to my request about different treatment options. She swayed me into a specific option without asking my opinion. My friends got a certain treatment option but she did not even let me ask for that,
-1	I trust my doctor because he is a smart, competent person who is not in a rush and cares about providing my good advice and counsel.  But I also realize that there are limits to his experience and knowledge and he rarely runs tests to understand the problems.  So yes, I trust that he isn't lying but I don't always believe that he is correct.
1	I mostly trust my doctor. He seems like a nice and caring guy and very thorough. I haven't been seeing him long, but I think he does a good job and is very attentive. 
1	My primary doctor is easy to communicate with, she provides easy to understand responses and is thorough.  She is part of a larger medical system that provides excellent care.  She works well with other doctors/staff from the larger system.  I can count on her.
-1	I lost a lot of trust in the medical field in general and especially with doctors while uncovering some information over the years. When I have learned that companies pay doctors to push their pharmaceuticals and also offer them incentive for prescribing their products and meeting up with them. Uncovering things like this just added to the distrust in the medical profession. 
1	I went to several Doctors to find the one that I have now.  My doctor will stay in the room with you until they have answered all questions.  My doctor does not let anything else distract him while you are being examined.  The doctor will ask several times if you understand or if you need them to go over anything else again.
1	She is thorough and she actually listens to me. She wants what is best for me, but doesnt put me through unnecessary testing.  She is kind and follows up. She is quick to answer questions when I ask
1	My doctor was really good, he seemed to care a lot for his patients. Sometimes you could tell, because he would go out of his way to do things that seemed above and beyond. He was also older so you knew he was putting forth more effort than someone who was younger.
1	doctor seems competent, will answer any questions i have and usually explain things before i need them to be explained. very detailed and always up to date on task
1	I trust what my doctor says about a medical condition. I have found that what I read about a given condition was in agreement with what the doctor said about the condition. I trust what my doctor says about a specialist to see. For example, if my doctor recommends a specialist doctor, I know it will be someone who is excellent. I have checked the patient reviews for a recommended specialist and found out that the reviews were consistent with what my doctor had said about the specialist.
-1	I do not either trust or distrust my doctor. I feel they are they to evaluate my physical condition and to make recommendations to maintain or improve my health. They are a valuable resource which I can then use to make a decision of how to proceed given the options which have been discussed.
-1	I do not trust doctors in general. I believe that it all about the money so to speak. Medicine has caused more issues than the ailments it is said to assist with. If one medicine helps with one ailment for example, then it more than likely has at least ten side effects. Not to mention the costs of medicine. If someone is healthy, they make no money. 
-1	I have had a lot of changes with my primary care physician so I cannot always trust that the doctor I saw the last time will be the same doctor I see the next time, but the doctor that I have currently been seeing I have much trust in. 
1	They have many years of experience and tell me their thoughts and diagnoses without trying to put anything delicately or hiding any concerns.
-1	I have not been to a doctor in over 15 years, so I do not fully trust doctors, but that's not why I haven't been, I just know that unless its something very strange or a broken bone, most things go away with just taking care of yourself, good nutrition and staying hydrated works for me. I havent even used over the counter medicine at all in over 10 years. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. Since seeing my current doctor, he has on one occasion spent almost an hour with me explaining why my cholesterol is the way it is. The fact that he invested that much time with me instead of leaving in 10-15 minutes told me that he cares about what I need to know and is willing to take the time to make sure I understand why things happen like they do.
1	I trust my Dr because he takes his time while I am there for my visit.  He leaves no stone unturned.  He always does blood work before the visits.  He orders appropriate test just in case.  He encourages me to continue on a healthy path.  He helps in dieting and what to eat and what not to eat.  I also trust my Dr because he is sought after by lots of patients.  He is always booked up.  He has been in the business for quite a few years.  
-1	She never remembers me.  I go in for one problem and she ignores it and instead complains about my weight.  I once went to her to acquire a sedative for a very stressful upcoming doctor appointment and she screamed at me saying if I take 4 Valium pills I will turn into an addict.  She also gets my age wrong every time.  I only go to her for referrals.  She is at an age where I think she needs to retire and every time I have been there I never see any patients in the waiting room.  Her online reviews are also terrible. 
1	My doctor takes a great deal of time with his patients.  My last wellness visit lasted 1 1/2 hours.  I met with his assistant, his student doctor and him.  They took a full medical and social history.  Because he is a teaching doctor and has a 3rd year medical student working with him, he uses the questions I ask as an opportunity to educate both me and his student.  He runs all the tests he feels are needed to make sure I am in good physical shape.  He also counsels me on nutrition. 
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician because he acts very rushed. He only wants to deal with one issue per appointment. I am also worried that doctors are encouraged to prescribe pharmaceuticals over other treatment options.
1	I do trust doctors for the most part, they have the education and experiences above my own. I think that the trust I put in my doctors, as well as the research I can do on my own, makes a good team in my healthcare.
-1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has extensive experience in her field. She is backed by a degree specializing in her area and she's had no complaints from me or any other patients. She makes me feel comfortable.
-1	I've been seeing my current PCP for 9 years but he often forgets (even with my records in front of him) the nature of my chronic conditions. He is disorganized, abrupt, and has a tendency to dismiss my concerns
1	My primary care physician was my pediatrician. I reconnected with him after 20 years. He is a good listener, and not fond of medications. Likes me to work out problems every other way before trying meds.
-1	I do understand that some doctors try to generalize symptoms for pharmaceutical practices here in America. This sometimes causes doctors to prescribe certain drugs or procedures that may be common to their field. However, I think healthcare has allowed more transfers from physicians to the specialist. Helping things become more focused and thorough.
1	My primary care physician has never given me a reason to distrust him. He is always willing to listen to what is bothering me, give his professional opinion of the cause, and let me choose from the treatment options available. Over time, he has earned my complete trust.
-1	I havent felt that my doctor has ever misled me in the past, nor given me bad advice. Whatever I went into the doctors for, eventually was healed or cured. 
1	I mean he's my primary doctor. If i can't trust him i would go find a new one. It's very important to have a doctor you trust in because if not you won't be able to get the treatment you deserve.
-1	"I don't have a current one, but my last one accused me of drinking a ""starbucks milkshake"" before my blood test when I repeatedly answered that I had not consumed anything that morning for the blood test. He also fought with me about my premie status as a baby and whether or not the scar sites were for a heart surgery I had to fix a murmur. I've seen my own bill for my birth, I had the surgery. He then tried to forcefully sign me up for Jenny Craig before I left, which would not be covered by my insurance, and insisted on offering me the flu shot after I declined several times because I already had the shot. "
1	My primary care doctor is somebody who I have known for quite some time. I trust that he has my best interests at heart and will always make sure that his decisions reflect where I want to be with the treatment. 
1	My physician likes to push different new medications on me instead of worrying about the side effects that I would have in taking these medications. I do get a great deal from my physician in the way of ordering test and sharing about my disease. I wish that my physician cared about my daily issues and not so much about the different medications they want me to try. My doctor comes off as a drug pusher at times. I also feel as if my doctor is always in a rush and that makes me lose my concentration.
-1	I believe that my doctor has my back because that is his job.  He is competent and pragmatical, and he would undoubtedly explore treatment options with me.
1	"I don't have a primary care physician, I pretty much just go to whoever I'm sent to.  To put it simply, I haven't run into any doctors who did NOT give me any reason to trust them.  All of them have been professional.  True, one of them didn't have a good ""bedside manner"", but that was it.  He still got the job done.  "
-1	I have never had a bad experience with a doctor. I always ask questions and have an open dialog. It works for me.
-1	My PCP is not somebody that I see very often. I have not gone to my PCP regularly for about 5 years now. I only go if there is something seriously wrong, which has only been like 2 times in the past 5 years.
-1	I had a doctor for years who was incredibly thorough and I did completely trust always. Unfortunately that doctor is no longer in practice. I have had experiences with other doctors that have led me to question whether they truly are thorough at all, and I don't have the level of trust with any of my current providers that I had with my former PCP. 
1	My primary care physician has been my primary care physician since I was a teenager and she is the provider I take my kids to. When she has been wrong she has admitted it. She fits us in at the last minute when needed, is willing to try more than one thing when I ask and always listens and take into account what I have to say. I worry about finding a new provider when she retires.
1	She shows me that she cares. She refers me to specialists when she's unsure, she follows up with me quickly, and she seems very knowledgeable.
-1	I believe doctors had some participatory stake in the prescription opiate mess.  While most doctors didn't have inside information on the pharmaceutical industry's practices  with respect to testing and marketing, I believe there have been relatively few doctors who have actually expressed a lot of remorse about the whole affair. That being said, doctors can't be held entirely accountable for living in a culture that is, in some sense, addictive in its makeup. My attitude toward doctors is governed by the principle that I do not expect mistake-free behavior on the part of anyone. All I ask is that doctors or other medical professionals who work with me give their best effort and use the best information available to them.
1	I trust my primary care physician completely. He is wise, sensible, practical. He always has time for questions or discussion on issues important to me. He has never steered me wrong.
1	For the most part, I put a great deal of trust in my doctors.  I listen to their diagnosis and try to ask relevant questions until I have a good understanding of the condition and subsequent treatment plan.  I do however try to verify on my own and if I do have more questions, I do not hesitate to get a second opinion from another reputable health care provider.  I have, however, not had a bad experience with the various doctors that I have sought treatment from. 
1	I have seen my primary physician for a number of years. He has always been thorough in hearing out my problems and then giving multiple options as how to treat the problems. All the times ive had to go see him the diagnosis and treatments he has recommended have been spot on
1	I very much trust my primary care physician. She is quite young but doesn't hesitate to scold or call me out when she's not happy with me. I don't like doctors or the whole medical process and she knows what buttons to push. She answers my questions patiently and explains her thought processes behind all her decisions. She very much talks to me and never through me and that's a huge plus. 
-1	Really they are just humans like everyone else. They chose a career path, went to university for many years and got a job in the industry. How much they actually consolidated from their education is questionable. Often times it seems they're doing a lot of common sense work or things that a layman could figure out himself if he had access to the equipment and the internet. You also have to question if they have ulterior motives or reason to push medication that may not be the most advantageous. Their education is very very narrow as well, they don't often know much about natural medicine or even things like paleo diets or aspects/principles of primal living. I have to question what kind of person these doctors are and whether they even value their lives themselves because stepping back it looks like they slaved away at school just to become a doctor and deal with sick people all the time. A life like that would be miserable to me, so I wonder if some doctors even care about anything they are doing or if they are following a path for money or to impress others. 
-1	Sometimes I feel that my primary care physician is stretched too thin and sees too many patients. I realize he cannot remember everything, but he does have my electronic medical record readily available to him. I feel that often I have to repeat issues I have, and I don't think he is just testing my understanding. I think he has forgotten and not bothered to remind himself by reviewing my record. I also have to call the office because I will sometimes get test results before they call me about them. I don't think that my physician would intentionally harm me or lie to me, I just think that he is seeing too many patients - putting quantity over quality to make a profit.
-1	"i haven't been to my primary in years because when i had a medical problem and i came to them they said they wouldn't do test because it wasn't their ""area"". they are general practitioners. everything is their area they could have taken blood and run labs and then refereed me but they didn't do anything  "
1	This specialist has been my doctor for fours.  I have multiple medical issues, all complex.  The doctor has a very high knowledge of the diagnosis and treatments, and gives me all the options.  I trust this doctor very much
-1	It is not that I do not trust my doctor, however, I am aware that my doctor is only trained in western medicine. I am open to remedies and treatments that western medicine may not be knowledgeable about or have believe works. I know that my doctor is limited due to their training. 
-1	For the most part I trust him but there are times when he seems to give me contradictory information from visit to visit and that makes me nervous. For example, one time my cholesterol will be borderline high and he'll mention it as something I need to work on then next time it will be extremely high and he won't say anything.
-1	Very few doctor visits are completely satisfactory, maybe because my expectations are too high. I think that if you see the medical profession as just another job, you tend to just try to go through and get over with any patient care at hand as quickly as you can. 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor for the most part because I develop an relationship with this person for a couple of years now. I know when I need something urgently, they will always be there when I go for help for me and my family.
-1	I do a LOT of research on my own, because I suffer from chronic conditions. When I see a doctor, they don't always mention all of the options available. The docs are double and triple booked in 15 minute time slots, so they don't have a lot of time with each patient. They hardly have the time to fully discuss EVERYTHING that's going on and maybe connect some dots that could be connected. 
-1	Again working in the medical field I see things that worry me and make me more cautious.  Such as, a Dr that delivers too many c sections because he has plans for the weekend and doesn't want to get called in. Or a doctor that doesnt explain appropriately to the patient, or even worse doesn't even see the patient and provides service thru only looking at a chart. 
-1	"I think the vast majority of doctors become insensitive to their patients and their problems.  In fact, I think they lose the ability to even recognize that their patients are people.  They seem to push whatever ""treatments"" benefit themselves the most financially, without any regard to how that's going to affect their patients financially or otherwise.  "
1	although trust has inherent as well as instrumental value for patients, clinicians, and healthcare institutions, trust can be misplaced, and distrust can be unjustified. Thus, if a physician reveals truthfully to a patient how s/he is paid, trust in the physician may diminish as a result of this trustworthy behavior.
-1	I trust that my primary care physician makes good choices and care about me. He is very knowledgeable about his expertise and always very patient to answer my questions. He will analysis different options to me and don't pressure me to make a choice he preferred.
1	The only real reason that I would not trust my PCP is that she is not an expert in a specific medical field. However, I trust her recommendations for specialists implicitly.
-1	"I don't trust my primary care physician because she didn't listen to me when I told her the things which were bothering the most. Instead she arranged expensive tests simply because I'm of an age where I need them and should have them first to rule out things before moving on to the things I am most concerned about. I understand that logic, but when a person is in pain and can pinpoint exactly where that pain is, this information shouldn't be ""put off"" in lieu of routine procedures, no matter if you are due for them or not. "
-1	"In the current times it seems doctors easily push the strongest drugs on a patient. By saying this I don't mean to suggest any link to the opioid crisis in the country. For instance, my last emergency care visit was last year when I had a kidney stone. This wasn't the first time I've ever had one (2nd time in the emergency room for it in 10 years), and they gave me extremely harsh prescriptions. One of the medications prescribed was Ciprofloxacin instead of pencillin to fight bacteria (I apparently had a UTI). After only taking ""Cipro"" a total of 3 times, it gave me deep pain in my joints that lasted for over 6 months. I could hardly walk and I definitely couldn't bend my knees. I think doctors  jump the gun with a lot of medications instead of starting ""small"" to see what works. I tend to believe doctors now are really careless with all the serious side effects because they spend so little time with patients."
-1	I trust a physician to truly want wha tis best, but I do not trust that they will pick the best solution instead of prescirbing the easiest pharmaceutical drug or highest paying one.
1	I have been seeing my primary care doctor for over 15 years. He is very honest and down to earth. I have always taken the advice of my primary care doctor with excellent results. 
-1	Doctors in general seem to want to prescribe the most efficient treatment possible in my opinion. I've only ever had one experience where I felt like the doctor was rushing me along or not really listening to any concerns I had.
1	Overall, I trust my physician.  That isn't to say that I won't seek out more information on a subject after getting my physician's opinion.  I will take what she tells me as a stepping point to learning more for myself.  My physician has shown to be open to Western Culture health care in addition to Eastern Culture health care, and that matters to me.  She is always warm and kind, and strikes me as genuine.
-1	It's their job and usually their calling, so I trust them inasmuch as it makes sense. They're still fallible human beings and I don't mind seeking second opinions. 
1	Out of the plethora of doctors I have seen in my life, only two stand out; one I used to see in another state before we moved and my current doctor.  My current doctor tells it like it is and doesn't sugar-coat anything.  Actually, he is quite assertive with me and I respond well to that.
1	I trust him very much because when I needed help with something he referred me in the right direction. That next experience was a healthy and good experience for me that has made me healthier.
-1	I don't trust my doctor completely. I had a great doctor but he transferred and I got stuck with this guy. I want to change doctors but I am still trying to give this guy a chance because maybe he will get better with time. I know that he tries on his diagnosis but have found that I have had to go to a urgent care more than once because he doesn't get it right.
1	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  He's one of the few good ones left that takes the time to get to know you and talk to you.  I feel like he's a close friend when I'm there.
-1	I haven't been to the doctors in awhile, however, as alluded to in my previous answer, I don't believe dermatology doctor is through. I have had the same issues I presented to him over a year ago and he simple just keeps suggesting new types of medication instead of fixing the root cause.
1	I think my doctor is often busy but is very concerned about my care. He does listen and tries to take time.  He cares more about what is good for me and will schedule more tests and or refer me to another doctor he knows and truest.  Overall he's very good but I always like to check on things myself so I do have to questions what he tells me or get a second opinion and he encourages this.  So far my primary care physician has been very accurate and has offered good advice or treatment.
1	I have been seeing the same primary care physician for 30 years and have established a long-standing and mutually respectful relationship.  While I trust her judgment completely, she also value my input and abides by my wishes if I prefer one plan of action over another.  when I need a referral to a specialist, she acts quickly.
-1	I trust my personal primary care physician because they seem competent and know what they are talking about. I am iffy with doctors because some of them may seem like they are out of touch with society. 
1	Whenever I went to see the doctor he was always completely honest with me. He would tell me what was wrong or if he wasn't completely sure he would work to figure it out and recommend me to another doctor if he couldn't. When i would go in for check ups he would also give me advise on better ways to improve my health. 
-1	I have been seeing my PCP for 10 years and he has always been very good in all ways until two years ago I was sick and nobody could figure out what was wrong. My Dr told me I was just beginning the change of life called perimenopause and had nothing to worry about. I knew that was not right I was much to sick for it to be normal. I went through 5 additional Drs trying to get answers and even specialists. I finally found one Dr who actually sat down and talked to me for an hour which never happens but he could see how sick I was and I had lost so much weight I weighed 81lbs....so he did a whole battery of blood tests and finally after 2 years of being mostly bedridden I had an answer. It was or could have been found in the beginning if my Dr would have listened to me and just did some bloodwork. After that I will go to my regular pcp but I don't trust him after that, he could have killed me. I was diagnosed with pernicious anemia which is a vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Thank God for that one Dr and my gut instincts.
-1	I think that they will try to keep me sick so that they can make money off of me for as long as they can.
-1	I trust my PCP because she tells it like it is. I have met doctors before who cautiously agree with whatever the patient says, because maybe they don't want to alienate or be subject to poor reviews. But my internist is very candid.
-1	Most doctors enter into their profession to help people.  Extensive training is required to become a doctor, so they should know what they are doing.
-1	My physician is currently near the end of her fifth pregnancy and sheâs pretty tired.  I expect things will get better but Iâve been relying more on her nurse practitioner.
-1	My current primary care doctor is only concerned with my weight. In her mind any issue that arises could be solved if I would lose some weight. She always makes sure the address my weight at each visit and ensure that I am aware of the negative ways that being overweight could affect me. She assumes that I will become addicted to certain medications just because I am overweight.
1	I've being going to my doctor for over 35 years.  I trust him explicitly.  He has always been there for me and my family.
-1	I typically trust my primary care physician unless they are inattentive or give me a reason not to trust them. If they lose my trust then I just find a new doctor and I do not give them the chance to betray me a second time. 
-1	I like my primary physician but she often seems rushed. I'm sure she is honest but not always sure she's thinking very much about what I tell her.
-1	I have had several doctors over my lifetime and I don't trust quite a few of them. If they don't listen or believe what I report about my own health then I can't really trust them to make accurate diagnoses or appropriate treatments
-1	I feel that my doctor has often gone out of her way to help since I am in a very dire financial situation. As well she has given me advice and recommendations for alternative treatments for certain problems I have had i.e.she does not believe that drugs are a cure-all but helps me get to the root of certain health conditions.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. I sometimes go off of family/friends opinions of a doctor that I am seeing. In general I'm not sure that I trust doctors completely. I think that sometimes they aren't as thorough as they could be because they are trying to get you out of the office so that they can move on to the next patient.
1	My doctor has given me pretty good advice at my annual physicals without being overly pushy or forward about it. He's personable and laid back and seems to have my best interests at heart.
1	My doctor changes about every year or two, but my most recent doctor has been very honest with me from day 1.
-1	I trust my personal care provider most of the time. She errs on the side of caution. Some doctors at hospital are terrible at listening to complaints and refuse to consider the underlying pain when they hear the word cancer.
-1	I am currently between primary care physicians because my insurance coverage and physical location has changed several times recently. But when I did have a regular primary care physician(s) which I did for many years, I felt that in general I could trust them. However, in all cases I do my own research and use logic whenever possible. I try to avoid any and all medications, which I feel is too often the focus of physicians, to push drugs. For that reason, I canât say that I ever have complete trust in a doctor.  I take pretty much anything a physician might say or do with a âgrain of saltâ, always considering the possibility that the drug factor could be playing a significant role.
-1	I really think that this person may have an asian fetish and think of me as a geisha.  It really makes me feel uncomfortable.
-1	She is a fine doctor, but very busy and does not seem to spend the time necessary to think through all of the options or which option is most likely - she picks something that might be an answer and we move forward.  It's OK, I trust that she is being honest, but I don't trust that she has the right answer.
-1	I think she is very intelligent and is definitely capable of taking care of my needs. She also makes a point to pay attention to my input about things. 
-1	In general I have a distrust for my primary care physician and doctors in general. I feel this way because whenever I have had a medical issue it is rare that I get any kind of resolution or any real help. I feel that doctors are so quick to medicate and not find out what the underlying issue is creating the problem. Because any doctors are of any real help I try to avoid going to them even when I need it. It seems like no matter how many blood tests or other kinds of medical tests one gets there is never any resolution to the problem only a cover up of the problem. I feel like doctors just cover the surface and never really dig deep to understand the problem. I do believe there are rare doctors that will dig deep and get the medical problem and try to solve it, but these doctors are extremely rare. In addition I feel like doctors do not take time with their patients anymore. There is no caring. It feels like they try to see as many patients as possible and never really take the time to get to know someone and their needs. In all I can't trust doctors anymore. At one time I trusted them more but I have seen the medical profession really decline in quality of care. 
1	I have known my primary care physician for almost 10 years. He is a very honest person who believes in treating others with compassion. He would not knowingly harm or mislead his patients.
-1	When i trust my doctor, it helps to create a better relationship between the two of us. Those who distrust the doctor may end up being combative, and that is not conducive to good health. Of course, trusting your doctor starts when you have a good doctor that is professional
1	He makes the time to talk with me and ask me if I have any questions. He never seems to be in a rush or rush me. He has made good decisions for me in the past.
-1	As a human being I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, unless they prove otherwise. As far as regarding my relationship with my primary physician, I would say it is mostly trustworthy. But I do not put pass anybody moving in a way of their own benefit. I am in my sound mind when it comes down to my health, you can not pay enough for it, and it is very precious. So with that being said I trust me only. My health is very important for me. I try to be well versed in it myself, so I can know what is going on with me. My body is my temple.
1	I trust my primary care physician, in part because my father, who was also a physician had recommended him. All my interactions with him are positive and he has genuine concern and interest in my health.
-1	I just had my first appointment with my new provider so I don't know him well, but he was very thorough and organized, however when I told him my L4 dermatome below my knee was numb he googled it with me and as he was doing so said he didn't think that was the L4 dermatome. It was. Then he googled a few conditions in front of me and suggested I might have diabetes. I live a pretty healthy active lifestyle and have no other symptoms, and diabetes numbness usually starts in hands and feet and is tingly or painful. I am on a soccer team of physical therapists and they all checked me out and said it was likely a contusion or compression. My sister checked me out and said the same thing. I asked about diabetes and they all thought that was ridiculous. Why was he googling so many things in our appointment? Just say you're not sure, I don't expect you to know everything, but making things up, reaching, or googling diagnoses (which I already did more effectively, not webmd nonsense) doesn't instill confidence. But he seemed like he genuinely wanted me to leave feeling taken care of, and that's more than a lot of doctors.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I've been going to her for quite some time and she's been pretty good at keeping me healthy. She knows my health and my needs so well, I almost feel like my chart is the only one in her file. I've asked other people in the office for their opinion on our doctor and all the responses seem to be very favorable. The office staff seems to be very knowledgeable and attentive. It really doesnât bother me to go to my primary care physician at all because I know Iâm going to feel better. 
-1	I mostly trust her, but I feel that she is very rushed and asks few questions. I feel like she does not ask enough questions. This is compared to previous doctors I've had in the past.
-1	I trust my doctor to an extent. They seem very passionate and wonderful whenever I am a patient, but it's hard to get in touch with them. They don't always have great follow through and they always seem rushed. 
1	My doctor always takes an extended amount of time to discuss all of my issues with me and make sure that I understand them. He is willing to do whatever I would like to make me feel comfortable and taken care of. He is bluntly honest and makes sure I know all of the side effects of my medications and whether or not I should be concerned about them. He has been right in every diagnosis he has given me so far. 
-1	In most doctor I don't have a whole lot of trust. This is based on my experiences in life. I have had some good experiences as well. Not all doctors are bad.
1	I have worked hard to find a physician who will listen to and believe me when I talk about my health.  My doctor not only listens but acts on what I am telling her.  I trust her because we work as a team when it comes to my health concerns.
1	I have been using my doctor since I was a child.it was our family doctor and I have kind of grown with him as I have aged.he has always been right
-1	My primary care physician is really good. She is hired by my company and not her own doctor's office, so she really cares about taking the time to listen and explain things to me. 
-1	I trust him because he has taken care of the sickness I have had and my family has had.  I do sometimes have trouble understanding what the nurses call me back about for diagnosis
-1	"I believe that doctors see a lot of people and give a lot of ""canned"" answers that are probably good advice but aren't tailored to each person individually."
1	They treat me as a friend. Being a medical professional they done use word to dum down what is being discussed. I much rather they tell me using the medical term vs trying to avoid miscommuication
1	I've been going to the same doctor since I was an infant.  He's well known in town and well liked.  He spends as much time as you need NEVER giving you the feeling that he's rushed.  Never.  He sits and listens quietly and intently to what you have to say.  Which also makes the patients outside waiting impatient and complain until they get in the room and he shows them the same patient listening to their symptoms, issues.  That's why I wait patiently when I'm waiting because I know what he's doing.  
-1	Its been a mixed bag for me some doctors are really good at what they do and others not so much, its been 5050 for me so far. its rather difficult and finding a good doctor has been inconsistent 
1	I have had my doctor for a long time. He seems my entire family and children. He is kind and patient. Makes sure you understand everything and does not rush with you.
-1	I feel I can trust my primary care doctor within reason.  I do feel some of the newer drugs he tries to put me on are because he gets some sort of kick back.  I question if these drugs are really in my best interest or in his.  I also feel that sometimes he doesn't listen to what I am saying and just goes by the book.  
1	I fully trust my doctor because I know her personally outside of the doctor's office. She also delivered our child and I have seen her in action. I trust her.
1	My primary care physician belongs to a practice which both myself, my wife and several of our friends have been patients in for many years. They have great reputations in the community. Additionally, my physician has excellent bedside manners, is very easy to talk to and always asks if there is anything that they can do better during the course of my visits. My primary care physician makes me feel comfortable and secure in knowing that they are giving the best attention possible.
1	I typically trust my doctor and am not afraid to raise concerns if I do not agree with something she says or does.  She typically puts my concerns first and knows that I like to weigh all of my options when it comes to making any decisions.  I am not afraid to find another doctor if I do not agree with the way any of my medical problems are being handled and any doctor I see I make sure and let them know.
-1	I know doctors just want to push pills most of the time. I have been fortunate to find a doctor who would rather treat me with something natural first before going to extreme measures. I have had doctors int he past who just want to prescribe something and want you to stick to it no matter what.
-1	I fully believe she is doing her best, The current health care system piles workloads on top of the short supply of doctors. Due to the high workload and the short amount of time available for each patient they are not nearly as thorough as one would like. Also due to time constraints and information sharing problems they are almost never up to date on your files and past Labs, ext. They put out health fires but do little to promote general good health and long term goals. I also feel there is a long gap between current medical research and what is being practiced at the physician level, i believe in the worst cases there are old doctors practicing the medicine they learned in college, when 30 years of new science is being ignored. 
-1	I trust doctors because they are extremely knowledgeable but they can make mistakes because they work in a fast pace high stress environment
1	I trust her because she is extremely personable, takes her time to really understand ALL my symptoms. She discussed different options and different ways of handling everything and gives me a set of difference choices based on my needs. She even seeks out sheaper medications due to my low income
1	I'VE BEEN SEEING THE SAME DOCTOR FOR OVER 15 YEARS AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND FORTHCOMING WITH ME. THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE TIME I CAN THINK OF WHERE I QUESTIONED WHAT I WAS TOLD REGARDING MY HEALTH
-1	I like my doctor to take their time and sometimes that doesn't happen.  But, she does what she can.  She answers questions and perscribes what is needed.  
-1	I neither trust nor distrust my primary care physician. I believe in looking at the relevant information around you in a skeptical, but pragmatic way. You must neither let your suspicions about doctors fool you into not taking their advice all the time nor should you overly trust everything they tell you. It is, after all, completely up to you in the end to come upon the best course of action concerning your health.
-1	Doctors are human.  Yes, they are highly trained and can have lots of experience, but mistakes still happen.  Sometimes it's a simple fault, and sometimes it's due to complacency.  In any case, I bear the responsibility for my health, not them.  They can make suggestions and offer advice, but it is ultimately up to me what happens to maintain my health.
-1	I have issues with my primary care physician.  I scheduled sick visits (reluctantly, because it is so expensive) only to come out of the office with more questions than I started with.  Recently I went in for issues with my hands and I knew the diagnosis the doctor gave me was completely off the mark.  He spent very little time examining me.
1	The doctors I have had throughout my life have always been good to me.  I have never had any problems with them.  I am very confident in them no matter what the situation is.
-1	It is really hard for me to trust anybody. Also, a lot of doctors are only out for themselves. However, I have had about 8 surgeries and all of my surgeons were awesome and I trust the surgeons! 
-1	 I generally have trust in my doctor's motives. I have bad reactions to some prescribed medications but, the doctor was not careless or incorrect in prescribing them for me.  The two bad experiences I had were; a doctor who wanted to do a surgical procedure in office with local anesthesia that, as I found out when I had it done in hospital, would have likely killed me if I had allowed him to proceed, and a doctor who took a phone call while suturing me and allowed a poorly trained nurse to finish the job. Big scar! I have had many more doctors who went the extra mile and saved my life or health through being extra thorough with my diagnosis.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing her for over five years and she has never given me information I have found to be false.  She discusses health issues with me and takes my concerns into consideration
1	My doctor has my best interests at heart and u believe this to be true because he shows genuine interest in my well being and my day to day life decisions that may affect my health and self worth
1	My doctor is human like, not robot like. They show they care. They show that they aren't perfect but they try to do what is best for me.
-1	I trust my physician to be analyzing any potential issues and recommending appropriate and safe treatments for me in order to recover.
1	I believe that most doctors are good hearted; they do their best for the patient, Iâve only have a few bad moments with some doctors, but in general they are to be trusted.
-1	I sometimes feel doctors are overbooked and a result hurry too much with each patient. I also feel that sometimes they are a bit too confident in what they think and dont explore other options well enough just to be safe.
1	He has taken the time out to really make sure I understood concepts by drawing pictures, which I haven't experienced with other doctors. He is against the use of certain medications that are addictive, but the most helpful in situations. I needed an anti anxiety medicine that would help and he preferred to prescribe medicine that did not really help rather than giving me medicine that absolutely would. 
1	I have had my doctors for several years now. We've built a relationship and I do trust them to share information with me freely and that we will choose the best course of action together. 
1	My primary caregiver has been honest and straight forward since my first visit years ago. I visited for a large splinter that had become infected in my leg. Instead of recommending a costly incision to remove it, he first recommended antibiotics to help the swelling go down with hopes to remove it naturally. I appreciate someone who goes down every possible path to ensure you get the care you need, not the most expensive.
-1	Doctors are human. Most of them are careful and want to help their patients. Some are better at keeping up-to-date with the newest best practices than others. So, depending on how many doctors are in your area and how good your insurance is, most people who can afford medical care can find a decent doctor who keeps their best interests in mind.
1	My doctor seems to be very personable and has my best interest in mind.  She is very down to earth and is someone I can talk to easily.  I think she is doing what is best for my current health, and I know she is educated to make those decisions.  Doctors in general I have dealt with I usually trust.  There have been a few exceptions, but if I don't have a good fit I seek a 2nd opinion.
-1	I feel like they see so many patients in a given day, that they do not remember you on a personal level, therefore they do not really have a clue what you're really going through.  I trust what they think based on ME having to point out every single little symptom I experience.  
-1	Personally, I distrust my primary care doctor because she is always in a hurry and rarely takes the time out of to fully listen to me. She is always leaving the room and doing multiple things at once not being fully immersed in my care. 
-1	I trust my care physician because they go above and beyond what I expect or what I am even interested in.  My physician is completely thorough during my physical and I feel like they want to give the best care possible.
-1	Reasons I trust doctors would be because they have more knowledge and experience in the medical field as well as medical problems. Reasons I distrust doctors, would be because sometimes they want to just prescribe medication instead of getting to the root cause of a medical condition.
1	I had the chance to review other physicians before choosing the actual one. I have also learned from a close family ember about my doctor's qualities. He indeed proved to be very professional and also close to his patients.
1	I feel like my doctor has always taken the time to listen to my concerns and address them. He doesn't blow off what I say even if it takes us a little while to figure out what is going on.
1	All of my physicians are thorough, personable, and genuine. They never make me feel rushed or like they only do things that are convenient for them. They always provide me with extensive information while weighing in on the pros and cons of each possible outcome. 
-1	Faith based, honest, she is very thourough when I come in to see her seems concerning. The nurses aid is very helpful as well. If u don't have trust in your doctor then you need to change
-1	in the past she has misdiagnosed me when i was having pain problems, but most of the time she has been very thorough and good
-1	Doctors are taught to go by numbers or by what testing says.  They do not listen to what their patients symptoms.  I have hypothyroidism and have normal numbers but I still have symptoms.  My doctor insists that my symptoms have nothing to do with my thyroid.  I have done my own research and know for a fact that other thyroid patients have symptoms despite having normal numbers.   I wish my doctor would listen to my symptoms and not my numbers
-1	I believe that my doctor has my best interests in mind but at times they have to many patients and to many things going on and they make quick decisions that may not always be the right one even if they think it was at the time  
-1	its happen couple times when i went to my primary care physician she was wrong about my illness then i had to ask her about it and then she used to prescribe other medicine. i dont trust now days to doctors. most of them look in google for clues.   
1	I have been with my PCP for over 20 years and we have pretty much grown up together (HA).  She is very careful and complete in her care for me.  She has usually been right is her recommendations for any treatment I have needed.  However, I always will retain my right to make my own healthcare decisions if I disagree with her recommendation.
-1	I trust because he has valued me in a correct way and I consider him to be a capable person since he has experience and many patients have been valued by him and I feel satisfied with this
1	I trust my primary care physician. My primary care physician always tells me what is going on with my health and answers all of my questions. She recommends things and tells me how I might feel during procedures which turned out to be true.
-1	My primary care doctor is new to me, so Iâll answer about doctors in general. I have a lot of experience with doctors, and for the most part I think they are honest and trustworthy. But I know that in a busy clinic that has a lot very ill patients, there is  a lot of shuffling of priorities. One day you may have the doctorâs full attention, other days you may not. Also, Iâve had enough errors in my treatment over the years (none fatal) to know that doctors and nurses are not infallible. They prescribe the wrong dosage, or donât fully investigate drug interactions, etc.
1	I know him personally as a friend and have worked with him in the past, before he was a doctor. So I also know him professionally.
-1	Because there decision is made off of generals. They are not specialist. If I tell my PCP that I am not overweight but I eat well(veggies, all organic) they will at the end tell me to eat better. 
1	I have a holistic doctor, who is a trained MD and oriental medicine practitioner. I trust her guidance and follow her instructions, but I don't ignore my own intuition if it conflicts with what she says.
-1	I just started with a new doctor and I like her a good bit. However, this has not been the case in general with doctors giving me medications without telling me what exactly they're meant to solve, what interactions I should be aware of, or what side effects to expect. I end up doing a tremendous amount of googling to make sure I'm not missing something. 
-1	I trust them because they know more than me but am still apprehensive at times. As long as they listen to me. 
-1	I have never had problems with them.  They always listen to me, as they know I have some medical background, and then we discuss options.  I always leave appointments knowing that it was the right decision.
1	The doctor I have now asks about the family and seems to remember things about them. Seems to care about me taking care of myself. That comes across in his tone and approach to the visits.
-1	Doctors now days are taught to get a patient in and out.  Very few take the time to really hear what you are saying and even fewer spend the time that is needed to find out what the root problem is.  They usually give you some med and it is just a band-aid and you will have to come back at a later time.  Some older physicians still take time but most of the young ones do not.
1	I trust my physician because they never rush me. I trust my physician because they always take time to explain complicated diagnoses or procedures to me. I trust my physician because they always smile whenever we interact. I trust my physician because they are great with going the extra mile to make sure I confident in my healthcare decisions by making sure I fully understand and risks associated.
-1	I feel like doctors today are too busy.  They aren't thorough on examinations and do not make sure you understand what they are telling you.  Their practice earns money in volume so they move people in and out as fast as possible.
-1	I distrust the medical profession because it is one solely funded by and has become the face of big pharma, who pushes its poisonous pills via sales bonuses to doctors who write a certain number of scripts. The medical profession as it stands is a front for the biggest drug cartel that is responsible for more deaths than any other, the fda and big pharma  
1	I completely trust my Doctor because my Doctor haven't given me any reason not to. My Doctor has never prescribed me something or recommend any kind of treatment that I was skeptical of, everything my Doctor has said to me I didn't really have reason to question it.  
-1	I don't distrust my doctor, but he's human and no one knows everything. When it comes to my health, if its a serious issue not just a cold, I always want to get another opinion. 
-1	It is not that I do not trust my doctor as much as I am aware that he is human, has a lot on his plate and is therefore subject to error.  I do believe in getting a second option when I don't believe that a concern is been met.
1	My doctor has shown to be really caring and trustworthy over the years that I have known him. He has never led me wrong and always seems to know what he's talking about involving my health.
-1	Like I stated before, sometimes I feel as if physicians are so overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people they are seeing that they do not conscientiously take the time they should to sit and explain, question, discuss with their patients. My parents have both been on the bad end of their primary care physician not doing what he was supposed to do. One time he even made a very bad prescription for my mother that could have been very deadly if the pharmacist had not caught the mistake and called him on it. Physicians are trying to see too many and utilizing the factory model that the United States has fit to everything from labor to schools to prisons.
-1	I researched my condition and I was given a treatment plan that included medication and one that included a natural change in my diet. This was the same research that I did prior to consulting with my doctor. Thus, no medication or plan is being forced upon me. Also, I was able to express my discomfort with the medication that I was using and I was switched to a different medication. 
-1	I trust them for the most part. It's an extreme amount of school and experience required to be one so they aren't messing around. Though, sometimes, they are in a rush and your problem may be really low acuity in their eyes so they may hastily treat you.
1	I haven't been to my primary care physician in a while due to no longer having health insurance, but I'll do my best to explain. I typically take good care of myself and try to avoid going to the doctor's office at all costs. The main reason that I would visit her is because of my IBS, which is something that she also suffers from, so I know that she understands what I'm going through. More generally, you never feel like you're being rushed. She always listens to whatever you need to say about your issues, no matter how long you go on about it.
-1	So far Iâve only had minor medical issues and in all cases the doctors have been very willing to explain everything and answer all my questions.
1	I trust my primary physician because she knows me really well. She has been my doctor since I was 4 years old so she knows the ins and outs of all my health issues better than any other doctor. On a personal level, she has been there for me in times of need and has gone above and beyond her call of duty.
1	In a couple of different appointments, I've asked about certain treatments or options for ailments and my doctor is very forthcoming.  Normally if he thinks it's overpriced hogwash, he'll give me his honest opinion.  He's also happily given me referrals to doctor's offices and recommendations to quality referrals for things that are recommended like an annual skin screening to proactively prevent skin cancer.  I think sometimes doctor's can be a little pill happy to offer them unnecessarily, but mine is usually more calculated and cares about finding a solution. In addition, his thoroughness actually saved a friend's life of mine when she had been complaining and struggling through a health problem with her other doctor, he uncovered a serious situation and got her the care she needed.
1	In general I trust my primary care physician. I haven't had a reason ever to distrust him. He has always been helpful and courteous, I think the care is of good quality.
1	I think that my primary care physician sometimes doesn't take my interests into account. That makes me feel like my doctor isn't completely trustworthy. I have told them about how I've tried solutions that they suggest, but I am not receiving alternative solutions after saying so.
1	I like my primary care physician, he treats me fairly and gives me good advice. He also lets me know when he feels I need to do something to improve my health.
1	I like my COP because he seems to care. He doesn't rush me. If he's unable to give me an answer, he has no issue Googling it to figure out a good solution instead of insisting it's not true or he knows better. His humour doesn't hurt either. 
-1	My doctor has found and been able to diagnoses what other doctors just left untreated..I completely trust my Doctor and his team of staff.I would recommend anybody and everybody to my doctor.
1	the dr I refer to is my oncologist who has treated me for Stage IV breast cancer that is metastatic.  It will be 6 yrs in July that I was diagnosed and also had major surgery to remove a mass in my colon that was also cancerous.  I feel without their careful and thoughtful medical expertise I may not be alive.  I see my oncologist to check my lab levels and also to receive the next round of oral chemotherapy.  I feel it is in my best interest to trust him and I do.
-1	I donât anyone should have complete trust in doctors. Different doctors can offer different opinions. A lot of doctors are also in the pocket of large pharmaceutical companies. 
1	I trust my doctor to some extent where she is trying to give me medicine and helping me stay healthy but at the same time my total belief is in God.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel like she dismisses a lot of what I say except for what she wants to hear and treat. For example, I suffer from depression and anxiety and all she does is prescribe medication that doesn't work. Sometimes my anxiety is out of control and I get very little sleep. I have a medication that is not working for me and she just keeps adjusting the dosage and it still doesn't help. This has been going on for over a year. She takes my high blood pressure and cholesterol very serious but doesn't give me much help other than a diet and exercise and medicine. The practice has also become much more busy than it used to be and I feel like sometimes her mind is someplace else because of that.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been our family doctor for more than 15 years and all his diagnostics and treatments have been accurate. He always gives us advises and we feel that he cares about our well being.
-1	I do have a primary care physician. She and I have known each other for many decades. We frequently disagree with each other, though I'm confident that she has my best interests in heart...but her business office, my insurance, other third parties, et al. that are mostly concerned with their bottom-line can and do interfere.
-1	Sometimes doctors recommend certain medications because they get a percentage of the revenue and I dont like it because they could probably recommend something cheaper to you but they just want to make money
-1	I trust my primary care physician as she is very thorough and wants to help get down to why something is bothering you.  I don't always trust that she is 100% present as she is very busy, only works two days a week, and has a packed schedule. I frequently have to wait a very long time while at the appointment before I see her, and I wonder how focused she is.  I feel like I'm inconvniencing her with my issues.
-1	I mostly trust my PCP. Of all the doctors I've seen in my life, he's better than most when it comes to listening to my problems and trusting that medical issues I bring up need to be addressed; a lot of doctors I've seen will try to explain away symptoms or avoid doing more tests. But even he's not perfect, although maybe his medical judgment and my instincts may sometimes be in conflict.
1	My primary care physician has always helped me with my problems or illnesses.  She is conservative and will start with the easiest remedy to see if that works first but is always open to taking the next step.  She listens to and answers my questions and seems to care about me.
-1	He spends a long time with me and makes sure I have a lot of reading material to take home. He makes sure in depth that everything is okay and makes sure to run regular tests.
-1	I think she is fine. Sometimes rushed or doesnât always listen to what I want or make me feel heard, but does what she can.
-1	When I offer another doctors opinion he immediately tells me they are wrong without explanation. He prescribes medications like they are candy. He gets very angry and impatient with questions or not understanding. He refuses to hear the issues I am there to see him for in full. I am cut off and he starts a physical exam instead of hearing me out. 
1	My doctor I have know for almost 20 years, he is always been friendly and trusting and I have never once had an issue with my care. He always has been honest and helped me through anything I have come across. He always makes me feel like I am a priority.
-1	The Primary Care physician I saw for 12 years moved too far away for me to see him regularly or when I'm sick.  I changed to someone in the same group but closer geographically. It's a totally bad fit!  He goes by the numbers and doesn't really listen to what's going on with me like symptoms, etc.  He refers me to specialists for health care problems he should be able to manage.  He is very quick to write prescriptions for problems that require more examination and assessment. The practice wants patients to use a patient portal to message doctors.  He answers my questions in very short, often, one word answers. I'm already shopping for a new primary care physician.   
-1	My husband and I have the same doctor.  She always does and suggests many solutions to any problem we are experiencing.  The always trouble shoots are issues, and suggest tests.  I feel that she genuinely cares about her patients.
1	I trust my particular primary care physician because she is a friend of mine.  Most importantly, I trust her character.  I know that she cares deeply for people and takes her job very seriously.  I know that she has done a great deal of personal research on many health topics, especially those pertaining to women and children.  She also takes a holistic approach to medicine which I appreciate.  
1	I for the most part trust my primary care physician. They always seem to give me the best information and always give me the correct treatment for my illnesses. 
-1	For the most part, I trust my current primary care physician because her medical examinations always seem thorough enough, and she has always prescribed medications and treatments that have turned out to be helpful and never harmful. However there are a few issues I've brought up repeatedly that have not particularly been addressed. I assume that she believes those issues are not a big deal; whether they are as harmless as she seems to think, I can't be sure since I'm no medical expert. For now I'd prefer to just go along with her advice. I have been seen by some very poor quality physicians in the past, and my PCP is definitely not one of those. I generally don't put a lot of trust in people, but I trust my PCP more than most.
-1	I do trust my doctors. I went to the same doctor for 21 years and when I turned 21 I was referred to a new doctor by my old doctor who I had good communication with and I believe that he referred me to a new doctor because he understood what I needed as a patient and that this doctor could help me. 
-1	I don't totally trust my primary care physician mostly because I don't know him well enough. He took over when my long time primary care physician retired. What I do know of him is that he is nice enough but always in a hurry and I swear he just looks at his computer and checks off what blood tests I need. If he touches me physically at all it is to listen with his stethoscope and to feel my neck. That's it. Not that I want him to examine every part of me every time, but maybe a bit more thoroughness and a human touch? It's a good thing I'm proactive because if I didn't mention and point out specific problems that should be obvious to a trained physician, I don't think he'd notice.
1	My primary care doctor is always willing to take as much time as we need at each appointment to cover all of my medical concerns. She is also always willing to listen to any concerns I have and doesn't brush me off.
-1	I've only had one bad doctor in all my experiences with medical professionals. And he was an eye doctor with his own private practice that strung me along, to get me to keep taking many tests. I ended up seeing optometrists at the mall (eye glasses store) and she fixed my problem after one appointment. So now I rather go to a popular and well-known location to see a doctor, if it isn't a clinic or hospital. 
1	I assume that our doctors are trustworthy. They undergo a minimum of seven years of postgraduate schooling, pass rigorous tests and are responsible for our health and the health of our families. But in recent times there are few cases in which doctors are not considering as trustworthy. So I think it is better to check few things before preferring doctor.There are several doctor-rating websites where patients share their reviews and experiences with physicians.
1	I trust my doctor I have been going to him for about 10 years if he has any doubt about what is wrong he refers me to a specialist. 
-1	I have had plenty of experiences with doctors where they don't even seem to exam whatever concern you have, they just brush it off or prescribe something so that they can get on with their day. Rather than really looking into something, i think they'd rather just treat everything as if its routine even if it isn't. Add on the fact that I can walk into a doctor's office and see a cutout of a pharmaceutical that they are being paid to push and it makes me feel like they're here to be salesmen instead of helping.
1	"The doctor has a very caring way about him, and he has a long history of success as a doctor, as well as the proper training and eductation. He is very open and honest with me. I chose ""agree"" instead of ""strongly agree"" above though, because I don't completely trust anyone who isn't a dear friend or loved one, and I am not a medical expert."
-1	I trust my doctor, although sometimes I feel patient care is just a revolving door to them. They see thousands and thousands every year, day an day out. Sometimes it is hard to get them to call you back or even schedule an appointment that has to be months away. I have seen a lot more younger doctors over the years that have more energy and stamina to take on new patients than the doctors that have been around for decades. There needs to be a change in primary care.
-1	I am cautiously trusting of my doctor's care for me, following up with questions if there are areas I feel she has not covered or been as thorough as needed. 
1	I trust my physician completely. I have been sing the same doctor for many years. He knows were I stand with taking non nonessential medications, and antibiotics. I believe he respects that. He has never steered me wrong before. I have also never had any health issues other than an occasional cold. I also believe that a good education in the medical field is also a must have. My doctor has taken many courses and is very well rounded. He has a great amount of experience.  
1	I haven't had too many experiences with doctors, let alone bad experiences. I trust doctors for the most part and tend to take whatever medicine they provide me with. But if that medicine isn't working, I'll start to doubt my doctor.
-1	I don't currently have a primary care physician because I switched insurance providers and still need to select one.  Basically, I've seen too many things go wrong with friends and relatives' doctors, and I'm pretty paranoid about doctors in general. I inherently don't trust them and want to avoid them. Also, I think I have a form of hypochondria where I'm always afraid of something being wrong and so just want to avoid it.
-1	I've had family members with doctors who have rushed them thru things, misdiagnosed or allowed very serious illnesses to remain undiagnosed, and not been careful enough in prescribing and monitoring the effect of medications. There are good doctors but I think in the US nowadays if you want to be assured you're getting the best care possible from your physician then you must be vigilant and persistent. I would be wary of any doctor even tho I know most don't mean to cause harm.
1	I've been going to the same doctor my entire life and he's always been a great help in helping diagnose and eliminate the various viruses, infections, and flues that I caught throughout in my life. I've had no reason to not trust him for the entirety of my life. So, ever since I was a child, I've learned to trust my doctor.
-1	I've had a really devastating loss because my doctor suck. Or it's all my fault, and my body is just terrible. I really don't want to think about it, honestly.
-1	I believe my doctor as well as the majority of doctors do keep my best interest in mind. To be in such a field shows and proves that they care about people's well being in general. I feel it is more of the patient who do not follow through with doing what is right for them
1	I trust my doctor because she listens carefully to me, asks appropriate questions and does not dismiss my concerns.  She takes the time to get all pertinent information and thinks about my particular case before diagnosing or prescribing anything.
1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I do feel that the majority of doctors are going to try their best to do what is in the best interest of their patients. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she listens to my concerns and provides clear explanations and suggestions on how to overcome them.
-1	I was misdiagnosed with a condition for years and doctors refused to test for it. I have encountered many doctors and some understand more than others.
1	She spends a good deal of time with me during my appointments.  I never feel rushed, and she appears to genuinely listen when I ask her a question.  I'm also able to carry on a constructive dialogue with her, where I share my own opinions.
-1	I trust my doctor because they do not make me feel dumb about the questions I ask and are always willing to answer more questions I have.
-1	"For the most part I do trust my Dr, but at times I feel like she is rushed. Last time I was there I had told her that I had hurt my back and my chiropractor did a MRI and I found out I had degenerative disc disease. I asked her if she had someone she would refer me to if I needed injections. She acted like it wasn't a big deal and said ""ya, we dot that all the time."" I guess I would have felt better if she had asked to obtain a copy of the MRI (or look to see if she had it, as I gave her name when it was done) and look at the extent of damage and give me some names. I also feel like she doesn't look at previous issues and see if I have had any symptoms relating to those. "
-1	I basically trust my primary care physician because she is extremely experienced and seems caring, and her treatment recommendations seem appropriate.
-1	I trsut my primary care doctor for the most part. However, i do feel as though they rush me out and dont take as much time as necessary.
1	I have full trust in my PCP. I have never in all the years I have been seeing her had one issue. She always makes me feel comfortable and answers all questions and concerns I have. She doesn't always take drastic measures but takes things slow to get to a solution. 
1	They haven't let me down yet. I trust them because every time i went to them with a problem, they always took care of it. They always manage to give me what i need to fix my problem without any negative side effects
-1	Again, it comes down to the fact that people can lie.  People on this planet have an ultimate goal in mind and that is to make money.  So, if a doctor is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and are essentially drug dealers, how could you trust that person ever?
-1	It it their job and I like to believe they have moral standards and wouldnt sway me towards something wrong.
-1	For the most part, I do trust my primary care physician.  I believe the physician has my best interest overall.  That being said, I still question my doctor on certain decisions to make sure I agree with the decision.  I am not afraid to question my doctor or do more research about certain decisions my doctor wants me to follow.
-1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. They spend ample time listening to any symptoms or issues that I have to present before making any form of diagnoses or prescribing medications. They also take the time to fully explain any diagnoses to me at that time. 
-1	The medical field in my observation us more focused on insurance and getting paid well rather than helping people. It is all about how much money the medical field can get and with insurance how much the insurances can save on patients.
-1	i trust him too much because of the years, what he has advice me had never proving to be false. he is so caring and approachable. he tell me what is needed and not what i wants to hear. he is such a wonderful man. also he put patience first before money.
1	My doctor is a very down to earth person. I think that he and I have a lot in common. We are able to talk freely with him and have agreed on almost everything that we have every talked about. The decisions that he has made thus far I have agreed with and would anticipate that he would continue to make decisions in the future that I agree with.
1	I found from my past experiences that my primary care physician treatment opinions are best for my good health. As the result I have full trust in my primary care physician.
-1	My doctor usually rushes through, spends bare minimal time with me.  He makes me feel like I don't know my own body. He usually tries to push his opinions on me. 
-1	In general, I trust my primary care physician. I think she is trying her best to provide good medical care to meet my  needs.  However, I think sometimes she may not listen to my point of view and may instead rely on her own experiences and training too much, as opposed to seeing what may work uniquely for me as an individual.  However, I do feel like she cares and does a thorough job overall.
-1	I trust my primary care physician she is always so helpful and nice. She has been with me for a very long time. Ive been with her for over 10 years. She has helped me through a lot of medical issues I have had.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because so far she has not given me any reason not to trust her. She has really good online reviews and so far my experiences with her have been pleasant.
1	My Primary Care physician is incredible. She's relatable and kind and takes the time to address any concerns I have. I trust her completely.
-1	I think that they are not intentionally trying to do wrong by me. However, I do know that doctors often do not have the time to keep up to date with all of the latest advances in healthcare. So it's important to double-check any recommendations yourself.
1	I trust my primary care because I have to be able to rely on them to help me make informed medical decisions.  I also need to be able to trust my doctor to explain to me the best course of action.
-1	Generally, i do trust my physician, but I also feel that they see me so rarely, and see so many other patients, that they are not able to provide the best recommendation.
-1	I distrust my doctor because I feel that I'm just a check to them. I sometimes leave feeling that nothing had been accomplished by my visit and that my suggested treatment was the most convenient for them. I've also been misdiagnosed at least once to my knowledge.
-1	When I had serious medical complications, my doctor sent me to a specialist rather than trying to deal with the situation himself. I feel confident that he actually cares about my well-being.
-1	I place trust in my doctor, but have not done so blindly. I take everything with a grain of salt, at least initially. I have been with my PCP for a significant amount of time now, an dI understand and trust their judgement when it comes to matters of my health, though I could not say the same for other doctors with whom I am not a patient. I mainly base my trust on my experience with my PCP, which has been by far one of the best 'professional' relationships I have had in my life.
-1	I have only had one bad experience with a doctor and that was more about billing and paperwork than the actual care. When a doctor gives me an opinion I generally accept it and follow their advice. So far in life that has not let me down.
-1	I have had bad experiences in the past with doctors and i have learned what to look out for when it comes to bad care.
-1	I generally trust my doctor but I feel like with the workload they have that sometimes I need to be responsible in following through or asking the right questions in order to make sure I get the right help.
1	there have been times in the past I thought the doctor was not taking my high cholesterol as serious as they should.  However,  I changed my diet and worked out and brought  my level down without medicine so I am glad I did not rely on the drugs. 
-1	I want to be able to fully trust my doctors but sometimes when I ask for further information about my specific problem, they don't seem to want to go into details which makes me doubt them. I also feel when they try to lump things to past problems I've been dealing with instead of looking at the problem individually I begin to distrust their judgement. 
-1	I trust my PCP and one other doctor. Following that, I usually trust male docs I donât know if he doesnât jump into the examination and gives me time to feel him out. Talks a bit, etc. I canât trust women doctors. :( (Personal history). To be fair, I donât have a feeling that most are not in it for the right reason, not as a business venue.
-1	My dr and i believe that most dr's are too by the book.  They see a person as a payment or a number rather than an individual. This causing them to just use us as test subjects to kind of see what works rather than really getting to know us and our bodies. 
1	I don't see my PCP often, but when I do he is very straightforward with me. He expresses his concerns if he has any. He then gives a list of options for treatment(s) and allows me to decide which course to follow. If there are any issues I have a variety of ways in which I can reach out to him and he is prompt at responding.
-1	The doctor has a quota of patients that he has to see to make a profit for the day. this leads to the doctor spending less time than is possibly needed to fully aid a patient
-1	I feel like the physician is more oriented towards actions that would bring the hospital more revenues and comfort.  The physician does not seem to truly listen to all that I have to say and makes judgments and diagnoses before fully understanding the problems.
-1	I feel like my doctor is in a hurry. She is wanting to get through with the exam and move on to the next patient. If I ask a question, she rushes through the answer. I can always tell she is focused on getting to the next person. So I don't necessarily trust her to be thorough or careful.
-1	I trust my doctor, all in all i have gotten what i needed from him. He's always been right about my health and given me the right medication. The only thing is that he's always in a rush wished he would spend a little more time answering my questions.
1	I do feel at ease with my doctor. I have known her for many years so she knows how my body reacts to things. How I feel about things. I believe in her judgement. 
1	I trust them for the most part because they know what they're doing and generally want me to get better. The only thing I dont trust about my doctor is the brands of prescription medicine they push because I know some medication gives them bonuses while others don't so I have to research the medications myself to see which is right for me
-1	For the last several years I have primarily seen a pain management specialist.  I feel like it has been write a prescription rather than deal with the problems. Then when the attitudes began to change about medicating chronic pain patients it became trying to stop giving me medication. At no time have I felt my best interests were served.  I would prefer a more middle of the road approach. 
1	I have seen her for a long time and she's consistently shown a lot of care. She always listens to my questions, even the seemingly silly sounding ones, and answers honestly.
-1	I feel i can trust my PCP. She is being very honest with me about options and potential results. I feel i already established a personal connection with her
-1	I want to have full trust in my primary doctor but I feel like some training is outdated.  I feel that pharmaceutical companies influence doctors greatly.  I've experienced a situation where I was not given all my options and I feel surgery was recommended and pushed to make money.  I feel like it's too much about making money and less about making people healthy.  Especially considering the fact that Americans are growing more and more unhealthy - kids and adults alike.
1	I have known this person for a few years now, and I trust his judgement. I have felt that he is interested me as a person, not just a chart. I feel I could talk to this person about anything going on in my body.
-1	My doctor recently left her practice so I will be seeing a new doctor. In addition, I always feel that a doctor is trying to get through as many patients as possible. 
-1	I have the utmost trust in the group of  nurse midwives that I see for my primary gynecological care and for the birth of my son.  I believe their values perfectly align with my own and I trust them implicitly with medical decisions.  I trust most doctors less.
-1	"Almost all primary-care physicians are driven by market forces and social need to see more patients per day than they really should. I think this leads them to make ""snap"" decisions without spending a lot of time considering possible alternatives; the ""easy"" answer isn't always the right one. I sometime distrust my doctor's opinion when I feel he wants to rush through answers or complicated diagnoses without really considering whether they're totally correct or whether I understand them fully. I recognize their dilemma, but will not allow it to stop me from getting all the info I need on my medical condition."
-1	"Sometimes I'll get different feedback from a different provider of mine that makes me question who is right or who is wrong. Or I'll bring up something I read online or heard from others with similar conditions and the physician will say ""Yes, that is an option."" I don't like to have to be the one to bring up other things."
-1	I would definitely trust my health care physician because they are the people I could ask help whenever I feel sick. My health care physician was the reason why i am still standing in this planet. I have a good relationships with her and also to my family since when I was young.
-1	I feel like I need to trust them because that is what they have studied and trained to do for many years. Though I have experienced negative situations in hospitals that have made me feel somewhat distrustful. I have been present in situations where a doctor has taken too long or has not demonstrated much importance when trying to be reached with questions. Sometimes they have so many situations going on at once, that it would seem they forget some patients.
1	I trust my doctor because I have read reviews about him. I also trust him because I myself have checked up on the internet the treatment and procedures that he has suggested or prescribed. 
-1	Doctor has given bad advice a couple of times, such as don't read about side effects. I don't have anything else to say.
-1	My Primary Care Physician is an exception to the rule. Nearly all other physicians I've encountered would have received the exact opposite scores. My physician runs a small-town cash-only clinic, removing insurance from the process altogether and creating a much better Doctor-Patient relationship in the process.
1	My doctor talks to me like a friend instead of a patient. If he needs to prescribe a medicine, he talks to me on my level of understanding about the pros and cons and tells me about his success or lack thereof with his other patients. He is very honest and open about what I do and do not need to change in reference to my lifestyle. Most importantly, if he doesn't have an answer, he is not afraid to tell me he doesn't know and needs to refer me to a specialist. That most of all is why I trust him so much - that he is willing to admit he doesn't know something or admit someone else may have a better solution.
-1	I feel like my doctors are trustworthy for the most part but sometimes I wonder if they get paid by people like drug companies to give out certain kinds of medicine for people who have problems and maybe that makes them find problems that aren't there sometimes. 
-1	I do generally trust my doctor, but I know there's a lot he doesn't know, and the same goes for most doctors. So I always supplement whatever information/recommendations he gives me with additional research to get a bigger picture. Doctors generally overprescribe medication, which usually has side effects and can do more harm than good in the long run, so I want to know exactly what I'll get into if I make a certain choice.
-1	Doctors come in an listen to you for barely 5 minutes, then do some perfunctory examinations like check blood pressure and come to a decision on your situation.  Its obvious often doctors have no clue on how to diagnose a non-visible symptom like stomach pain or neurological issues.  They just tend to prescribe yah a prescription and rush you out the door.  The prescription might do more harm than good too.  Its clear that some of the doctors I have fit this profile and aren't very circumspect or patient oriented.
1	I've known my primary care physician most of my life, and he has never given me a reason not to trust him. 
1	I moved to this city 13 years ago and have been seeing this doctor for all my health care needs, apart from my dentist and eye doctor. She answers all my questions patiently and never hurries through the appointment.
-1	I find that my PCP has a genuine interest to see that I am as healthy as I can be.  She listens to my problems and seems to expend the appropriate amount of concern and energy into solving my problems.  She will also freely give prescriptions or referrals when I need to see a specialist.
1	I been seeing my doctor for several years.  He has always been helpful and profession when my family or I are sick.
1	I trusted my former primary care physician, but I didn't put all of my trust in him. God is first in my life and my trust is in Him, but to a certain degree I trusted my former primary care physician, because he always seemed to be honest in telling me about all different treatment options available and the results of my blood tests. 
-1	The primary care physicians are going to spend as little time with patients as possible.  They are busy and dont have time to explain everything or care about every patient.  If the doctor prescribes me a drug or suggests a certain treatment I will do thorough research on my own time and make my own decision about my course of treatment.
-1	The few times I have visited the doctor I have felt a sense of urgency from them as if they were too busy for my time. I also feel like they do not care as much as they should, too many times have I experienced a doctor telling me a bunch of information at once like they were a robot, not making any eye contact with me through the lecture. 
1	I have along history with my doctor and I know now i can trust him on what he says and I am always the one to ask questions and at time confirm what he says by reading more on the subject
-1	I do think that doctors for the most part have your best well-being in mind, but I'm skeptical that sometimes they may be guided by less savory interests (pharmaceuticals).
1	I trust my doctor because she is very understanding and knows me really well. She is almost like my friend and is really nice to me.
1	I trust my doctor because for the most part he has been on the mark with health problems that I have had. Once he had an intern from a local school take a look at me. She had difficulty diagnosing me so she went to get him. As soon as he walked in to the room, he saw me from a distance and called out what I had - again from a distance. He was dead right. My doctor knows his stuff and also has a sense of humor.
1	I trust my doctor because he tells me exactly what I have, why I have what I have, and how to correct my condition. He does not try to push medications on me but looks for natural solutions if possible. 
-1	I have been seeing my current primary care physician for nearly 4 years. She is very competent, compassionate, and will send me to specialists if I have medical problems that she cannot treat. 
1	I feel like I have to trust him.  I am allowing him to look after my health.  If I didn't trust that his decisions or education was good enough I would happily find a new doctor.
1	I trust her because she actually takes the time out to listen to me when I speak to her about what is going on with me.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, therefore I marked all of the above items as neutral. I've personally been friends with several doctors in my life, and the reality is they are people like everyone else, and as a result my trust in them depends on their ethics and character. Some doctors are very caring and insightful, some are full of ego that blinds them truly looking and understanding a case before them. And all degrees in between. Should I ever need to see a doctor, I will to a great deal of research on them before consenting to be their patient.
-1	I don't have much trust in my former mainstream (allopathic) doctor mainly because of the way information in allopathic medicine is taught, from a top down and 'condition-osis' perspective.  There is no such thing in mainstream medicine as understanding a situation from the ground up.  Instead, a description of a condition is projected onto the patient and care is given based on that projection.  My doctor did absolutely nothing for me in regards to my scoliosis that got so bad my entire rib cage began to slip out of place.  Instead of seeing what was there, he acted on the preconceived notion of what scoliosis was and the problems it can cause.
-1	I trust them to do their jobs. I have confidence in them unless they give me a reason not to. I believe they have their patient's best interesting in mind. 
1	I have complete faith in my doctor's abilities and believe that my well-being is at the top of their interests. I feel there is no reason to mistrust my doctor.
1	I trust my doctor because I do believe he wants to do what's best for me and really help me. I think that they always wanna do the best thing they can for their patients. They are their to help, and that's what they really try to do, in my opinion. 
1	One of the reasons I distrust a lot of Physicians is because in this day, I fear, mostly they are after money. So more test's, more this, more that, try this try that, I fear its all about the money. I wish it wasn't so. But mostly I feel this way. But not about everyone.
-1	I think in the USA Doctors have to worry too much about the bottom line, that is if people do not have high levels of insurance they will not receive all options available to them since they are unable to pay for them. 
-1	I have been misled at times and questioned my primary care physician's thoroughness and motivation. I still trust them, but would be cautious in not seeking out a second opinion in certain situations.
-1	I distrust my PCP and the conventional medical doctors because they are only trained in drugs and surgery.  It is a big business and no one is allowed to deviate from it even if the results are in the best interest of the patient. You look around and see so many people sick, how can I trust the doctors?  Doctors still think soda is ok to drink!
-1	i trust doctors for the most part because i believe many of them are inherently good people who got into the medical field in order to help be of service to others. Occasionally there are doctors who seem to be pretty detached from their work and just see all their patients as a paycheck, and that is truly an awful thing.
1	I completely trust my doctor. I believe that if you don't trust them,  u should find one that you do. Mine gives me an honest opinion, backed by facts and not just suggestions. They give me solid advise and are patient with me. They take the time to sit with u and listen to your problems and questions. Thru don't always want to shove a pill down your throat, they respect my natural path of doing things. 
1	The reason why I trust my primary care physician is because of his personality and willingness to answer any questions I would have. His explanation for his methods or recommendations are pretty reasonable and sound and he never rushes me through an appointment. 
-1	I have been recently assigned a new provider. As far as I can tell, he is a very competent doctor. He has been very helpful in my medications and I have not experienced any problems under this current provider.
1	I have had my primary physician for 20 plus years. During that time he has always listened to my concerns, shared his concerns and always made the correction decisions to improve my various health issues. He is kind and considerate and truly cares about mew and his other patients
-1	He is constricted by the corporation that employs him. He's clearly under a great deal of pressure, probably dealing with more patients than he can comfortably deal with. 
-1	i see a nurse practitioner which was new for me. i think it's a red state thing. or maybe it's the future. anyway the practitioner was able to refer me to a specialist
-1	It's not my primary care physician in particular that I distrust, It's the fact that doctors are people too and anybody can get lazy and careless at times in their profession or simply be having a bad day. I mildly mistrust all doctors until I have reasonable proof not to do so. There are problems with how the medical field is run in this country and I'm sure there are doctors out there that disgree with things they must comply to on a daily basis which can be disheartening in the longrun. Most doctors have the ability to be great, but I believe it's harder than it has to be. Overall though, I do trust my doctor because I have faith in the decision I made to choose them as my pcp based on my experience with them. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because he takes the time to talk to me about all aspects of my health, and helps me look into a multitude of treatment options, where applicable. He is very experienced, and takes the time to listen to me (which can be rare in doctors). I get the feeling that my family's and my own health are important to him.
1	I had the same doctor for the last 12 years. He has always taken good care of me. I think of him more like a family friend than just my primary care doctor. When I had lower back pain problem and couldn't sleep, he referred me to a really good chiropractor and physical therapist. I put a lot of trust in his diagnostic and advice because he is almost always correct with his assessment.   
-1	My doctor is a great doctor and she truly cares about her patients.  I have developed a good relationship with her and she lets me know that she is always there for her patients
-1	 As a poor citizen of the United States I like millions of my fellow countryman probably avoid seeing doctors as much as possible. The cost of health care is insane and the treatment that is given to lower class individuals is often not very good. I can say this from first hand experience as told in my previous statement. Doctors often seem to care more about money than about the ethical side of their profession which is to help people. I feel there is a large disconnect between healthcare needs and healthcare providers in this country. Doctors taking hand outs from pharmaceutical companies to prescribe their drugs is a huge conflict of interests. Healthcare should not be a for profit business but rather a human right. Until this concept is realized in this country and in the rest of the world who is falling behind the general public will continue to not trust doctors and not seek medical help. Going into crippling debt for simply seeing a doctor is not an option for most people.
1	I have been seeing my doctor a while, we are around the same age and she is very smart and knowledgeable. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have seen the same one for twenty years. He has always been very thorough for regarding any issue that I have. During my pregnancies he was never too pushy about what he thought was best, and let me make the decisions. He is always a good listener when it comes to my concerns, and never rushes me out of his office. 
-1	my doctor has been very open and honest with me about my health and the things i should be doing and avoiding. she does not sugar coat anything but she is also compassionate when relating her message across to me which makes me feel more comfortable and apt to listening to her medical advice.
-1	Sometimes it seems like he is pushing pharmaceutical trials on me. He does not always seem genuinely interested in my welfare, although we make small talk often.
-1	sometimes people have other things on their mind.  they see a lot of patients and might not be feeling good that day. they might not be as informed on new things out in the medical field. they may have been last in their class. there are many things that  can cause mistakes to be made. they are only human also
-1	I trust my Doctor because I believe he has been completely honest . He is willing to admit when he doesn't have the answer to all of my health concerns and doesn't hesitate to direct me to other Dr. that can treat my health problems.
-1	I'm not entirely happy with my primary care physician because he doesn't always take the time I would like him to take with me.  It is a busy practice. I am currently looking for a new doctor who will be willing to spend time answering my questions.  A doctor who will listen to me and not just assume I don't know what i'm talking about when it comes to my health.
-1	I don't have complete trust in my doctor - but I would say I trust most of what they say. I am not too big on vaccines anymore, although my daughter does get them as a safety precaution. I don't always trust the meds I am given because sometimes if I suggest something the doctor has said no out of spite. And then a few months later we try the medication I originally suggested and it works great (I am mostly talking about psychiatry there - psychiatry/psychology is a hobby of mine, luckily I have a great psych doctor now!)
1	I have been going to the same doctor for about ten years. He is very thorough and knows my medical needs. He hasn't failed me yet and has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my health.
1	I'm active duty military and see my doctor at the base hospital. I feel as though they honestly care about me and my fellow military members and do what is best for our health and long term care. I have no reasons to doubt this or experienced anything to discredit this opinion and view.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she will explain all options to me and also make sure that she understands who I am as her patient. She also makes sure that her staff is also aware of who I am as a patient. 
-1	I try to ask questions to get the best information, but am not always sure that I have done so. My primary care physician and doctors in general tend to rush appointments and have subordinates reply to me with answers that are sometimes inadequate. My trust is therefore about 50-50.
1	"I trust my medical professional because from the moment I met her, she engaged me and made me feel comfortable and relaxed.  Throughout my visits with her, I've seen her competency shine through and appreciate her honesty and her ""house tricks"" to treat more common/household illnesses.  While she may prescribe a medication, she'll also talk through other alternatives and recommendations."
-1	I always feel so rushed during consultations that I feel distrustful of his advice.  Can he really be that careful with my care in fifteen minutes?
1	My doctor takes the time to actively listen to me and to address my concerns. I don't feel like a number or like I'm being rushed. He takes the time to explain things to me in a way I understand and is empathetic to what I say.
-1	I have only been to this doctor for 2 physicals and I have not had any serious problems so it is hard to judge whether I trust her completely. She seems nice enough and she doesn't force me to do things that I disagree with her about so she seems okay. For instance I have osteoporosis and I have found a very good supplement which is used to treat osteoporosis in Japan and the doctor wanted me to take prescription meds and I refused because of the side effects. She allowed me to go the course I prefer at my own risk. We will see what will happen when the stakes are higher as far as having a more serious health problem ( which I hope does not happen any time soon). 
1	I like my doctor, we have a private practice doctor, so I feel we get lucky and get extra time he doesn't seem to rush me and I feel he listens to me when I go in to see him.  I also like that I see only him, so he can look back from last time he saw me or review his notes, that gives me confidence that something won't be missed
-1	I utilize different professional medical settings (i.e. urgent care, hospital, offices) and have had multiple bad experiences, both personal and of my friends. It seems as though many doctors rush through without properly analyzing the situation, or push for the more costly of treatments. Medicine has taken quite a plunge in recent years, and the Hippocratic Oath does not mean what it once meant. 
1	I trust her because she seems so genuine and caring. She is very thorough when giving me information and very knowledgeable. We have a lot in common and I can really relate to her. 
-1	I don't always trust everything the doctor says and seem to spend more time talking to the nurse asking questions. The doctors seem to think they know everything and don't ask many questions. I't understandable they seem pressed for time as I can understand why that would be true. I do think that is the main reson for a lack of trust though it may not always be true.
1	I trust her because she has been my doctor for Two years and even delivered my son. She has always made sure I was in good hands and made me feel comfortable to talk about my health to
1	It took me a while to get to a point where I felt okay with this doctor; my previous doctor died and I switched to the current doctor, who was in the same practice, and we clashed at first. But now we understand each other better. Also, I got treated for my trypanophobia (fear of medical needles) and since then I am better able to trust doctors in general.
-1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor. she is very attentive, always listens. So far all of her recommendations were spot on.
-1	Doctors are busy and use mental shortcuts.  There is a large body of literature showing this.  Doctors are also generally very busy and shocking self-important, with little experience in the humility that actual scientists have.
-1	The doctors who I know personally genuinely do care.So while sometimes it is a situation of covering their butts, most the time it is done for my welfare. 
-1	I'm very frank and open with her and she is with me, which is what I would expect and this makes me feel safe.  She asks tough questions and doesn't beat around the bush, gets to the point, and is very directive in what she believes is best for me.  I like this about her and am totally open with her.
-1	I trust my Physician's because he's the one that take care of me health-wise, and make sure that I am on the right path and and in good health.
1	My primary care physician has been my doctor since I was born. He always was my mom, and cousin's doctor.
-1	My primary care physician sometimes seems to be in a hurry on days when he has a lot of patients to see, so he does not ask me many questions on those days. If I have any symptoms that are bothering me, then I would have to make sure to point them out to him myself when he is in a hurry. He always prescribes treatment or orders tests to learn what is wrong, so he can prescribe accurate medicines.
1	My group of doctors work together to get me the care needed. They toss ideas around with each other so there is always a second and third opinion before we move forward with anything in the event that I do get sick.
-1	he is a doctor and he know what to do and how to treat so i trust him/her but i also do my research on it and seek out the treatment  
1	I do trust doctors in general but it's hard to find a doctor who truly cares. For example, I used to go to the doctor and I always felt rushed because he had million patients waiting in the waiting area. He is a good doctor but I like when I have enough time to tell about my problems or what I feel or my concerns and he just didn't really have time to listen. I found another doctor who is amazing. He has a small office and not a lot of patience because he really takes his time and really cares. You can call him on his personal phone number and he will answer and will try to help
1	I believe my doctor is qualified to make decisions about my medical care. They are more informed and knowledgable about healthcare than I am.
-1	I have a lack of trust with physicians when they seem to be completely distant from me when I am giving them information or explaining my situation. It boils down to them having a lack of social skills - I often feel like when I am being shooed out of an office to get me out as soon as possible, it feels as though I am not worth their time. Again, this often happens when I am at an urgent care clinic or with doctors that I am seeing for the very first time. Also, a lack of professionalism shows me that they could potentially be wrong about a prescription. 
1	I have to see doctors relatively often, and although most visits are quite short, my doctor (or the nurse) is always willing to explain something I don't understand. I believe my doctor is concerned about my health problems and prescribes the medications he feels will work the best (I often have to change medications because one isn't working or a new one causes problems with an older one).
-1	I have been going to him for years. He has always given me good advice. I trust him completely to make good recommendations.
1	He seems to know what he is doing and knows the technical terminology when we discuss my problems. He seems to have empathy as well.
1	My Dr. has always though about my good health, sometimes more than me. He declined to do a procedure because I just had it done lass the a month before and he was afraid it might cause me more discomfort.
-1	Like i previously stated i feel that physicians dont listen or care about me but only the masses and fixing a large number of people and not specifically me. So personally i feel alone and afraid because i am the only one interested in my health and well being.
1	She has entered in to a relationship with me with goal setting and holding me accountable, she's not just passive.
-1	I trust my doctor because she takes time with me. She spends more than one minute in the room with me when I go. She takes the time to not only see to my health but to ask about my personal life. She remembers me and asks me always about different things I have shared with her such as work or my personal life. 
-1	I trust my doctor for a few reasons. First off, they are a doctor for a reason, they want to help people improve their health. Also, there are plenty of laws and reasons for them to not slack off and do a bad job, so they are well incentivized to be accurate.
1	I trust her because she genuinely seems likes she wants to help and she has the knowledge to do so.  She is very kind but stern, and does talk about a lot of options I may have.  She also is quick to refer me if she knows I would be better suited with a specialist.  My only distrust would be that she is fairly young, so she does not have the experience of the more established physicians.
1	I trust my doctor because he takes a lot time with every patient to figure out how you are and what is going on.  Willing to give all the tests needed to figure out any issues.
1	I trust that my doctor is giving me all the information to the best of her ability, and wants to help me make the best decisions possible. However, she is human, and busy, and human health is complicated and constantly evolving. I do not expect her to know everything. 
1	I do have complete trust in my primary care physician, because I have been a patient of his for a long time. He is a fairly young doctor and is intelligent and knows about new technology and medications. I have always been able to get same day appointments, if needed. He has never steered me wrong on the topic of health or taking care of myself.
-1	I feel like my doctor listens to me and will do everything they can to find out what is going on with my health when I need them to. They have always listened to me. 
1	My doctor is very well educated and experienced. He is warm and approachable and always tells me the plus and minuses regarding medicines and treatments I need.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has always listened to my concerns and taken time with me,  instead of rushing through my appointments.
1	 I trust my primary care physician for several reasons. I know he has a strong educational background and has been in practice for many years. I have researched online and read reviews on my physician and they are very good reviews. My physician has always listened to me, given me good advice and treatment and I have never not benefited from his care.He has certainly earned my trust.
-1	I feel like no matter what Dr. I go to, no matter what the reviews are lie they are always just about the money. it really sucks and I feel really awkward. I always feel like the doctors dont care about there patients. I have yet to find one that actually cares.
-1	I trust them to a certain extent, but I know they are influenced by Big Pharma, and are reluctant to tell you about natural, effective treatment, and will probably try to get you on some type of prescription that you may or may not need.  In many cases these drugs can do more harm than good.
-1	I trust the doctor because he is experienced and deals with patients with similar problems. Since he is familiar in his field he will know how to treat me. 
-1	When it boils down, a doctor is still a human and all humans are prone to error.  I believe they are obviously more educated on health subject matter than me, but I don't necessarily put 100% trust that they know best all of the time. 
1	I trust doctors because ultimately, I visit them because I'm not an expert in regards to health and medicine and because they have the means to help me. They're the ones with the expert knowledge. If I do think that they're doing something questionable, I would consult yet another doctor. Furthermore, doctors tend to be high on empathy and people who study this career did it because they wanted to, no one forced them to do it. I think this makes them more trustworthy.
1	My primary care physician is a young man who takes his time talking with me and actually listens to what I have to say. He then asks relevant questions and discusses which course of action would be best for me and which he feels would best address my concerns. He is always available through his patient portal and responds in a timely manner. His staff is also very kind and caring and I get a sense that they actually quite enjoy working for him, which to me is very telling.
1	I do not trust all doctors completely. They are human and can make mistakes, and may not always have all of the answers, and may not know the entire situation. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has an excellent track record. She has consistently provided excellent care and treatment for myself and my family. She has proven her abilities over the long-term.
-1	I feel Doctor's no longer spend time engaging with their patients. It's in and out. I feel most of what's said is ignored and simply one problem is quickly looked at and guessed with what the popular treatment is at the moment.
-1	Well I dont feel like he uses enough wholistic techniques only knows medication. He isnt thorough enough. I feel like he looks at physical appearance and then does basic tests.
1	I have been with my same doctor for years. During this time, from my impression, my doctor has always been honest and forthright with me. My doctor's actions and behavior has never given me any reason to distrust him. Therefore, until I am given a reason, I have no reason not to trust my doctor.
-1	I have never had any experience to make me not trust my doctor. Most of the time I think he is trying to do what is best to treat whatever is the wrong in the most effective way.
-1	I dont completely trust my medical physician because often I feel like instead of doing what's the right thing for me they are likely doing what can get them paid the most. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because I think they are very thorough. I feel like they go through all the necessary questions to diagnose me and prescribe the right medications to help me feel better.
1	I feel like my doctor went through a lot of education and training to get to where he is now, so I feel like he probably has a pretty good understanding of my health and how to treat and maintain it
-1	I trust my physician because I did a lot of research and got some recommendations from people I trust. I made the best choice for my needs and situation. My physicians has my best interest at heart. 
-1	I have known my doctor for ten years. He has always been honest and patient with me. He was my doctor through my pregnancies also.
-1	Sometimes I feel like the doctor does not listen and treats every case or condition the same. If they have seen something like it before, or have experienced something similar before, they tend to forget that every person is an individual and may react differently to the same condition as someone else
1	My primary care physician is thoughtful and absolutely does his best to give good advice.  At the end of the day, though, medical decisions are my decision, and  I need to do my own thinking and research about serious conditions.
-1	My physician has always been very helpful in getting me any information I need, even when I am asking a lot of questions. 
-1	I find most doctors I have dealt with to be very rushed. If I explain something poorly, they get the wrong idea and prescribe the wrong treatment. They don't have enough time to do good diagnosis. So I think the doctors are good people. I also think they don't have enough time to do their jobs well. Likely, they may not be as up-to-date as they need to be with medical science.
1	I have been lucky to have always had doctors that I have complete trust in. They have always been thorough in evaluating my symptoms or issues and have taken the time to sit down and have a conversation about my options. They have always been open to questions and I have never feel rushed or felt they were putting their convenience over my well-being.
-1	I have some trust in my primary care physician but would hesitate to have full trust unless I have gone through many more health issues to see her response/care to them. I do tend to do independent research on the health issues so that i have some comparison to her response & care of the problem. So, mostly, i feel like she has been truthful and has provided adequate care. 
-1	I trust my doctor to am extent. I know he has my best interests at heart. But no doctor can keep up on all the newest medical research. So I try to supplement with my own research
1	My PCP takes time with me and asks me lots of questions.  She looks me in the eye and treats me as a person who is intelligent and capable of understanding health information and decisions.  
1	I do not go to my PCP often because they are far away but when I do go I do trust their option because they have not seared me wrong yet. It is important to be able to trust your doctor. 
-1	My doctor is caring and understands I like natural remedies and cures, but will make sure I am aware of all of my options in any condition and suggests what she feels is the best route for me. We have developed a relationship of trust and genuine care for each other. She always makes extra time for me during my appointments because she knows I like to talk and I feel that relationship helps foster trust so she doesn't rush me to a remedy to get me out of her office but cares about my well-being.
-1	The physicians ive had generally rush through the procedures, and care little for my thoughts. I have never had a severe condition but it would worry me if i ever did
-1	Since it's the doctor's job, and they are more knowledgeable in the field of health, I have to trust them, even if I think if their decision is a little questionable. I can ask them questions on why they recommend something, but they have more expertise in the field than me.
-1	Sometimes I feel the doctors are only going to do as much as they need to cover the basics. For instance, if a patient only have medicaid or medicare the doctors will not suggest better treatment options that are available because the health care doesn't cover it. This practice is done without regard to the patient being able to fund the treatment in another capacity. This same treatment is the opposite for those with private healthcare. 
1	While I have been lucky to have great doctors whom I trust, and I trust my current doctors, I would say that I do not necessarily trust doctors in general. This is because I understand that doctors are less likely to take women's reported symptoms seriously, medications that may be prescribed are tested much less thoroughly on women than on men, and especially in obstetrics women are not given important information to monitor their own health during/after childbirth which leads to the US having an incredibly high maternal death rate for a first-world country. If I were a man, I would trust medical practices a great deal more. 
-1	I do get the impression that the doctor is trying to get through his visit with me as fast as possible. I understand that they need to do this to make a living, and I know the realities of insurance reimbursement and the way they are paid. Still, it means that I am suspicious of my doctor's motives and I don't really fully trust them. I know they are looking out for their interests before they are necessarily looking out for mine.
-1	I trust my doctor because I feel he has no reason to deceive me. I give them good money to be told the truth and guided in the right direction regarding my health.
1	My doctor is very trustable because he takes his time with me and cares about me getting better when im ill. I have no reason to distrust him with all he does for me. Hes the best at what he does.
1	I think the doctor I have has made several diagnosis that have been correct about me over the years, so because of that I trust him quite a bit. Doctors do seem to minimize the time they see me in the office but I can forgive that since they are very busy.
-1	It's hard to keep cynical thoughts out of my mind. I can't help but see them as flawed and just figuring things out like everyone else. It's hard to know if I'm communicating clearly enough for them to totally understand everything anyway.
-1	I think that the amount of patients doctors are forced to see to be paid reasonably means they spend small periods of time with large numbers of patients. I am sure that given more time with each patient, along with adequate time to review medical tests and records, more nuances of medical conditions may be noticeable and it would be easier for doctors to prep for each appt with adequate resource material to provide the patient.
-1	I have had terrible medical experiences for the last twenty years and I finally have a great Dr who will spend hours with me if necessary and appears to actually care how I am doing. 
1	My family has been going to the same physician for over 50 years, starting with my grandfather. Our doctor has been reliable and up front for all that time. I have no reason not to trust his judgement.
-1	At the end of the day it is their job and duty to ensure that i get the help i pay for so i am generally rather trusting of them and their judgement
1	He has been in the healthcare profession for quite some time and is very knowledgeable. He is well respected in the community
1	My primary care physician takes the time to go through what has gone on since the last time I've seen them.  They go through all of my medications.  They do an exam and go over any and all symptoms I may be having. They thoroughly discuss any labwork that was completed and then discuss all options for changes.  I trust their opinion because they take time with me. 
-1	My insurance isn't great and I have to go to a very low cost doctor whom I don't have a lot of trust in, to be frank. She has often told me things that I outright knew were wrong (e.g.: continuing to tell me to take St. John's Wort after being prescribed Prozac, rinsing out a dog bite with hydrogen peroxide). It makes me wonder if the things she tells me that I DON'T know are wrong are correct.
1	Good references from other people concerning his technical ability, thoroughness, genuine interest in patients.  He's also embedded in a system with lots of other support services, and uses them thoughtfully.
-1	I do have trust in my PCP - as he is intelligent and qualified, but he runs a busy office and I often times feel as though he rushed through the process or appointment. 
-1	Most of the time, doctors do what is easy, or less expensive. Not caring about how miserable I may be. I have met very few doctors that understand that I have lived in my body my whole life, not them.
1	I've been to doctors in the past that I've questioned some of their decisions, but I'm very happy with the current doctor I see.  She is knowledgeable, well-educated and respects me as a patient.  She listens to my concerns and responds in an appropriate way.
-1	I have a good rapport with my personal physician. I feel this way because she not only takes the time to thoroughly discuss my health, but she also spends time with me discussing issues that are not always directly or indirectly for that matter, related to my health.
-1	For the most part, my Primary Care Physician actually listens to what I'm saying. Because I do experience anxiety, I've had previous doctors that brushed my symptoms aside as simply anxiety and not an actual problem. My PCP isn't like that for the most part. She has questioned if it was my anxiety but believed me when I told her I could tell the difference and that it wasn't. What I don't like about her is the way that she treats the med students. She literally told one in the room with me to not ask so many questions. That made me nervous because that's how people get killed is by not asking questions.
-1	I do not believe that doctors know much about a lot of problems that have not been discovered and wrongly diagnose people very often with something based on very little research or facts. I also believe they are sales men for pharma company more then they are doctors who want to help people.
-1	I don't have a primary care physician, but in general, doctors are open about a patient's health. Even when they are stern, it is because they want the patient to have the best outcome. There are few doctors who would deliberately mislead a patient. 
-1	One of the main reasons I trust my doctor is that he actually listens to me unlike some doctors.  He takes what I say in to consideration and knows that I am familiar with my body and that I usually am on par with what he is thinking.
-1	I trust my doctor because he always gives me all my options in detail and never tries to mislead me. Sometimes though he does seem to push options that are more convenient for him and the practice. 
-1	I feel that doctors often are overbooked and take the easy way out.  Itâs got to be a nightmare dealing with insurance companies.  Many just treat every patient the same.
1	I have only had two primary care physicians in my 30 years of life. I am very particular and will only stick with a physician I feel I can completely trust. My current doctor is very open minded and has never once shut down any of my concerns. He has never made me feel rushed in an exam room. He gives his patients his cell and home phone numbers in case we need anything. He is always there and available. He is extremely supportive of my choices and the way I want my healthcare to go, but isn't afraid to tell me I'm making the wrong choices and offer better ideas when needed.
1	I trust my doctor because he takes the time to listen to me. I never feel rushed and have to confidence to speak my mind. He also seems to care about how I am doing overall, not just medically. 
-1	I don't feel that my doctor actually takes the time to always understand what I am experiencing.  I feel that he thinks that since I meet the general criteria then I am in a category that I am not necessarily in.  My first experience with him I was a little overweight and had high blood pressure.  He said that if I don't loose weight by my next visit we need to discuss weight loss surgery.  Crazy.
-1	I don't feel like they take the time to get to know me. And what I would want or offer me all options or ask questions. 
-1	doctors and staff are motivated by pharma, insurance, and liability.  They are also overworked, often seeing several patients at once.  That puts my best interests at the bottom of the barrel.  I have had bad luck with doctors through most of my life-- bad advice, dismissive of my symptoms, etc.  I don't dislike my current doctor, but don't fully trust her either.  
-1	It is not so much that I distrust doctors. I just do not blindly trust them. I take what they have to say and go from there. I may have a differing opinion on what the best option is going forward. I also may agree with what they have to say and we are both on the same page. I think I ere on the side of caution. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been with him my entire adolescent and young adult life. I have fallen ill beyond a point where I could recover without assistance from a medical professional and when I went to my doctor for consultation, I felt like I was in knowledgable and caring hands. Furthermore, my parents have faith and put trust in my doctor and I know my parents want what is best for me and my own health, that is why I would trust my primary care physician even more. 
-1	I trust most doctors to do what's right, but I also believe that they've been taught to treat illnesses instead of trying to avoid being sick in the first place. So I believe there are tests done to people that might not be totally necessary in the first place. That's just what they're taught. 
-1	I think my doctor is very likely to want to prescribe a medication too early without looking deep enough into my condition. I think my doctor could gather more symptoms in order to make a more informed decision. 
1	I have a great doctor who is very understanding and takes time to dig deeper. My previous primary care doctor just wrote me prescriptions and sent me on my way without listening, which is how I went undiagnosed with a thyroid problem. Having a doctor who listened and took the time to figure things out why fighting my insurance makes me trust her a great deal. 
-1	I think it all comes down to certain situations on how much you get out of your doctor, if it's right before they're leaving they're going to rush and just say what's convenient even if it's not 100% accurate. If they've had a good weekend and i'm the first person than there's a good chance i'm going to receive everything I should get on any time.
1	I have been lucky in life.  I have not ever had any serious medical issues.  So maybe my faith in medicine hasn't really been tested yet.  But I tend to trust my doctor to give me the best care that she knows how.  I know that science and medicine are always coming up with new ideas, so not everyone can know everything.  all I as is the best care you know to provide. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because they are experienced and very caring. MY physician takes the time to explain all the possible procedures and how they will effect my outcome. My physician from day one has spent ample time with we talking and understanding my needs and concerns
-1	I don't think my doctor takes enough time with me, or patients in general, to really know what is best. I think that my doctor relies on drugs too quickly and too often as the solution to the problem.
-1	Doctors are people who can make mistakes. My issue is less that I distrust my primary care physician, but more that I do not trust him/her completely. No professional should be trusted completely, and patients need to have basic critical thinking skills when seeing a doctor. 
-1	I do not put complete trust in anyone but myself. I would like to believe them but odds are I will get a second opinion or verify what they told me myself.
-1	I don't think she is that great of a doctor. I wouldn't mind changing to another one if I could find one that's better.
1	My wife and some other family members have the same doctor as I do. All of us have good things to say about my doctor. She does a good job each time I go to see her at an appointment. The reason I didn't put strongly agree is because all doctors are't 100% perfect and that some of the decisions regarding medication are mine. There are a few prescriptions I am on that I am not the biggest fan of. 
-1	Most doctors care about their patients. Unfortunately, the system is set up so they probably cannot spend as much time with each patient as they would like. I think they do the best they can given the circumstances but I also believe in taking responsibility for my own health. I take everything with a grain of salt and often wonder if health professionals are not telling me everything for their own financial gain (i.e. pharma companies supplying incentives for pushing certain medications/treatments).
-1	"i have a difficult time in general trusting only one person with something serious, so i don't have ""complete"" trust in the doctors i see. i value their opinions and typically do what they think is best unless there's a good reason not to, but i wouldn't call it complete trust"
-1	I believe doctors often do not want to admit when they do not know something so they will bs and beat around the bush. This leads me to not trust them and be skeptical of future advice.
-1	I generally trust doctors in general. However, they get caught in a huge bureaucracy and regulations and fear of law suits when it comes to healthcare in general, it limits their options.
1	He will actually open up studies and show me where the information is coming from. He does not beat around the bushes. He gives me pros and cons for everything when it comes to symptoms or medications
-1	I do not know my primary care doctor that well. I see him 1-2 times per year. He is very smart and knows what he is talking about, but that's not how I build trust with people.
1	I trust my doctor because he is a professional. He always treats me with care and respect. I never feel like I'm getting bogus or insufficient information. He's also pretty good at remembering things I've told him in the past--personally, I mean. 
-1	It is not that I distrust them. I know that they have many patients, and that their attention cannot be 100 percent on me. It is my own responsibility to make sure that I am doing everything I can to keep myself healthy. They have a lot of patients, but I only have me.
-1	I trust my doctors in general, however sometimes it seems like it would be easy for them to just prescribe medications to treat ailments rather than getting down to the root cause of the problem.
1	I trust my PCP because he always explains in depth why he prescribes a drug or treatment. He takes the time to listen to my symptoms and does a thorough exam.
-1	I generally trust my doctor, but I feel like I see them only occasionally and not for that long, so although I trust their diagnoses and treatment recommendations, I also think I would seek out further information about it so that I could consider how much I think it is good.
-1	I believe that my primary care doctor is mostly interested in the money and as such is not completely honest when prescribing medications or diagnosing problems. sometimes I feel as though he is too busyt to explain in detail and gets frustrated if I ask questions. I pretty much think this is true of the medical profession as a whole and as such I am reluctant to trust any doctor. 
1	I guess I have only had one issue that involved a pap smear test going to the wrong lab and me being charged way too much (like $10 vs $500). Considering that was just human error, I have no real reason to distrust my doctor. But mistakes can happen, so I don't fully trust anything. 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I've had many doctors before him that I did not trust, so it's easy to see that my doctor is trustworthy in comparison. I can tell that my primary care doctor is caring and kind, and that he explains all my options. I trust him because he goes over everything in detail and will go over lab results with me line by line and ask if I have any questions. Before I leave for my visit he asks if I have any other questions or concerns I wanted to address, this shows me that he cares and is trustworthy. 
1	He has always been open and honest about everything and fully explains what is going on or what he is doing.  He will give me all my options and let me make a decision or give his opinion as to what is best but still let me decide. 
-1	I believe my doctor is fallible, just like any other humans. All doctors have difficult and stressful jobs, and will sometimes take the easy route of simply prescribing unnecessary medications with both short-term and long-term side effects instead of providing other options.
-1	I don't trust doctors in general because they are not there to truly help you but rather to sell you medicine and procedures which simply hide the problem and not fully address it which ultimately results in the worsening of my health. 
-1	 I feel I can trust them based on the general information , and listen to solutions where I know they are not just trying to take my money. Many times the use of fancy language and misdiagnosis lead me , and many other patience astray which is why I am neutral in that I trust most of their practice , but know they can have bad intentions and give wrong information.
-1	I generally try to trust doctors, unless I feel like I am being rushed through or not listened to.  I feel most doctors have keeping me healthy as their top priority.
-1	As I stated previously, I haven't had any serious conditions, but I have been to my doctor occassionally in the last few years.  Whenever I have seen her she has never seemed rushed or like she was trying to just move along to the next patient. I was able to talk very easily and at length.  Additionally, the illness or issue has always been resolved fairly quickly with the doctor's recommendations.
1	I have always had no issues or concerns with my doctor and believe that they have my best interest in mind and are honest with me.
-1	Doctors have received the proper training and certification to perform their job to the best of their abilities. I trust these qualifications enough to trust doctors, but just like every other professions there will be problems. I do not expect everything at a hospital to go right for doctors, but I expect them to treat patients with care.
-1	It always seems that doctors are rushed. I don't think that they always have patients best interest in mind. Paying more attention to the bottom line than well being of patients. 
1	I don't believe a poor doctor would remain in business for very long.  I regularly check reviews on doctors before I use them.
-1	"In my most recent visit, he dressed me down for not having had a mammogram or Pap smear in a few years...he was right. Time just slipped away from me. I was irritated that he wanted a blood test for my estrogen levels, but he gave me a good reason: he wanted to know whether I was getting the right dosage in my estradiol pills (prescribed by a different doctor). All in all, he seemed pretty straight forward and not into ""woo""."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I've known him since I was a child. He's been my doctor for my whole life and I trust him. He's made great decisions for me and has almost always been right in regard to my medical issues. We are very close and he is very intelligent and has a wonderful bed side manner.
-1	I distrust my doctor because they have to google the answers to my questions when I come in to see them with questions. I currently have Medi-Cal and the selection of doctors that accept Medi-Cal are limited. After I finish school and have health insurance, I would definitely do research to switch my primary care physician to someone I trust more. The doctors at the office have a cosmetic focus as well as primary care, so when I had asked for a referral to see a dermatologist, I was not given one. Though the doctor did not push me to get cosmetic treatment, I feel like referrals to dermatologists would hurt their business.
1	Initially I have complete trust in my doctors.  Some have lost trust.  Some have gained a lot.  I tend to trust the doctors with the most education.  Trust is very important to accurately give all the personal information required.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for serveral years and he explains any problems I have to me in detail.  He describes and goes over every decision made and we decide on treatment option together.  
-1	I don't have any reason not to trust my doctor. I will continue to trust her until she does something to earn my distrust. I would apply the same standard to any doctor.
-1	I've been seeing this PCP for the majority of my life so i trust her judgement on most medical decisions. Sometimes i feel as if though she has a lot on her plate and can't spend more than a few moments reviewing certain pieces of information about my medical history, but overall she touches base on all of my medical concerns. 
-1	A couple of times she had misdiagnose my illness. I went to a specialist after talking to my Primary care practician
1	I generally am in good health, but that's partly due to having some knowledge of nutrition as well as a working understanding of well-being. Accordingly, I can tell when a doctor is bullshitting me but I find that they generally don't.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor to an extent; he is fallible just like anyone else. I will do my own research after visiting with him, and if I don't agree with something, e.g., a medicine he recommends or a treatment protocol, I will tell him what I have found, why I don't want to take it, and let's try something else. Ultimately, I know my body best and I do my utmost to take care of myself.
-1	I do not have a PCP but I do see a dermatologist. I also used to work with this person so I have seen him give numerous patients medical advice including myself. I feel that after years of practice he is very knowledgeable about what he is doing and I trust the way he treats myself and others. I feel that the longer you are in practice the more knowledgeable you become. 
-1	I trust doctors mainly because I don't really have a reason not to. I have never been mislead by a doctor or have received any bad medical advice in the past. 
1	I trust doctors that take time to go over any questions I have in detail. They are not rushing out of the room to get to the next appointment. They see me as a human and not a dollar sign or bottom line.
1	My doctor is open and willing to have conversation about my concerns. She listens and then refers me for further study or specialist if she is not certain of the status or route to take.
-1	He is the new young doctor at the clinic I go to. Straight out of residency. A few times he has had to consult with the other doctor there. I take this as a good sign. I know he will never give a bad diagnosis or advice
-1	I recently started with a new primary doctor and I don't trust her.  She has not been very helpful and just wants to send me off to other specialists.  She's not really helping me.
1	I trust my doctor because he's been with me for quite a while and he's never brushed off any of my concerns.  While he talks to me like I'm a friend, when he needs to be, he's serious and blunt and makes sure that I understand what's going to happen.  The one time I needed surgery, his recommendation was wonderful.  He regularly checked up on me and made sure I was recovering nicely which definitely made me feel more like a friend rather than just a patient.  Considering that and the way he thoroughly explains things to me, I have complete trust in him.
1	I trust my doctor a lot. She spends a lot of time with me at my appointments and is never rushed. She listens and offers good advice when I bring up issues such as my living situation which might be affecting my health, like living with second hand smoke.
1	My primary care Doctor is great. She spends a lot of time with me and monitors my health very closely! She is really caring and gets really excited if I eat healthy and drop weight and get my BP down and my cholestral down. She is a nice person and if she is late she will apologise when she comes in unlike most Doctors!
1	Because i have been going to him for over 5 years and he has always been good to me he listen to me and he would never put me on anything that he wouldn't put his family on
-1	My doctor wants what is best for me and will prescribe the best course of action. He has a lot of experience doing what he does, so I trust his decision and authority over anything that I might think.
1	I trust him because I never feel rushed or pressured when I go in for a visit. The nurses seem to also care a lot and help where and when they can. My doctor also tries to make himself available outside of the office, which is really nice.
-1	"I think that doctors do care about their patients, but I think that the degree of sympathy strongly correlates to what time you show up in their day. I have found that many doctors don't like to seem wrong, so they will always go to the quickest solution first, and don't tend to really even consider other conditions unless you pry them with questions about relevant symptoms. My problem is mostly with treatment options. Doctors offices are often sponsored by various name brand drugs and that often sways the decision on which drugs to give as treatment. I also don't agree with the trend to do different screening procedures for different insurance plans. It seems that the better your insurance is, the more expensive and more prevalent the testing that is ""required"" becomes. "
-1	I think my doctor has my best interests at heart, even if she is very busy.  She always has a lot of patients but she has shown genuine care for me.  She takes the time to give me all the options for treatment and explains them.
-1	I feel neutral about them because sometimes I feel like they are just telling me the most common solution to my problem instead of thinking outside the box.  Sometimes I feel like they make excuses so they don't have to really think in depth about what could be wrong with me.  
-1	The doctors office i go to is always so busy. I normally have to wait a very long time for appointment. Then when the doctor sees me now it does not last for more than 20 minutes. They are always telling me to leave and that there is nothing I can do.
-1	I think it is probably inefficient for a doctor to be thorough, especially if the best course of action for me might be unconventional. 
1	My doctor is an excellent communicator, a good listener and expresses his opinions with confidence.  He is well-trained, experienced and view him as a trusted friend. I trust him and confide in him.
1	Had my doc for ten years now.  In a small town with limited healthcare I was nervous, but first time I met the guy, I knew he was ok. Has all the latest do dads to measure the blood pressure and all.  Always knows whats best.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I feel there are things besides good medical practice which afffect the decision making of my doctor. When it comes to treatments, I feel my doctor is influenced by the pharmaceutical industry either directly (through an active relationship) or indirectly (through the funding that is given by those companies to research which then dictates what treatments are available or not).
-1	My doctor has been a family friend for years and is aware of my needs. My doctor treats me like a member of family and makes sure that someone has the information I need before I leave in case I forget what needs to be done at a later date or later on in the day. 
1	My doctor is very open and honest. She just not speak down to me or just give me orders. She communicates with me in a dialogue, listening to my concerns and opinions. She shows real interest, offers advice, and listens. She does not lecture but works with me as a teammate to take care of my health.
1	He seems to know what he is talking about and explains things quite well, so i trust what he tells me.  So far I have no reason not to.
-1	"I know that my doctor is at the mercy of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. He doesn't have time to invest in talking to me, he has to electronically chart my case in detail to kickstart the billing process, and he often does that in front of me. His waiting room has pens, clocks, and other knickknacks branded to pharmaceuticals, and his exam room has branded ""informational"" posters, all of which are badges of bias. "
1	Though I think my doctor may make some choices that are easier for him, I know he is a well respected and good doctor. He is published many times so I generally trust what he has to say and am confident in his choices and actions.
1	My primary care physician really listens to what I say. She remembers things about me from appointment to appointment. I really feel she wants me to be healthy and happy. 
1	My primary physician has always taken good care of me. There has never been a moment where I even questioned him because he does his job diligently. I always leave his presence feeling better whether its because I've got medicine or a greater state of mind about my current situation. He has never given me a chance to doubt his capabilities. 
-1	The reasons why I do not trust my primary care physician is that I have the impression that they mostly care about safeguarding their liability instead of being concerned about the patient's medical needs
1	I have been seeing my doctor for 15 years. He sends me to specialist when my care is outside of his realm of primary care and so far he has sent me to doctors that have been pretty good with my specialties. There was a time that I did not have insurance and my doctor did his best to do what he could that would help without insurance.
-1	My primary case physician spends a lot of time with me and any issues I have are probably due to my inability to communicate my issues to him effectively.
-1	My primary care doctor is a psychiatrist, and she does a good job of talking about both medical and non-medical treatments. She's good about explaining side effects and talking about realistic outcomes of treatment, and she knows it's important for me to feel like I'm not being pushed into making decisions.
-1	I suffered from migraines for years, my doctors always said to just stay away from my triggers. They never worked with me to reduce or relieve them. 
1	When I go see my primary physician it seem that he is always looking out for me . When I ask question he effectively answers them and provides many solutions to the problem I go in for.  
-1	Anymore, I think time is a limiting factor in how effective a provider is. If given more time to spend with patients, I would be much more willing to have total trust. 
-1	I trust my doctor and his decisions about what is right for me, but overall I am know what is best for me and I do not trust many medications.
-1	I generally think that doctors are good people who go into medicine to try to help people. I also believe that like any profession, there are nuances that average people do not understand or care to, and I can not completely trust an individual who has personal incentive to provide you care that is not necessarily ideal for you. As long as pharmaceuticals are as big of an industry as they are I cannot completely trust doctors. 
1	I have a really good relationship with my primary care physician.  I've been seeing the same primary care physician for over 7 years now.  He's helped me through issues that I knew I had (anxiety/depression) and also issues I didn't know I had (possible melanoma).  I have gotten to know some about his background as well, and given what I know, I trust him implicitly. 
1	I have seen the same doctor for years who I have an extremely close relationship with.  He has been honest with me whether it has been a negative or positive thing that we are speaking about.  After him giving me extra time and going out of his way for me on separate occasions, he has more than proved himself as genuine.
-1	For the most part I can trust my primary care physician, but I also like to do my own research just to be on the safe side. I trust him because he has helped me when I was sick in the past. 
1	I trust  my primary care physician because I have seen her for years and she is actively involved while I'm at my appointments. If I have a question she takes her time to find out the answer if its not something she can immediately answer and gets back to me about it. She also spent more time training for her profession than me. 
-1	It is my opinion that a lot of doctors are just out for the money and they want to rush you out and get the next patient in.  I do not think all doctors are like that but I do think that when someone is looking for a blocked or to choose they should really make sure they feel comfortable that they're getting treated properly.   Also if you have something majorly wrong with you I believe that a second or even a 3rd opinion is a good idea.   I believe it's called a practice because no doctors perfect and every doctor it continuously learning.  When experience I recently had is I was sent to the emergency room with a stomach related problem the doctors was full and I got sent to the heart floor for an overnight visit.   They gave me an EKG even though I was not there for my heart in charge me anyways even though I disputed it.   I am they're young and have a very healthy heart there was no reason for that.
-1	I have trust in doctors because i feel that are trained very well and see things everyday and know about them.  I feel my doctor is paid accordingly and should trust my doctor as she would know best and whats best for me regarding my health. My doctor is usually a no nonsense kind of doctor and is very direct which is what i prefer so i know exactly where i stand.  
-1	I some times dont trust doctors as they have become commercial now a days and sometimes they are selfish about their own growth financially irrespective of the patient's health. sometimes i do trust my doctor's decision but sometimes m doubtfull but dunno why but no doctor is more careful about my medical needs than his own.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because they seem fairly personable.  They care about me as a person, and I have known them for almost 20 years. 
1	I have gone to the same physician for all of my adult life now; my mom is his nurse, so I'm always able to get in and out quickly, and believe that he strives to offer me the best care possible.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes her time in explaining things to me and giving me advice. She is NEVER in a rush, even though there are probably other patients waiting for her. She never hesitates to tell me to call her or her office -- or through the patient portal -- with any questions or concerns that I might have. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done anything which has lost my trust. There have been several instances where he knew is capabilities and referred me to a different doctor who have the knowledge and skill necessary to help me in my time of need. When I visit with him his head isn't in a pad or notebook so I do not feel like I am just another checklist in his big book of clients. He is very personal and takes the time to actually talk to me and get to know my family which is nice. I have also been going to him for some time so I have built a good report with him.
1	he always answers all of my questions, explaining things in a way that i as a non-medical person, can comprehend.
-1	My primary care physician is not very thorough. He also doesn't take my concerns that serious. It also seems as though he is always rushed when I go in for an appointment. 
1	I've been in and out of doctor's office since I was a teenager to help with my depression/anxiety issues. With the exception of a few, all have been genuine people who have shown a complete and utter dedication to helping me be my best physically and mentally.
-1	I suppose there are numerous reasons why I don't trust doctors, but the biggest reason for me is that I feel most get into the profession because they want to make a lot of money. The concern for them isn't treating sickness out of the good of their heart, they simply desire to make a lot of money, even if they sacrifice their time/well being for it. It's about them being well off, not me. For me, this is an icky feeling and I have trouble getting over it. I have met doctors whom I have come to trust, but that takes time and they have to prove exceptional to get over that greed-hurdle I've imposed on them.
-1	I feel that doctors are very educated and trained individuals who opinions should be taken into consideration. For serious medical conditions, I believe in obtaining second opinions. I am in general weary of taking prescribed medication.
-1	Before my doctor's office was so busy it was hard to get an appointment and it was never the same doctor. I have a new doctor now and he seems more detailed but I felt rushed again. 
1	My doctor has treated me well. My only complaint is that he is sometimes in a rush and I can sense he doesn't have more than a few minutes to speak with me.
1	I have had the same primary doctor for at least a decade. He is a primary care physician, and he has never done me wrong. He is flexible enough to let me try new drugs when they are helpful in being productive in my life.
-1	I distrust my because we would rather save money and resources. rather than try and help my illness and or bodily dysfunction.
-1	Doctors are highly educated but may not have all the information regarding every disease, particularly chronic illnesses and it is always better to do your own research as long as it is done properly and well.
1	I have an excellent PA who has consistently steered me in the right direction with the treatment of my health and I believe he listens and understands my concerns.
1	My primary care physician has only ever shown me they are thorough.  They do not make me feel rushed and always provide a satisfactory answer and checkup before they move on.
-1	I think i trust the physicians to do their job to the best of their ability. Sometimes, i think that there are areas that are too specialized and then i seek out more information. 
1	I have never had an experience with my current primary care physician that would make me question my trust in them.  They have always been helpful, receptive and caring.
-1	I believe physicians or primary care go to school to have the up most education in understanding another human. Sometimes you know your self too much to want to hear what a physician has to say. But its always great to hear the physician out because that its there job to do so. They are there to help the public and anyone in need.
-1	My primary care physician tends to present options to me and suggest one of the options based on what he knows about me, such as waiting to have surgery performed for something that is not life threatening but may cause more issues in the future than what it does now. He also listens to my concerns and addresses them in an understanding way.
1	In my family we have the habit of always seeing the same doctor and socializing with him, because of that, the trust we have for him and, apart from that, he has proven to be a reliable person over the years.
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE I HAVE GONE TO HIM FOR MANY YEARS.  I CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND HE ALWAYS EXPLAINS THING ADN TAKES GOOD CARE OF ME.
-1	I think they have a good knowledge of medical things. Sometimes they might do what is safer than more effective
-1	I usually trust doctors to provide the best care possible for me or my family.  As long as frequent checkups and follow-ups occur, doctors can closely monitor a patient's health and provide the appropriate treatments for any conditions they may have.  As long as a doctor keeps a good relationship with me and makes me feel comfortable I trust in them to have good intentions for my health.
1	I trust my doctor because we have built up a solid report, where she listens to and respects my feelings and does not trivialize them.
-1	In general, I trust what she tells me.  However, she is a general practitioner and I've learned that when I consult with specialists I often get more options and more information.  Therefore, I don't always think what my GP tells me is all I need to know.
-1	I have an equal amount of trust as I do distrust with my doctor, given that I know him and my mother talk, and that I distrust her entirely with my health causes an issue. I believe that what I say to him can impact my home life, because it gets back to my mother. In general, i suppose I trust doctors, as long as they're not corrupt or anything. When I will be tasked with finding my own doctor, I will look long and hard for someone I believe to be trustworthy
-1	Sometimes I feel that my physician has a lot going on and not a lot of attention going toward me. I understand that they are overworked but I do feel that I will need to take charge of my own health if I feel that they do not completely understand me. I will take what they say strongly into consideration but if it does not seem to fit me, I believe that I know myself better than they do.
-1	I trust them because they have taken some health issues (depression, anxiety) more seriously than other doctors I have seen. I sometimes feel rushed though, so I am unsure if I always receive the complete truth or all my options. Overall I feel I have a good relationship with them and accept their opinions. 
1	Generally, I feel they have little reason to be dishonest or disingenuous, compared to the large incentive they have to be truthful and helpful.
1	I was taught to trust doctors and those in authority.  Even though I may have questions regarding what they are prescribing or telling me what to do, I still do have some skepticism.  Doctors often work with pharmaceutical companies and I wonder if the drugs they suggest are actually good for me or good for their profession and their bottom line (AKA money).  
-1	It's not more of a trust or distrust, it is more of a time thing. I feel like doctors, including my own, need to be able to spend more than 3-5 minutes with a patient. Yes, I know I have a cough and sneezing, so my asthma is acting up. Don't just throw a new inhaler on me. Give me some options and other things I can do at home. I want to know the options I have for medications too. So I feel that adds a little mistrust, but I still feel like he is a good physician. I hope that makes sense. 
1	I think that most doctors try their best to give me the best treatment and offer good advice on what i need to do or what needs to be done.
-1	"I had an experience where I thought all possible testing was done on an annual basis, and that I had requested and approved.  I later found that that was not the case and I was positive for something that they don't test for ""unless you have symptoms"", even though it was consistently marked as something I wanted to be tested for annually.  Since then I have had no issues, but that was a serious misstep in communication."
-1	I have more trust in doctors than I distrust them but there are always exceptions. Mostly it comes down to the situation because there are times when I can tell that they are hard pressed for time due to having a lot of patients. If it is a serious medical issue I would also want a second or third opinion regardless of the trust I have in my doctor.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have never given me a reason not to. I have been seeing the same primary care physician for about six years now and they always address all the questions I have and spend a fair amount of time with me. I have always felt well taken care of.
1	I trust my doctor because she has always listened to my issues and questions.  She always gets back to me with an answer if I happen to email or call her.  I have always felt safe and well taken care of and I never worry about her not getting back to me.  She really cares about me and my well-being and it shows in her interactions with me.
-1	I feel doctors are trustworthy in the fact that too many people are sue happy. So if the doctor does something that people can sue and get easy money they will. So in my opinion doctors need to be careful and be trusting all at the same time
-1	I trust  my doctor in their opinion Until I donât recently were sent to separate specialist with a special said what are you doing here and they couldnât understand why the doctors on is there because there wasnât a problem and that cost $600 over heâs help me and a lot of other ways but thatâs a lot though
-1	my previous experience with my primary care physician gave me the impression that he was more interested in me as a cash cow than as a patient.
-1	I do have a lot of trust in my physician as he has always been there for me, he tries very hard to get me n to see him in case of an emergency, and he has even called me at home to check on me, after I have seen him.
-1	Although I tend to trust my doctor, I am also a little bit skeptical.  Having worked with many different doctors I know there are many that think they know everything or are influenced by pharmaceutical companies and won't listen to the patient's ideas or won't take the patient seriously because they're the doctor and know better.  
-1	"It seems in the last 2 years that my primary doctors practice has quadrupled in the size of patients, what use to be a 20 min wait is now sometimes 1.5HOURS, they seem to put 6 people in 1 time slot - this makes your time with the doctor feel rushed, and then you forget to tell them some of your symptoms which are important. This makes for mistakes in every angle - diagnoses, blood work etc, it is not that I fully dont trust my actual doctor, its the craziness of the practice and the feeling you are on a ""food line"" and they are not really totally focused on 1 patient - so every one loses in the long run - I have had nurses so confused that they were trying to give me a flu shot 2x because of the amount of people in the waiting room and at the nurses lab."
-1	I feel that my primary doctor is very trustworthy but is quick in the amount of time he allots to my visits. I would like a doctor to spend all necessary amount of time with me to explain everything and answer all of my questions.
-1	My physician is very nice and relaxed, he's open to talk and laugh. He is very thorough, even to the point that he wants to schedule so many tests that I'm the one who says no. My only problem is there is only limited time with him, instead there are 4 other assistants or nurses who come before and after him for different purposes and they all come and go quickly
1	I trust my primary care doctor because I have been going to her for years. She is a very caring and understanding physician. She listens to your needs and helps you find a solution to your problems that makes you comfortable. She doesnât make you feel pressured nor incompetent when you donât understand the health terminology. She breaks things down so you can understand and she makes sure she available if you have any questions or concerns. My physician takes pride in what she does and itâs transmitted through her having our best interest at heart.
1	I believe my doctor is talented and capable.  I place a large amount of faith in my doctor and I feel that it is rewarded often. 
1	I trust my physician because they always ask whether I am doing okay or whether a certain medication is working for me. They want to make sure that I am in good health every time that I go to the doctors office for a visit. 
-1	I distrust doctors. I have vertigo that is bothering me a lot, so I went to my primary care doctor who did not help me much other than giving me pills to see if they were effective. It was not effective at all. Therefore, He referred me to another specialist doctor in ears, throat and nose. That doctor did not do anything to help me other than trying to deceive me into buying one of the non-prescription medicines which I could get at a lower price at a local Walgreen. I feel so hopeless. All I wanted was to heal my vertigo. I still have it now, but I don't trust any doctors anymore.
-1	I trust my doctor to do her job. To diagnose and treat. Doctors have gone to countless lectures and read numerous medical books and journals. They know much more about the human body and how it works than I do. With that being said, Doctors are still people and they do make mistakes but I trust them a lot more than Iâd trust a medically uneducated person to treat me.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she has known me since I was baby. She makes sure that I know what is going with my body at all times but she also tells it how it is.
-1	I trust most doctors because I do not believe they have ulterior motives. I know a lot of people think that the medical field is a sham, and doctors are only interesting in making a buck off sick people, but I genuinely believe that most doctors are good, honest, hard working people. If we did not have trustworthy doctors, there would be a lot more issues in the world than there currently are. There are also a lot of things in place to keep doctors ethical. It is a huge part of the profession. I doubt people who spend years of their life competing to be the best have any desire to be untrustworthy or scam people. 
-1	"I do trust medical professional to do the right thing or at least provide the correct treatment to their patients, however, I feel that it is very easy in this day and age for a doctor to overlook things (or not want to look into issues further because they are ""sure"" that's not what it is) I also think that doctors tend to over diagnose and test for things they don't necessarily need to in order to receive more money from the insurance companies."
-1	The short reason why I will not blindly trust a doctor is that they aren't infallible, and I've been on the receiving end of a bad doctors misdiagnoses and paid the price for it. So yah, not gonna trust anything blindly. 
1	I'm trust in my doctor because I know him since I'm a child and every time that he told me something is right he is someone with sense of kind and he is helpful and he care about his patience, He can make mistake like everyone because is human but I trust completely in him.
-1	"I don't completely distrust my primary care physician as much as I think he just doesn't care.  He seems pretty apathetic and uninterested in what's going on with me.  I don't think he realizes that I do take my health seriously most of the time and so I am going to do things that most people won't do to take charge of my health.  Where most people want a magic pill, I am willing to make changes in my lifestyle.  I don't think my doctor necessarily cares.  He just wants to prescribe a pill because it's the quickest easiest way to ""fix"" the problem."
1	I trust them because they are supposed to be the experts.  If i go to a doctor and i feel like their diagnosis isn't right, I will go get another opinion.  I trust them until they give me a reason not to.
-1	I'm not sure I trust him because he's a psychiatrists I've been seeing for 5 years.  I'm going downhill and he doens't seem concerned.  he's told me to look on the internet for advice that he should be giving.
1	My Doctor has not given me a reason not to trust them. When I go into the office I feel like I am always well cared for and that my doctor genuinely cares about my health. 
-1	He is more interested in turnover than quality care. He wants to get you in and out. He presumed you're an idiot.
-1	"I feel that they always say ""no, that symptom is not because of _____"" or just send me away with some blow-off treatment for my symptom. I am very aware of changes in my body and sensitive to them. He might know medicine way better than I do, but I know my body way better than he does. "
1	I have a NP who is under the license of a PCP. I love her! She is more thorough and caring than any other physician I have seen (other than my best friend, who is a nephrologist) in many, many years. The thing I like most about her is she really listens to my, my needs and wants, and I can trust her with anything.
1	They seem very educated and experienced. They have also worked with a variety of patients who have had complications, so they are qualified to make decisions. If I ask them a question regarding something I am hesitant about, they will give an educated response as to why they are doing what they're doing.
-1	It's great to have a personal doctor and it was could be the way u can save your life.An they care about u more
1	I trust doctors to help patients make the decisions. I believe that most doctors care about the well being of their patients. I believe that very few doctors are in the profession for themselves. 
1	My doctor takes her time, appears to listen, and seems compassionate. She provides her advise and encourages me to consider additional options that could help me be healthier. 
-1	I don't see the PCP too often and when I do its for a limited time. I don't think the PCP totally knows whats going on with my case because they have to work and think quickly and each patient in unique and treatment should be individualized. I feel like I'm just another patient. Plus I find it hard to believe the PCP knows everything about every case they see. They could be missing something vital. 
-1	Most of my more recent physicians have told me about treatments that they preferred, and completely neglected to tell me about other types of treatments that would be better, cheaper, and used newer techniques. They were an older doctor, and worked for a free clinic so I suspect they weren't keeping up with newer techniques (in their defense, they do come out at a blistering pace) and instead defaulted to an older, less effective series of treatments. This has happened a fair amount to me, and has led me to doing my own research and getting a second opinion.
1	My primary care physician is the only physician that I've had so far that hasn't made me feel bad about my body or my health decisions. She works with me to come up with the best plan and answers any questions I have about my treatment. 
1	She has been truthful the whole time I have been seeing her. I don't see her being untruthful now. She is a great person who is concerned about my well being.
-1	I distrust my doctor because he is always in a hurry when I see him. I feel like nothing but a number to him during most visits. 
-1	For me personally, I spent several years with an diagnosed problem, despite how often I was going to see my doctor about the problem.  Being that this problem was causing incredible pain, I am a bit distrustful of both my doctor and doctors in general.  I do not blame my doctor for missing it, but I do blame them for not even suggesting that my problem could have even been the cause.
1	I trust him because of the history i have with him, between having a baby and him understanding my health goals, it helps to have someone who knows your body and the required things it needs to feel better or well.
1	I trust doctors because they have the training and education and I do not. They understand what is happening to body and know what the best treatment will be. 
-1	Well in general, doctors sometimes listen to you and sometimes have their own agenda. I had a doctor once that knew I was allergic to codeine, so kept giving me 'alternatives' that I was also allergic to, even if I told him, yes, it says if you are allergic to codeine to not take this other one. 
1	I have no reason not to trust my doctor.  So far, she has always been thorough and helpful with any problem I am experiencing.
1	I've been to a lot of other Dr's who seem to ignore the issues I'm having and just focus on my weight. My current Dr does not do that, although we are working on getting my weight down it's not her solo focus.
1	Every time I have had a problem and my doctor has given me a solution, the solution has been beneficial to me personally and my health. I have been seeing my doctor for over five years now and have not yet had any experience that would lead me to believe anything different. He will tell me what I can do to improve myself more  such as losing weight or referring me to see a dermatologist if I am having skin problems. He will not tell me something about my health if he is not 100% certain and I appreciate that. 
1	While I was in the Army, I had no trust in my medical professionals. Now that I am a civilian, my doctors seem to actively listen and care about solving any issues that arise. 
-1	I have had issues with doctors prescribing medication that has harmed me while pregnant.  I have a son who has hearing loss due to a medication provided to me while I was pregnant.  I later found out it was not approved for pregnant women.  I also suffered a miscarriage after taking some medication prescribed for a virus from a doctor.  I can't say that it was caused by the medication or the virus, but looking back, I still don't trust that the medication was safe.
1	In general, I trust my doctor to take into consideration my wellbeing when and guide me in the right direction but at the same time I have reservations about whether they are giving me ALL the possible options.
-1	I don't trust or not trust my doctor, I just feel like they always point my symptoms at something that it's not. And I also worked in a doctor's office, so it made me not trust doctors as much as I would like to.
-1	I believe that my doctor is honest and trustworthy, but with all of the resources out there on the internet to research your health symptoms, it is hard for me to put complete trust in my doctor. I have also heard so many stories of people being misdiagnosed and the results were almost catastrophic! I have always been told to trust my instincts if I think that something is not right. That makes me so nervous to just accept what doctors tell me. I also ask for extra testing or information to double, even triple check what my doctor is telling me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because the few times I have been when I had a problem they were able to diagnose me correctly and do the right thing to get me better again.  
-1	In general regards to doctors as a whole, I feel that they are very rushed and dishonest. They do not take the time to answer all my questions and make sure I feel comfortable or am fully informed about any decisions being made.
1	I have learned to be very selective in choosing who I work with as a health care provider. If I find myself in a situation where I don't believe the provider is communicating on my level, or if they raise their voice or are clearly not concerned about my quality of life, I will cease to be their patient as soon as possible and find other practitioners. I also, have, on occasion, written letters of complaint to practitioners. The physician I currently am seeing is someone I've had a relationship with all my life, and from her way of communicating, I can see that she has good judgement.
-1	Its important to me to have a good relationship and a strong degree of trust with a chosen physician.  I'm relying on the physician to take good care of me and use good judgment.  They do the best they can I'm sure.  The patient too, has an active role in the relationship so try to do my best as well.
1	Same MD I've been seeing for 20 years, I feel she's very open & honest about everything.  She always offers a few different treatment options, and tells me why or why not she would recommend something.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have family members the use the same one and have had good experiences. He follows up on my health with phone calls and long conversations.
-1	I generally distrust doctors because they seem prone to prescribing drugs to put a Band-Aid on a problem rather than fix the problem itself.  I would be far more trusting if I found a doctor that was willing to help me fix the issue.
1	Because I've been seeing him for years now and he's a very honest doctor who treats you more like a friend he truly cares about rather than just another patient. He sincerely cares about me, my health and my needs and does all he can to help make me feel calm and safe and also optimistic about whatever health issue I'm facing. I've had zero issues with him over the years and despite being terrified of going to the doctor and hopsitals, I still have trust in him because he's never done me wrong. He looks out for my best interests and is one of the best, in my opinion. 
1	I trust my doctor, but I'm also interested in doing my own research, asking questions, and ensuring that I understand the reasoning behind the choices made.
-1	I would like to say I trust doctors but I seldom see one.  I do have medical appointments but I seldom see a full-fledged doctor.  I dislike having my rare times in medical offices be with a nurse practitioner, etc.
-1	My doctor does not seem to give as much effort into examination of me.  They mainly just ask a few questions and then take a quick look.  I feel that therapists would be much more helpful.
1	I trust my doctor because I have no reason not to and she is competent. Again, I have had only routine visits, nothing serious, so I don't have a lot to base it on.
-1	I sometimes get the impression from my doctor that they do want to do anything too risky, and often times medical conditions go untreated. For example, when getting colds, the doctor might just suggest that I wash my hands more frequently. That may be effective, but I could find that out by searching the internet, or even by thinking. I dislike paying medical bills for these types of consultations.
1	I feel like I get an adequate amount of feedback and explanation for their decision making to understand their thought process leading to the medical decision.
-1	I feel like sometimes my physician takes the extreme treatment option first, as in, wanting to do surgery immediately, versus taking a less invasive option first and seeing if it works. I often feel like my physician has one foot out the door because there are too many other patients waiting to be seen. I would rather weigh all of my options and start with the lest invasive option, and move further up the scale if it is needed.
-1	I feel that most doctors become doctors in order to do good and help people, however a few can let greed and selfishness get in the way of their original goals. I have been fortunate to have mostly positive interactions with my medical professionals throughout my life. 
-1	My doctor always tells it like it is and is completely trustworthy and down to earth. She knows that money is an issue and tries to make things as easy on me as possible
-1	I actually recently switched physicians to a PA. The town doctor the PA works for I do not trust at all because he is an jerk but on my form I have the PA as my primary and I trust him completely. He is a friend of the family and has been working in my town for decades. He is dedicated to what he does and very kind. Prior to my recent switch I had a pediatrician who was wonderful growing up and always steered me and my parents in the right direction. I wish I could have stayed with him but unfortunately pediatricians obviously only work with kids.  
1	I trust my primary physician because I've known him for many years. It is more of a built up trust that we have.
1	I have known my primary care physician for years. Every time I go there, I walk away positive and confident about my sickness and know that she will do what she can to help me get better. She is very thorough and has a lot of information to give and is patient with me. 
1	The practice of doctors is efficient.  They listen to my concerns, address them immediately, and strive to anticipate normal concerns and cover them.  They take an active interest in my overall health, not just in the complaint presented at appointments.  They are holistic in their care, and every doctor in the practice is comfortable with my chart and my needs.  They are all capable of helping and caring.
1	My doctor is around the same age as me. She is very aware that weight loss is important but it's not as simple as just losing some pounds. She has never pushed any shots or drugs on me if I'm not interested.
-1	My husband is in the Air Force so I have to see the military doctor on base.  Sometimes I feel rushed when I come in for an appointment and don't really get my needs met.  Sometimes I have a couple of problems but them only want to talk about one and that can be frustrating because I can't keep taking time off work to come in for everything.  There have been a few times where I've come in for a problem, one time in particular for an ear ache, and the treatment my doctor prescribed didn't work at all.  Instead of just referring me to a specialist they made me come in for another visit.  In the end, I'm still dealing with this ear problem that comes and goes.
1	I trust primary care physicians because in general, they have extensive training and tend to see many patients over the course of a short time span. They are typically knowledge and willing to refer me to specialist if a condition is out of their scope of expertise. I would not trust a primary care physician who is overworked or tired because I would think their judgement would be affected. 
1	I made sure to get friends opinions and also to do online research when choosing my doctor. She has an amazing bedside manner and makes me feel at ease. She does not over react and also does not under react.  I think there are some doctors that can come across as condescending and she is not like that at all.  It takes a special doctor to be able to answer your questions without making you feel like stupid!
-1	I trust my physician in general medical information, such as if I have the flu or strep throat or something like that. But if it was a serious medical diagnosis I would probably want to get a second opinion to make sure that they were onto something.
1	I feel my Dr. always listens to me and seems very caring. She always takes her time and is not in a hurry to get to the next patent. She explains everything more then once and always ask me if I have any questions and if I do when I get home to call or email her. 
-1	I don't have a PCP, so I'm just going based on random visits I have. Doctors seem rushed and unwilling to challenge anything other than their first assessment. 
-1	I distrust him because he just wants to hand out pills instead of getting to the root cause of the problem. He has been treating me for migraines for years and years and it turns out it wasn't even migraines. It was tension headaches. So he just wanted to switch me to a different medication instead of offering massage with the physical therapist (which is covered by the insurance).  I had to make a huge scene to get him to let me go to physical therapy over just trying to medicate the pain away. He's so focused on getting through his appointments in his allotted 15 minute slots that it keeps him from giving an honest look into the best solution for each patient individually. Some patients may be perfectly content with popping pills, but I'm not. He should have said here are the options available, which do you prefer?  But that doesn't happen with this doctor at all. 
-1	I feel like doctors are fallible.  Doctors are just people with extensive training and the body is such a difficult and complex machine.  I don't blame my doctors for not being accurate 100% of the time, but I think that it helps to keep an open mind and trust what my body is telling me. 
-1	I have some trust in my primary care doctor, but don't have 100% faith in him when dealing with other than really basic care issues. On the other hand, he is more than happy to refer his patients to specialists. It is almost like he is aware of his own limitations.
-1	I believe they do a good job, are a decent person and a good doctor. However I would still never put my trust completely fully in them, not without them earning my full trust in some way.
-1	I trust my doctor because they have gone to school for a very long time to study medicine. I feel they would not have been given a license if they were not competent enough to provide medical services. I believe most doctors generally want to help people. Even though some doctors are just in their field to make a lot of money. I trust my doctors if they have been practicing for a very long time because this would mean that they have experience. I also go by my gut feelings or intuition about people's character and trustworthiness in general.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician, but base my answers on the experiences I have had with various medical professionals. I have had some negative experiences with medical professionals where I feel they did not give me any valuable advice or services, but I was stuck with a large bill. One example was an experience where I went to a doctor for a birth control prescription. I was told I could not be prescribed the medicine without having my blood drawn, something I have never heard before. A nurse attempted to draw my blood unsuccessfully before asking that I visit a phlebotomist. I got stuck with a bill for an unsuccessful appointment, which generally is covered under my insurance as preventative care. Instead of going to the phlebotomist, I went to another doctor and got what I needed, all included by my insurance.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I believe in their expertise, years of training, and experience in the field. I do not consider myself a medical expert so believe it is in my best interest to defer recommendations to a professional who can offer informed guidance. 
1	I TRUST MY DOCTOR HE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR US FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS ALWAYS LED US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THOROUGH AND EXCELLENT MEDICAL CARE
-1	My Doctor is first off human and fallible. Second, he has repeatedly failed to listen to me and my symptoms when I have described conditions, only to discover that I indeed had the condition which I claimed. He also has a tendency to talk over me and has no real regard for my health, only placating my symptoms and referring me to specialists.
-1	I trust that they have more knowledge about medical issues than I have. That being said, I don't very often put 100% faith in anybody's opinion. I'll do my own research even if it's minimal, and if I'm really uncertain a second opinion is always nice.
-1	He usually explains the situation to me, asks my opinion when choosing a treatment. This way, he earned my trust
1	Well, These doctors have been to school for this. I like to walk into a clinic thinking that I will be in good hands and that the doctors know what they are doing.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician and I do not trust regular doctors in general. Honestly, it depends on the person. If I have a gut instinct that the doctor doesn't really care then I will not trust them and if my gut tells me that the doctor is compassionate and really cares about the job I will trust them. 
-1	physicians tend to look out for themselves and only provide medical advice/prescriptions based on what pharmaceutical company is paying them the most. They are overworked and don't spend enough time with their patients. 
1	My doctor is very knowledgeable and helpful. She explains everything that i need to know about my lab work and my exams. I feel that I can talk to her and she listens.
1	She is straight forward with me and lets me know about the options that I have. She doesn't sugar coat things and doesn't pressure me in to decisions that are unnecessary. I feel that she actually cares about my health. 
-1	I have a long-standing relationship with her and she has been right about diagnosis and treatment the vast majority of the time. During times where I've had complications, she's made herself available to me and has been flexible.
1	Doctors are highly trained professionals. They know what the best course of action for your conditions are better than you do. I think you should just trust and be honest with them if they have not given you a reason to do otherwise.
1	I have found them to be educated, compassionate, trluly concerned, and have my best interests at heart. They take the time to answer my questions and allay my concerns.
1	She spends an ample amount of time with me during my visits and makes sure to answer all of my questions. She also goes over every part of my visit and blood work in detail. She also follows up with any questions over the phone. 
-1	I haven't been with my primary care doctor for very long, so while I don't have a reason to distrust him, I haven't built up enough of a strong relationship yet.
1	I mainly trust him because he is a smart person who is detail oriented and when he explains something to me it makes sense to me. I have had doctors who tried to shoot me a line of bull to manipulate me which may seem good to them but if it does not make sense I can't believe anything they say.
-1	I have a good endocrinologist that I trust with medical issues; however, when it comes to diet recommendations he does not have accurate info.  I listen to my body and know that I must eat a ketogenic diet which my doctor does not agree with.
-1	I mean, overall I have trust.  That doesn't mean I wouldn't look for a second opinion on something life changing.  I always felt that most all Dr's know more then I do about these things.  I don't like it when they seem more interested in pushing a particular pill my way to mask rather then to look for ways to fix any certain condition.
-1	he is under a lot of pressure to see a lot of patients. he is always in a hurry and the medical record he refers to doesn't always seem complete for me, like what was covered in the last appointment. 
-1	"I sometimes feel doctors prescribe way too much medication - pushing the latest drug of choice, which may or may not be a good choice for me.  I prefer to research drugs before using them and would prefer a doctor that would respect when I say ""No that isn't suitable for me - find something else"".  but too many doctors prefer the ""take this pill"" solution."
1	My PCP was recommended to me and I felt comfortable around her from the first time we met.  We have similar views about certain issues and that leads me to believe that she will definitely have my best interest in mind.
1	I trust him because in the years that I have gone to him he doesn't seem to push anything on me as far as medication and most times gives me a practical way to work with illnesses I might have.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor.  She has never given me something I don't understand and has always explained things carefully and thoroughly.  I understand enough about my diet and lifestyle to know if she gives me a medication that I probably need it.
1	My primary care person is an advanced practice nurse practitioner. She has demonstrated a high level of active care for me, and is extremely thorough in her work when examining me. She is an exceptional listener, and has even detected health issues of which I was not aware. She communicates very well, and takes all the time I need to address my health concerns.
1	I have had my doctor for a while now and have been to him many times.  He has always been kind, gentle, intelligent, and informative.  I think that he really cares about his patients and me specifically so I trust what he has to say.
-1	I HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A DISTRUST IN DOCTORS.  HAVING CARED FOR AGING PARENTS AND A DAUGHTER WITH HEALTH ISSUES I FOUND MANY TIMES DOCTORS WERE NOT THOROUGH ENOUGH AND AT TIMES I FELT WERE GUESSING AT BEST.  DOCTORS ARE NOW TECHNICIANS AND NO LONGER HEALERS.
1	I trust my PCP because he is thoughtful and caring. He always asks about my health and if I have questions. He remembers my name and information we have discussed during prior appointments. He is thorough with examinations. He takes his time.
1	primary care physicians are there to help us, people may have different outlooks on treatment but none of them have a medical degree to back up there beliefs. We have doctors for a reason, they are trying to help us get well. Even a physical can make an error in treatment, I recently has a visit do the dermatologist and he prescribed me medication that did not help.There was no reason of me to be concerned, I called him back and got a different drug that helped. The amount of knowledge and understanding of science that the MD have is incredible. I'm very grateful for there service. Trusting your physician is important part of anybodies life, they will not harm you or judge you , they are there to help.
-1	My PCP is part of a group.  They need to see as many patients as possible.  They rarely have time to deliver quality health care and be able to think through all options.
1	 do not currently have a PC. in general i trust doctors because they are more knowledgeable than i am. this does not mean i do not see the value in second opinions, however, i recognize these are trained professionals who have a better understanding of any health issue i might have.
1	Because he is a good guy and I have known him a while now.  He often tells it like it is and doesnt sugarcoat things, but he is always honest.  He has often told me things that other doctors would tell me one way and he would say that was just a waste of money and it was.
-1	I think my primary care physician is really good at his job and I trust his recommendation most of the time.
1	I trust my doctor completely because he has saved my life in the past and helped me to better myself.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician. Over the years she has been correct many times, when it comes to my health. She has given me the best healthcare service. She has tried to improve my health time after time.
1	I trust my primary care physician cause they always lay it down straight forward in front of me about my conditions and the treatment options I have.
-1	Although my GP is most likely intends to do her correctly, with the high number of patients under her care I can't trust that she able to fulfill her responsibilities. With the private health care system dominating in a society where so many people are below the poverty line, it becomes impossible to see a GP more than once a year. If you develop any medical issue between the appointments the only option for so many Americans is to go to the emergency room.   
1	My pcp is thorough and listens to my opinions about my medical issues. She frequently informs me of my options and lets me decide what I think is best for myself, since I know more about my problems than her.
-1	I have a rare disease called Achalasia. I was so sick I lost over 170 lbs in less than a year, doctors kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me for a year. Doctors kept insisting I had bulimia and it was all in my head, this was not the case at all. If that was the case I would have been binge eating then forcing myself to vomit, instead I would take a few bites of something and regurgitate it afterwards. After seeing over 4 specialists I finally found a doctor who listened to me and understood what was going on and it wasn't in my head. The majority of doctors I saw didn't care about my symptoms and just wanted me out of their offices. This experience made it difficult for me to trust doctors in general. 
-1	I don't have a primary care. In the past all they have done is make my problem worse, not better. American medicine for the most part is just another way to make money.
1	I trust my doctors because I truly think they are looking out for me. I have friends who are nurses and they have all told me they've never seen anything to have them question a physician's judgement.
1	My current primary care physician is incredibly thorough in her evaluation of my health issues and in her explanation of the options available. Whenever she makes a recommendation she goes into a lot of detail about her logic behind the recommendation and explains why others might have a different opinion. I usually do some research after my appointments with all physicians in order to make sure that I understand all aspects of my illness or treatment and have never found the information my current doctor gives me to be lacking in any way.
-1	I feel that my primary care doctor often does not have nor take the time to listen to me thoroughly or allow me to ask in-depth questions.  Therefore, I cannot trust that the decisions that he makes for me is thoroughly informed. 
-1	For the most part I trust his knowledge.  I think the problem lies in our approaches to medical conditions. I am more interested in natural drug free options.  He may not always agree but he will allow me to make my own decisions.  
-1	My last primary care was a DO not an MD, and would not treat menopause as a medical condition.  I had to request a referral to an OB/GYN to treat my menopause symptoms.
-1	My doctor has consistently demonstrated a high level of knowledge and empathy to me when i talk with them about any health conditions. I dont feel like they judge me or take prejudice with me 
1	I am lucky to live in an area where I have access to qualified medical care. My medical conditions are complex; I need to be able to trust my doctors. If I have any doubt, I move on. Otherwise, I am just wasting my time and theirs.
-1	"Doctors are generally good, but they only work with what you give them.  They make mistakes as well.  They ""practice"" medicine.  I know my body best, and many times have successfully diagnosed my own problems.  Doctors go on evidence and when they don't find any, they can sometimes dismiss you.  But I feel deep down, we as patients know when something is not right within us.  "
1	We have built a relationship over the years. He knows my conditions and understands my thoughts and concerns about them. He wants me to be happy and healthy 
1	I go to the doctor when I am not feeling well and when they give me recommendations it is usually something that helps.
-1	I trust the medical expertise of the doctor. I do not, however, trust that they are doing the right thing all the time. My doctor's office, like others, is clearly there for insurance money, making us get lots of tests.
-1	I generally trust most doctors, while I don't have a primary care physician if I ever need professional medical help or advice I usually just go to the urgent care center and they have always been able to help me with my problems. So my trust level for them is average I would say, I don't necessarily believe everything a doctor says, but I also don't think everything is a lie they are telling me either. 
1	I trust most doctors simply on the fact that I know nothing about it and they are train and educated to know about it. Also, some doctors just seem more genuine in the bedside manner than others.
1	I have been going to him for years. He listens to what I say and tries to help me. If I am having a problem he will send me for test to see if anything is wrong. he sent me to have an echo cardiogram when someone said I had a heart mur mur. 
1	I trust my physician because I have checked his credentials before I have signed up with him. Also I have learned to trust him even more because my brother who is a doctor too in another country agrees to everything that my primary doctor says.
1	He is courteous and attentive. He is very informative and talks about every option available to me in regards to my health. I always feel as if he is treating me like I am his only patient, as he devotes all his time and attention to me in that moment.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician that I see regularly so it is hard to say. I based my answers on the times that I have seen doctors in the past. In general I think that doctors are trustworthy and do have the best interests of their patients at heart.
1	I have been going to him for a long time.  He listens to me and knows me and my history.  He values my input, as he says no one knows my body better than me.  When I had some financial problems, he understood and started with the most conservative course of action, while still giving me good care.
-1	I have been misdiagnosed with mental illnesses twice. He is quick to prescribe medication and get me out of the office and on my way. One of the medications I took had negative side effects and he was unconcerned. It seemed he just recommended it for the commission cash. That medication has since been recalled. Both the doctor and his medical assistant rush through questions during check-ups. I feel like I'm inconveniencing everyone by being there.
-1	I am a little wary of doctors and their personal interests, and how this may conflict with my interests, but I generally feel confident in my personal doctor. He has always been straightforward with me. 
1	I have been with my doctor for such a long time now that I trust them. They have never done me wrong and always help me out when I have a problem. 
-1	I feel like most Dr's are good and want to serve their patients in the best manner possible. However, there are some that are self serving and will recommend care for what is convienent or will generate the most monetary reward.
-1	I use a Patient First and although they are my primary care, I do not have one physician that I see.  I often see a Physician's Assistant or a different doctor every time.  It is hard to trust this situation.
-1	I feel like my doctor takes the time to talk to me and truly understand what I need. If he didnt, I would switch doctors
-1	I have never been in one place long enough to establish a primary care physician. I think it depends on how connected I feel to them, if I feel rushed and that they don't care then I am less willing to talk to them honestly or feel confidence in their opinion.
-1	I feel like my doctor is very capable and knows what he is doing.  However, I think he tries to schedule too many patients in one day, leaving very little time to tend to each patient.  Each time I go in, I feel like he hasn't even read my chart and I have to explain my situation to him each time like I am a new patient.
-1	I have had some recent negative experiences with my doctor perscribing certain medications that have extreme negative side effects and my assumption as to why this medication was prescribed to me was because of the comission the doctor receives from the pharmaceutical company.
-1	I mostly trust but I also know that doctors do not know everything and they make mistakes too. I also have heard many stories of people having doctors who push their own agendas or make decisions based on what is easiest and safest for them and I worry about that happening to me. 
-1	I just think that sometimes doctors do what is easier and convenient and time-effective rather than giving me the time and attention I may need.
1	I trust my doctor, because she is very thourough, and very careful. She is ver concervative in prescribing any and all medications. Sometimes I wish she wasn't so concervative, but I'm grateful she is. Most Drs. just throw medication at you, she does not. She looks for other alternatives first, if that doesn't work, they she'll try meds, but very concervatively.
1	My doctor is honest and takes what I say into consideration instead of having God complex like a lot of doctors seem too.
1	I trust him the most because since I started going to his office my life has changed for the better. I feel great about myself and I think that is all thanks to him.
1	I've been seeing my primary care physicians for over 5 years now.  He has never failed me in letting me know what my problems are.  I completely trust him when it comes to my health.
-1	I mostly trust my primary care physician. However, there have been a few times where I go to this person over something and the doctor gave me bad/unhelpful advice.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. He always address my problems. At times I feel I have to remind him of something and than he agree to look at the problem.But always addresses my issues and look further to be sure things are OK&gt;
-1	The nurse practitioners have started to slowly replace primary physicians. I have had negative experiences being touched inappropriately by a physicians. I distrust their motives.
-1	Just started going somewhere new and haven't really been that impressed.  They seem to rush through and don't explain things in as much detail as i would prefer. 
1	She seems to have my best care in mind. Also she has taken care of all my questions with care.  Andshe consults with the other professionals in her network. So she has earned my trust and I hope to continue in her care.
-1	I have issues sometimes with the doctor's staff doing things to make my treatment more difficult. They sometimes do things against my doctor's orders.
-1	He has made mistakes and has misdiagnosed both my wife and I. He can be very arrogant and moody too. At times, he can be downright dismissive. He got fired from MedExpress. At other times he is helpful and more thorough thinking outside of the box to find the source of an ailment.
1	I trust my doctor for the most part because he has never given me any reason not to. Everytime i do go to my doctor, he usually is very helpful in figuring out whats wrong and solving it. He also never tries to get me to take any medications  that will have bad side effects, and is really compromising in all aspects. 
-1	I mostly trust doctors, but complete trust has to be built up over time.  And doctors are people too and make mistakes.  I believe they try to do their best, but sometimes they are working with limited information - I don't always remember to tell them everything.
-1	I have developed a great deal of trust in him over the many years I have been seeing him. My father recommended my doctor and because my father is a physician , that made me trust him right away. 
1	I have never felt any reason to not trust my doctor. I feel as if they try and do their best to figure out what my issues are. Until then, I will trust them.
-1	I've started to distrust her as of late. She seems more interested in just refilling my prescriptions and getting me out the door than actually helping me solve my problems. 
1	"My new doctor is quite friendly in every interaction I've had with them be it in person, over the phone, or through online messaging. He makes eye contact and generally has a smile on his face. You can just ""feel"" that he genuinely cares about his job and helping his patients. He actively listens to everything I have to say, and I get the impression he hears my hesitation or what I don't say just as much as my words. I don't just feel like a patient with him, but a member of a team. We work together to come up with the best plan of action in treating my health needs."
1	I completely trust my primary care physician. She is a kind, considerate and thorough doctor who shows genuine concern for her patients.
1	I trust my doctor because I am able to discuss about my health and receive appropriate care.  My doctor appointments have been good and I am able to understand and learn about my health during my check-ups.  I am able to ask questions regarding my physical and mental health and receive a professional answer from my doctor.  I trust my doctor and the services being offered at clinics, health centers, and hospitals.  During my visits to clinics, health centers, and hospitals, I was cared for, treated, and given appropriate care from staff.  I love the work that nurses and doctors do and will continue to check-up on my health.  
-1	I do not trust all doctor's . My perception is based on a negative response I had with a doctor some years ago. . I did not like her results and when I went with another opinion with another doctor it turned out that  I did the right thing by doing so, Because my primary doctor was way off on her prognosis.
1	I have a personal connection with my doctor. It is just something that occurs, chemistry, that I feel about some people. Once that connection is made it is just easy to trust what he is telling me. I can think of no reason why he would tell me things that weren't true and would not be in my interest.
-1	My doctor has only ever been helpful and kind when I've visited her. So far, her recommendations have been positive and yielded good results.
-1	I often feel like the doctors are overworked and they have to rush between patients, so they only spend a few minutes with you. This isn't really enough time to be thorough and careful despite how good their intentions might be. I don't have a problem with communicating to the nurses, but I sometimes wonder if all of the information is actually being conveyed to the doctor or not.
-1	In the past when I have had medical issues, my current primary care physician has brushed me off and not listened to my concerns. Through my own research and self advocacy, I was able to get the resources I needed, but definitely not with much assistance from my own physician. 
-1	I completely trust my physician. The main reason why I completely trust my physician is because I have been going to the same physician for ten years now. I feel like my physician knows exactly how to treat my symptoms. 
1	I trust my Primary care doctor because he respects me and the knowledge I have about my health and body. I have some different health issues and he lets me somewhat control my treatment. He listens well to what I tell him about my body and asks thoughtful questions. He helps me plan my treatment, and defers to my preferences. He's not a pushover, but he is aware that I'm the one living in my body, so i know my body best of anyone. And i really appreciate that!
1	I have brain tumors. That diagnosis came totally out of the blue and I was devastated. I ended up with the best doctor, and he saved my life. And he also made me understand that things would be okay. He moved away to teach not long ago, and I've saved his last voicemail to me just because hearing him always makes me feel better about life.
-1	i often have to seek a second opinion because i don't think my doctor really understands my problem. she is good for easy things, like a flu shot or antibiotics prescription, but i would not trust her to correctly diagnose and treat a more complicated issue.  
1	I have been with my current primary care physician for over a decade now. We have developed an excellent rapport. I have no doubt that when I come to him with an issue, that he will be thorough and thoughtful.
-1	I trust them as much a I distrust them. I  am not a paranoid person but I would like to understand what medical procedures are being done on me and what the effects will be.
-1	I have change doctors in the last 6 months and am just starting to get to know them and what what type of caring person and how they work with me and the staff they have in the office. I do know they the few time I have been in the office I was not to draw in to this doctor, but mt dealing with the staff has been great they call back within a good time frame and have been very helpful with what I may need at that time
-1	The physician i see most often is my pain clinic nurse practitioner. I see two different guys and they contradict each other at least once every two months. It is hard for me to trust what either of them say because neither seems to be interested in healing my problem, only covering up or masking the problem. We have reached a wall and the only other option that could be recommended would be surgery but one physician feels I am too young and not in enough pain. Nothing either of them have done has worked to help my pain so it is hard for me to feel confident in any of their suggestions.
-1	My doctor himself is trustworthy, however, as he works for a for-profit hospital I know sometimes his decisions are based on money and he has to follow certain rules based on how his bosses see to make money. In order to have complete trust in him he would need to work for a non-profit
-1	the doctor profession is a divine profession, I have great respect towards them, they know our body situation better so I trust the doctors verymuch
-1	I just can't trust doctors any more.  I think they are like mechanics and just trying to upsell me on every little thing that they do.  Every stupid appointment is two hundred bucks.  just stupid
-1	I feel that the business side of things makes it really hard for doctor and care give to give the best service as possible. I think they are push to see you longer then they need to and add on service that you really don't need. I think that they are good people but I think that management get to involved in health care.
1	I trust my PCP because I have been going to see her for a long time and I know she values me as an individual.
-1	My primary care physician has led me astray before, and a substitute doctor almost killed me. I had issues with my gall bladder and my doctor did not catch the signs of that happening, even though I was making appointments for a knee issue. Also, my knee issue was misdiagnosed as well. She did do a good job telling me all the treatments available for my knee issue, and she did diagnose the arthritis in my foot accurately.
1	I think my dr takes the time to listen to me and give me good feed back when needed.  He is also good at referring me to the correct ppl.
-1	Overall I feel that doctors are honest and trustworthy. For the most part I believe that doctors want to help their patients and will do what is best.
-1	I haven't had that much medically wrong with me through my life. I had my tonsils and adnoids taken out, we thought I had a hernia when I was in junior high and one bout of skin cancer a few years ago but other than that, it's pretty much been colds, flus and bee stings. I've never had a problem with a doctor. I've never had a doctor lie to me, or at least, I've never found out about it. I generally trust people and that holds true for doctors as well. 
-1	At this current time in my life I do not have a primary care doctor so I would be discussing doctors in general as a whole. I feel the training they received from medical schools is geared towards treating symptoms and prescribing medications and not curing the issue. This would be due to Pharmaceutical industry having such a firm holm on lobbying the medical education system. Doctors need funding and will do what is needed or asked in order to get said funding. It is a business and that means the end user/patient is not always going to be the focus of concern.
-1	She is personable and competent, but like most doctors, she prefers treatment over prevention. She is not always interested in the root cause of something.
1	I think my doctor really cares about his patients, as all should. I've never once even gotten a slight implication that my doctor wasn't doing what was best for me.
1	My primary care physician makes decisions where we both have input in and both discuss what is best for me; he doesn't make a decision for me, we both work together. 
1	"My doctor has spent time during my visits to listen to everything I say. He listens to me like a therapist. He will even call me from his cell phone after business hours to discuss test results as he gets them. He's always been very thorough in explaining medical conditions and terms and treatments. He always ""fixes"" me quickly."
-1	I have been with my doctor for many years, he has done a great job taking care of me. I have no reason to mistrust him or suspect some hidden motives.
1	I trust my doctor because he genuinely shows concern for my health. He explains all of my options along with short and long term effects. He is attentive to my concerns and offer effective plans  and he is there when i need him
-1	I trust most doctors I go to I normally go off of their attitudes, I dont like a doctor that doesnt show compassion or caring, thats how I rate a doctor.
-1	I trust and do not trust my doctor. I believe that they will do their best to help me. Although, I also think that they might add in unneeded tests just so that they can get more money.
1	They have been through extensive training in the subject area and certainly at the very least know more than I do, and have no reason to want to deceive me
-1	I get a general vibe off my instincts on how I feel I should feel about it. There are some doctors that I trust and some I do not on that alone. 
-1	I think that the doctor has my best health and happiness in mind when making decisions. I ultimately think that the doctor makes a lot of money, but that this also motivates him to give me the best available care.
-1	I want to trust my doctor, or any doctor. I sometimes have a hard time doing so though because all-in-all, it is just a profession and if these doctors fixed all sick people and issues happened less and less, doctors jobs would become more and more scarce so some things are not treated properly or correctly so that it can keep people in the healthcare system to make money and keep doctor's jobs.
-1	Doctors in general: They are narcissistic, arrogant snakes who care more about their country club membership payments than patients. I repeatedly have received misdiagnoses and inadequate when it comes to doctors such that I now view them as a means to an end--the end being the laboratory test results and that's about it. Dr. Google has served me far better than any doctor ever has.
-1	My doctor is intelligent and easy to open up to for the most part.  But sometimes I feel rushed.  Sometimes I feel she is a bit condescending or quick to jump to conclusions.  I generally feel she is not as thorough as I would like.  I supplement the visit with a lot of internet research.  I mainly go to her for basic checkups.  It's very hard to find a doctor who you really like, who listens to you, who doesn't rush you, who you trust, who you feel comfortable talking openly with, who is non judgemental, who takes your insurance and continues to take your insurance, who gives you good answers to your medical problems, who has a competent and caring staff.  In the end I think most people settle for someone who meets some of those characteristics.  Or maybe they just stay with a doctor they are unhappy with.  Sometimes you can't always find what you want.  But I do think the medical professionals and the insurance industry should do a lot better.
-1	i trust my doctor because he treats well and gives all the information i need. whether its good or bad. there is an app where all the lab reports are uploaded directly and he has asked me to log in to it so that i dont feel anything is hidden from me
-1	Well, because unfortunately doctoring is a profession, and legal practice if you will. Therefore, there is a certain amount of accountability and responsibility that they must exercise, therefore I may come second to that.
1	She takes time to concentrate on my problems and my needs. She always offers me the best advices and guidelines
1	My doctor has always been very well educated on any problems that i've had. He is very intuitive and understanding and will always give me an honest answer regardless of the situation. His dedication to his patients has been simply amazing.
1	For me, it is because I was his office nurse for 28 years, so I know him very well.  He is a good doctor.  I did not always agree with everything he said, but as a patient or as an employee, we could still work it out.
-1	I always feel that I am rushed when I go to the dr. The usually ask a couple of questions and make there decisions that way instead of examining or running test.
-1	Usually my appointments are so quick I feel like they just want to get me in and out of the office as quickly as possible and are annoyed if I ask too many questions
1	I feel comfortable with her.  I believe she has the same philosophy as me as to healing holistically vs. medically. 
-1	I trust them most of the time but I tend to not rely too much on their answers when it comes to what medicines to prescribe. I was told by another physician that many doctors have contracts with certain pharmaceutical companies, and because of this they are persuaded to recommend that company's medications, even though they know it won't fix their pain or conditions. Since they have a contract, they are forced to push the company they have a contract with's products over others. 
-1	So the surgery went incredibly well with only one nurse having poor bedside manner. The issue was the follow-up procedures. Radiation was all set up and ready to go before a sudden visit to the oncologist was scheduled. And we were informed that we were a month behind schedule. After that, suddenly radiation had to be pushed back over two months so four sessions of chemo could be forced through. We don't go to the first surgeon/general practitioner anymore. Apparently that's common with most surgeons: once they're done with you, you yourself don't need help anymore, even if you clearly do.
1	I trust my primary care physician implicitly.  If I did not trust her, I would find another doctor.  My doctor is caring and always takes the time to discuss all of my questions about my health.  She is not an alarmist.  She always remains calm and is not upsetting regardless of the health issues that are needed to be dealt with.   
-1	I think that the doctors I have used are traditional thinkers and that they refuse to think about alternatives other than traditional treatments. I do not think they take into account other options, especially holistic treatments.
-1	I trust my doctor because I know a lot of other people who see her too.  Others in the medical field have told me how good she is too. 
-1	the doctor seem to rushed to be totally trusted. He sometimes seems to have made a decision very early in the process and ignores evidence as I present it. he is also under pressure from insurers to provide the low cost options. there I have been times when I have mentioned more modern thinking or treatments and he was unreceptive.
1	My doctor is fairly new to me.  I have only seen her a couple of times.  So far, I feel that she is trustworthy and has explained why the need for certain tests and paths of treatment.  She is educated, warm and very friendly
1	I trust my neurologist because she is very knowledgeable and informed regarding all of my medical conditions. I have complete trust in her
-1	"I've been through 3 primaries in the past 4 months, trying to get diagnosed and treated for hypothyroidism. None has been a great experience; the first one was very hard to reach, the second ignored my question about additional tests (I left a message with the receptionist and never got a return call), and the third, while explaining one part about how insurance works that the other two should have done (they all knew I'd been out of the ""system"" for more than 20 years), also ignored a question I left with a receptionist. I'm not sure whether I will stay with her. At this point I feel like there is no such thing as a good PCP."
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for years. I have gone to him for my ongoing health issues. I trust his treatment options and decisions. If I don't agree with something or a medication prescribed, he is open to listening to what I have to say. He does not rush me through an appointment like some of my previous doctors. For this reason, I have complete trust in my primary care physician.
-1	I have had good and bad doctors before. The good ones really seem to care and take the time to listen. They are able to help me thoroughly. Very few doctors have been bad. They seem to not listen and want to prescribe something that I don't agree with.
-1	Again, I think that the main reason is my inability to 'self-diagnose' and communicate my concerns with them. There is also something of a mistrust of the system within which they work as there are so many constraints upon doctors due to insurance coding and coverage. It seems to interfere with their ability to offer care.
1	"She has always been correct with her diagnosis.  Most people would rate her low, due to the fact that she takes a lot of time with each patient, so her wait times are in the hours, at times.  However, she is spending quality time, with each patient.  Making sure she doesn't just, ""put a Band-Aid"" as a solution but she tries to find out what is causing the issue.  For example, my husband went in with a bloody nose, she didn't just give him medicine, she spent time with him and did tests to figure out why his nose kept bleeding."
-1	My current Primary Care Physician is not even a physician.  She is only a nurse practitioner.  Every time Iâve gone to see her she has literally said âI just donât know what to tell you.â  âIâm not really sure what is going onâ.  After she did some research online, she came to the same conclusion that I already had by searching online.
-1	I distrust most doctors because I believe they are mostly concerned about money.  Most of them don't care how your health really is.
1	I have been seeing my pcp for the last 20 years.  he is kind, thoughtful, and smart.  He sees his patients as people, and has a full understanding of their needs.  He is an amazing doctor who has actual conversations with his patients.
-1	They take the time to listen to me and explain what they are doing and thinking. Sometimes they are rushed, but overall, I think they are doing well.  
1	She spends lots of time answering my questions and discussing all facets of every situation.  She answers questions thoroughly and never seems like she's in a rush.  
1	I trust my doctor to an extent. I am aware that no one doctor has all of the answers so i try to take her advice with a grain of salt
-1	I TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN MY DOCTOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND HE KNOWS MY CHART. 
1	I completely trust my doctor and his judgment. Thus far, he has always been professional, yet caring and compassionate. He fully explains his decisions and why they are the best for me. All of the risks and benefits or each option are given to me, as well as what he thinks is best and why. My doctor will also explain other options and why he would or would not choose them. 
-1	my doctor is very friendly with me and i relate to him as a person of similar age, race, and gender. we seem to get along almost as friends
-1	I belong to a family care practice. I only go once a year for monitoring of my condition. Each time I go there is a new doctor right out of medical school assigned to me. The old doctor has moved on. It is hard to generate trust if the old face has gone somewhere else. 
1	I trust her because she is a very honest person. I have her cell number and she is always abvailable.
1	I have a lot of trust in my doctors. Case and point was last year when I wanted to change my birth control. I was on the pill and wanted to have the implant in my arm. My doctor came in before and went over all the other types of birth control and all the benefits and side effects to all of them. Once we got through that and I still wanted the implant she proceeded. While she was putting the implant in I asked her why she asked all those questions even though I scheduled the implant. She said she felt people didn't look at all the information that is out there and sometimes people don't know all the different options they have. She wanted me to know and understand all my options before going forward so I made the best decision for myself. 
-1	Sometimes I feel they are only in it for the money. I feel they might order something that I do not need done or some other added expense for no reason. Usually this is not the case and they are usually out for my best interest but I feel they sneak a few things in there. I can usually trust my provider to get me the help that I need and that they are being honest with me and careful to treat me right. 
-1	I trust my doctor implicitly. He is more internal medicine, so I have been able to see the same doctor since I was a child. My parents saw him, I even have a couple friends who were delivered by him. He has been practicing medicine in the community for decades longer than I've been alive, and he's always had excellent bedside manner. Everyone loves him. 
-1	I appreciate everything that physicians do for their patients, although I sometimes feel as though certain doctors are motivated to perform a particular action because of personal financial gain. That, or sometimes certain doctors do not show a great sense of genuine interest towards their patients.
-1	I trust my doctor with my medical health care needs. I don't have any reason not to trust her with my questions and concerns about my medical health care. 
1	My doctor has been with me through all of my children, he has helped deliver them and he knows what i am interested in and what I am not interested in. He finds ways to bring other options on the table when I do not agree with what he or another doctor has said.
-1	I feel like we almost have no choice but to have a general trust in our doctors, right? Otherwise, what else is there? I am not naive enough to believe that there aren't plenty with special interests and motivations beyond doing their jobs well and with care, but a certain trust has to exist.
-1	In general I trust my doctor, that being said I know that s/he has a heavy case load and i may not get all the attention i need. Also I know that insurance, HMO's and pharma influences decision making/medical advice i receive
-1	well, you baited a lot of negative opinions about primary care. Also, I have issue with your question which assumes that primary care is bad. It's not. People like it. It can make you a comfortable living, and can be extremely rewarding just like any other specialty.
-1	I don't like spending money to see a doctor when I am not sick. I avoid hospitals at all costs because of the associated costs. I won't see a doctor unless I'm really sick/in immense pain.
-1	I have not been with her long, but certain things have fallen through the cracks, like orders for follow-up tests. She's also not show much curiosity in helping me identify problems.
1	I feel like if they have been through so much schooling, I should trust them as long as they keep up with new medical findings.
1	My doctor has always been very upfront and honest with me about my physical condition and what treatments I need to take even if they might not be what I want.  He always asks about my well being as about my family and will even recommend me to seek other consolation if it is beyond his expertise. I consider him a friend as well as a doctor.
-1	The way the laws are setup in this country I feel doctors have to tiptoe around certain issues. For example, If I am in severe pain I feel they would try as many remedies as possible before offering me pain medication due to the stigma the FDA puts on doctors who prescribe them. I feel like a criminal just asking for help with severe pain. If this is how they treat me with that one issue, what other issues are they making worse to protect their own license?
1	I feel that my doctor is typically very attentive and does a thorough job. However, there are times where it feels like they might be rushing a bit. If I ever had something serious going on, I would definitely seek a second opinion so I do not blindly trust my doctor. 
1	I have a PCP but I answered these questions regarding my OBGYN because that is the doctor I see most frequently as I have had 2 rough pregnancies over the past few years. I do trust her to take the best care of me. Last spring / summer, she made the decision that I should take progesterone shots beginning at 16 weeks and that I needed to be hospitalized during the second trimester of my pregnancy because of complications. I spent about 2 months there and because of the choices she made regarding my care, I was able to have a healthy baby boy at 35 weeks. She erred on the side of caution because she knew my previous baby had been born suddenly 7 weeks early. Moving forward, if I have any more children I will definitely want to continue under her care because I trust her.
-1	Alot of doctors care about making more money not about peoples actual needs. As in they make money off of giving prescriptions. You see so many people taking medicine. People dieing faster off taking medications prescribed by the doctor.
-1	i trust my primary care physician because i have been going to him for the longest time and i have not had any reason to believe otherwise
-1	They do have more schooling then I do and they continue to learn about different diseases and treatments. The one's I have seen pretty much put everything straight out there for you, they don't dance around the subjects and the sometimes admit they don't know what's wrong instead of just trying to label you and move you along. 
1	I'm not a big doctor person. If I can solve it, fix it and feel better on my own then I'm going to. I like my primary care physician though because he understands my nerves and does his best to calm me down. He's been practicing for over 30 years so I feel confident that he has expansive knowledge. His office is modern and high tech, so I feel he keeps up with the times and is up to date with the latest procedures, drugs and treatments. He's always available on call and has no issues coming to the hospital to check on his patients all hours of the night. He's a family man and very trusting. I'm 100% happy and secure with my care in his hands.
-1	I have had a past where there have been some missed diagnosis. Because of this I do not always trust they they are taking the time to get the job done well and make sure they are doing the right thing when it comes to my health. 
-1	I do not trust doctors or really any kind of medical professional.  In fact, most of the time they don't even seem that professional at their jobs.  From my personal experience, it seems like doctors are only concerned with getting each patient in and out as quickly as possibly so that they can see more patients which of course lead to the doctors making more money.
-1	I just got a new Doctor and he is very good and explains everything to me very well which makes me feel like he is concerned and wants to make sure I understand.
-1	I trust my doctors because they went to medical school and I did not. So I believe them over myself.
1	I trust her because she is a strong female. Currently she serves in the Army National Guard and just got home from overseas. She is as tough as they come and listens well. I am a little intimidated to tell her things in relation to myself at times because she is so strong. Overall, she knows my home situation and understands being a full time caretaker is a hard job. She makes referrals when necessary and only lets me try meds that she knows will not make me too tired to care for my family member. I don't feel like a number when I see her. Nice office staff helps too!
1	I have been seeing my primary physician for over 20 years. He takes care of my physical health as well as mental health. He is always honest about treatment options and I feel he cares deeply about being thorough and careful.
-1	I trust my primary care physician, because she always takes the time to listen to my concerns and my symptoms.  She's willing to take extra time to make sure she understands what my issues are, and she offers different solutions to the problem.  She ultimately allows me to make the final call on what I want to do.  Once I decide, she explains the treatment in depth and makes sure I have a good understanding prior to me leaving her office.
-1	He always seems busy and I have had him misdiagnose something to where I had to return for a follow up and  different treatment due to him not spending the time initially.  I am currently searching for a new DR. 
-1	I sometimes don't trust my doctor because of her negative reviews that are public on Google. However she is usually kind to me and tries to suggest what her opinions are rather than making it sound like that's absolutely the problem. She tends to prescribe me something to see if it helps and tells me to come back at a later date if the problem still persists. 
1	My doctor has always proved to be a trustworthy person.  He's been very helpful to me.  The one time something was very wrong with me, he attended to my needs in a thoughtful and respectful way.
1	I like my doctor and I can relate to him. He's a very funny guy, uses humor to relax his patients and to communicate.  It works!  He gets to the heart of the matter quickly.
1	I trust my primary care physician in that I believe that he will have my best interests in mind while not trying to rush me out of the door to see the next patient.
1	I feel that my doctor does not have any reason to lie about something. I also know a few things myself and can tell by my doctor's body language. I am able to research the doctor's advice myself and compare it.
-1	I trust my Primary care physician for the most part, however, if he were to put me on a drug of some sort, I'm not sure he would be open to exploring all drugs used to treat a condition, or if he would choose the drug that he is comfortable with, or the drug of the sales rep that brought in lunch that day.  Overall, though, I do think he has my best interests at heart and wouldn't do anything to harm me.
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he also has experience in alternative medicine. He takes in consideration that you are a whole person(body,mind,and spirit). He is honest about what your options are when he tells you the symptoms. .  
-1	I could only say that I can't agree totally on number one because I have personally seen that my doctor's waiting room was empty without patients being seen at the time and have still been made to wait excessive amounts of time for my own appointments on numerous occasions.
-1	The doctor that I have now pushes the medication option.  My previous doctor did the same.  I know they are doing the basics for me.  But I'm not that good a patient and I don't always follow their orders.
-1	Because as much as they are trained to remove personal opinions it is near impossible for slight bias' not to be within a doctors recommendation. Also what they are more familiar with they will feel more comfortable recommending. For example a surgeon will always be more comfortable with a surgical approach, while an internist with a medicinal approach. All advice in life should always be taken with a grain of salt. 
-1	I do not feel like my doctor is committed to getting me the best treatment. I like my doctor but I don't think that she views me as much else than an insurance claim.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because they know there stuff. They went to school for a long time to know all the stuff. If they mess up they are gonna hear it from me.
1	In the past, I have not trusted my physicians. I felt they did not take the time to follow through with care.  My current doctor is thorough and seems to care to exhaust all possible ways to figure out to make me feel better and also seems to notice how a patient feels at the time of the visit
1	He's a trained professional and has always been open and honest with me and always lays out the options for treatment when I have any issues.  He's polite courteous and very intelligent.  
-1	I do not have a primary physician, but I did have a cardiologist in which I seen somewhat often. For the most part I trusted him with the tests he authorized for me to do to find out what my condition was before coming to a conclusion because he went to rule everything else out before I received my diagnosis. I generally trust him, however I know that doctors do not work for the welfare of the people, but the welfare of deepening their pockets. The old doctor vow was to help people and to recommend dietary changes to promote health and well-being. Now it's about their contracts with Big Pharma and prescribing poisonous and toxic medications to create a lifelong patient and to create more money for themselves. In general, I believe my doctor's intention were in the right place, but I'm fully aware of the scam and can see through it all, so I generally do not trust them.    
1	I tend to trust the professionals who show a passion for the work that they do. If the connection and relationship between the patient and doctor is not present then I find a new primary care physician. There is no room for mistrust in medicine. 
-1	I feel like doctors always rush through appointments. I feel like a lot of times they act like I'm making it up.
1	MY PULMONARY DOCTOR IS THE ONE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF MY LUNG FIBROSIS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP MY GOING SINCE 2008. I HAVE GONE TO MAYO CLINIC WITH HIS SUGGESTION TO GET SECOND OPINIONS TWICE AND MAYO AND MY PULMONARY DOCTOR COME TOGETHER WITH A PLAN TO EFFECTIVELY KEEP ME GOING.
-1	I often feel like They do not full understand that some treatment options although a little safer might cause more of a daily issue for the patient. My physician also shames me on things that I can not control rather than offer help
-1	I honestly don't have a lot of trust in my primary care physician. I say that mainly because I haven't had a lot of interaction with him. In addition to that my interactions that I've had with him have not been really positive. I've felt rushed in those interactions and I don't get a sense of him really caring about well being of his patients.
-1	I trust that for the most part my doctor is open and honest about everything, but on the other hand it never hurts to get a second opinion about things involving my health. I trust that my doctor has no reason to lie to me or not give me all the information I need but sometimes things can be overlooked. 
-1	My primary care doctor is part of a large company. That company has huge turnaround, a huge patient base and relies heavily on billing. My primary care doctor probably wouldn't recognize me on the street.
1	My primary care physician has become a friend and is concerned about my health beyond medical appointments.  She acknowledges when she doesn't know a detail, researches and follows up with an answer.  She's active in her professional community, speaking and writing.  
-1	I distrust my primary care physician because one time when me and my sister both went for a check-up, he prescribed both of us potassium pills. I was living on campus for college at the time and had a completely different diet than my sister back at home. It was strange that all of a sudden, we both had low potassium. I ended up not taking mine because mine were huge pills that were a capsule, and I have a hard time swallowing pills. I just ate a couple bananas for a few days. He never prescribed them to us again.
1	He is always warm and welcoming, very professional but he smiles enough to not make me nervous. The top reason I'm happy with him though, is because he actually treats me when I am ill, before I had him I ended up with shingles, and my current doctor (back then) told me that I'd have to tough it out. I switched to him immediately and he got me the medication I needed, he even had his office call me to see how I was feeling. 
1	I trust my doctor because they always take the time that they need in order to help me, even if they are backed up.   They never rush me.  They make sure that all of my questions are answered.
-1	I trust him because he is a good doctor that has always been able to treat what I am to see him for.  He is been in the same place for many years and has many patients so he must know what he is doing to stay in the same place for so long retaining so many patients.
1	I like and trust my PC physcian because we actually discuss my issues, treatments and options, I can bring up ideas she has not brought up and we can discuss them, she is open,  I can make my decision based on my needs and she is supportive.
-1	I feel that my doctor, who is nearing the end of her career (upper 60's) and thinking about retirement in the next year or two is no longer placing my needs first.  I think she's having some sort of compassion fatigue and it doing a lot of things that are easier for her rather than giving me the proper care I am paying for and deserve.  I've gone to this doctor for over 20 years and it's difficult to see this happen however, I think the end of this doctor patient relationship is near either due to her impending retirement or me finding a replacement prior.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I know they put in the time to learn the skill. I also trust them because they keep up on everything.
-1	My doctor told me to stop asking questions about medications and just trust her. I did not think that was a good answer.
-1	I feel like I can trust my primary care physician because I do not sense that he would provide bad advice.  I do sometimes have concerns because while his intentions are good he might not be aware of every condition or treatment option.  Sometimes I feel like seeing a specialist is the best alternative.
1	I generally trust my primary care physician because outside of the fact that he's gone to school for a long time to be a medical professional and knows a heck of a lot more than me, he also seems like a good person, who actually cares about his patients. The only reason I don't have complete trust of him, is he's still human, and humans make mistakes. Even Doctors.That being said, even though I trust him, and the diagnoses he may make, or the medication he may put me on. I'm still going to do my own research on the topics at home.
1	There are a few people in my life that I have to give complete trust to and my doctor is one of those people. He just comes across to me as being knowledgeable and sincere and I have the real impression that he is doing the best he can with the situation that presents itself. 
-1	I have collaborated professionally with doctors and know that they often do not know how to interpret the results of a drug or the results of a scientific paper. So I am a little hesitant to trust their knowledge as the perfect gospel. I trust doctors that are upfront, direct, and friendly.
1	After numerous doctors that could not diagnose my conditions, I began seeing my current internist 5 years ago. After our first meeting she called me numerous times at home, sometimes in the evening to discuss past medical she found in my records. She always made time for me and what she could not do for me, she referred me to specialists where she monitors my care with each. My life and health are better as a result.
-1	Doctors do what the hiarchy tells them what to do. In this day and age, our health condition is a push-pull battle between our insurance plans, and how much influence the drug companies have over the doctor's profit potentual for prescribing what is best in their best income, not what is best for the patient. For that reason, I really don't trust anyone unless I can verify their recommendations without a shadow of a doubt that they are not selling me out.
1	My primary care doctor has been in the medical profession for many years and is very well-respected in our local community.  He is direct and honest, and open to ideas about my and my family's treatment options. 
1	I trust my primary care physician as they have done a really good job of diagnosing me and getting me the care I need so far. They have helped direct me to people that were able to help me with things that they were not trained to do (specialists) and in a very short amount of time. They have been able to help me with my scoliosis and have always been very positive. 
1	I trust my primary care physician very much and the nurse practitioner, my therapist, and the people that I have seen for my health in general. They are all skilled and very knowledgeable, and seem like they truly care for me. If I have extra questions, which I pretty much always do, they always take extra time out to talk things over with me thoroughly. 
-1	i know that doctors are experts, but they are often wrong about things. sometimes they dont listen to what the patient is really telling them.
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician for many different reasons. First off, I believe he prescribes medication for even the smallest symptoms. This is usually not necessary, and most of the time just gives a financial burden. I also believe that they don't fully check your symptoms to check if it is something more severe, and rather just plays it off like its the flu and that it'll go away after a while. 
1	I moved from Ohio to Florida 4 years ago  and health care in Florida is far inferior. I have never been seen by the doctor where I go because I see the PA because the only reason I go is to get my meds managed.  I like and trust the PA but it will never be completely.  I am still feeling the sting about a situation that occurred a year ago that was extremely critical and the doctor overseeing the PA who is ultimately in charge totally let me down.   It was cold and impersonal and there was no commitment to me as a patient what so ever. Horrible and extremely stressful experience
1	My doctor takes a lot of time and effort to explain my conditions to me. He gives guidance for modifying my diet in connection with my medication. He also gives directions to appropriate resource persons. He also provides scientific literature regarding my condition.
-1	He has a lot of medical knowledge, and he cares a lot about his patients.  Most recently I went into see him to get a small internal bump in my inner thigh examined.  After he gave me a physical examination, he determined that it was not cancerous and posed little risk as he thought it was a cyst.  He gave me multiple options:  do nothing, an ultrasound, or surgical removal.  The fact that he gave me multiple treatment options shows me that he cares about my needs, and I am grateful that he puts a lot of the care decisions in the patients' hands while taking to explain the pros/cons of different treatment options.
-1	My doctor is a good and caring doctor, and I do feel he has my best interests at heart. However, I can tell he is busy and overscheduled.
1	I trust my doctor because we have built a solid relationship over the years and there is mutual respect involved. He will tell me the truth whether its easy to hear or not, and he will listen to hear what I need to do better. 
1	I generally don't have any complex conditions and usually only receive preventative screenings. However, when I was pregnant and seeing a doctor on a regular basis, I do believe she had the depth of experience regarding my condition and trusted that she would provide great care for me. I followed her advice and believe my pregnancy had no issues because of her care.
-1	I believe for the most part my doctor sees hundreds of patients and is on a time restraint.  I feel that the rush to get people in and out makes looking for the most convenient option the first response. That the doctor does not know me or the other patients well enough to have a relationship beyond our charts that he barely looks over as he is coming in the room and that the nurse has actually more details and stake in personal care.
-1	I have visited a lot of Primary Care Physicians and finally have one I trust. He is extremely knowledgeable and great at answering any question no matter how small. She gives me multiple treatment and medication options and lets me decide what path I would like to take.
1	Doctors seeing lower income people don't get reimbursed well. Medi-Cal reimbusement rates are dismal and doctors aren't getting paid to see these patients. This means less doctors come to the area and we don't have a wide enough incentive to bring in high quality doctors or even keep them well paid or keep their buildings looking nice. Their surroundings seem lower tier and they often have too many patients since there aren't enough doctors. The doctors I've seen required travel. If a doctor gets recommended by someone else, I'm more trusting of the doctor. While there are some red flags to some people, I've never had an issue with an doctor at a clinic or a big hospital. They've always been able to guide me to a solution.
-1	I feel like they rush through my concerns and questions.  Explanations can be in excess or too little. I havenât found a Dr. I really like in awhile.
-1	Why I trust my my primary care physician is because they are trained to help me feel better from the illnesses that I have. Also the physician would not be in this field if they did not want to help those around them. 
-1	I believe that most doctors want what is best for their patients. But due to fast pace and so many patients they see I don't think that doctors can always fully give everyone the time needed. I also think that there is so much medical information that it can be difficult to get consensus among doctors and you are often give mistaken information. 
-1	I don't trust some doctors because they are on a higher pay grade and tend to have an eminence of superiority.  Don't get me wrong, some doctors are great, they seem to want to help.  To others I may feel like another cattle being strung along and they don't care if I end up in a dazzling meadow or at a slaughterhouse as long as they get their payment. In my situation (chronic rhinitis) I often have to asking prodding questions to really get any help on my issue.  Everything they have recommended hasn't helped at all, they say the cyst in my sinus doesn't matter, my jaw being realigned with palatal expander/braces doesn't matter, both these things seem like something worth investigating more, but they don't.  Sure I think they probably know better, but I don't count 100% on it.
-1	I generally trust my current doctor, and I think she's a lot more trustworthy than the ones I've seen before, and she always takes extra time to explain things to me and walk me through my health plan. However, I've only seen her a few times over the past couple of years, and I don't completely trust her yet. I guess I just have an ingrained distrust of doctors when it comes to prescribing medications due to previous negative experiences with them disregarding the side effects I was having and pushing medications on me that were not essential (such as birth control pills and certain sleeping pills).
1	He is a family doctor. He been In the family for twenty years. He is always right with his diagnosis and treats my family according he feels like a family member .
-1	I don't feel like my doctor understands what I'm trying to communicate sometimes. He wants to do some test instead of actually listening to me, or he ships me off to another doctor who only knows part of the story. I would trust my doctor more if I thought he was actually hearing what I'm saying and if he would not be so dismissive of my insights into my own health.
-1	I usually go to a clinic, so I never know which doctor or NP I will see. I like some of them, they go over everything with me. Some of them it seems like I only see for a minute, and then they leave the room before I can ask any questions.
1	I generally trust them when there is no incentive to skew the truth. Even in that case they aren't lying they just aren't giving the best solution. 
-1	I have no reason not to trust these people. I would also expect someone to trust me in my profession just the same.
-1	"At the moment my primary care physician is a nurses assistant, not an actual DR. thanks to my insurance.  She is kind of knowledgeable but at my last visit she had to ""Ask Dr. Google""  to answer one of my questions which not only worries me but is something I could do myself for free."
-1	I have a great general physician, but I typically like to research my conditions and then review options with my doctor before making a decision. If I disagree, I seek a second opinion. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. He's never done anything to upset me. He listens to me and is very patient. I have had to switch my children's doctor one time though. I did not agree with her many times and she hardly seemed to check out my kids, I did not trust her at all. 
-1	I feel that my primary care physician has a very heavy work load and sometimes may be in such a rush that she misses something. She missed by back pain that was actually a kidney stone, for example.
-1	My doctor has been a doc for over 25 years and has always given the best options available for what my ailment has been. I trust her whole heartedly 
-1	I trust him because he has given me good direction with my health. He is a little blunt so at times he has hurt my feelings. However, he is a good doctor and has given me good medical care for years. I just thinj he needs to work on his bedside manners. He has been my family doctor for years. I trust his judgement on medicines and whats best for my overall health. 
-1	My physician doesn't make a habit out of asking for unnecessary tests or making me pay more than I should for a service or diagnosis. I trust that the doctor is looking out for my best interests.
1	Well, I've only gone to my new PCP once but she really took her time to get to know me and my history.
-1	I trust him because he looks out for my well being, and if he prescribes something that I am not comfortable with after reading the side effects of reviews then he recommends or prescribes an alternative form of treatment
1	My doctor spends a good amount of time in the room with me, 15 to 20 minutes or more, talking with me about any issue that I am having. She listens to what I have to say and does what ever tests are needed with out hesitation. She also felt a lump in my breast that turned out to be breast cancer.
-1	My PCP has never steered me wrong. She doesn't take chances. She sends me for testing when she thinks there is something that does not look normal. She is very honest and doesn't sugar-coat anything for me. I appreciate her honesty very much.
1	I have had nothing but positive experiences with doctors. They are highly trained and knowledgeable in their subject, I have no reason to doubt them.
1	I trust my PCP because she has far more education than I do. She would never intentionally do anything that would cause me harm. I know that if something is wrong with me, she will figure out the best way to treat it.
-1	I am on the fence with doctors because I think to many of them have a god complex and have very little information on how diet can actually affect your health.
-1	I have a rare illness that my Physician had never heard of, so his choices in my care have not always been the right choices. I do see a specialist that I trust a bit more, but overall I am very discouraged with most of my healthcare providers due to their lack of knowledge or willingness to educate themselves on my conditions. 
-1	I donât go to the doctor often. I see doctors as well educated people, and their decisions and diagnoses are more times correct than not. If I have a feeling theyâre wrong, I would let them know. As for prescribing medicine, as far as I know and what I have seen, doctors prefer prescribing the more expensive medicines so they themselves profit off of it. In that regard, although they arenât being dishonest, they arenât disclosing all options either. 
-1	I have a nurse practitioner and trust her and doctors in general. However, I think it's important to educate ourselves on our condition and possible treatments. Doctors and care providers may overlook some possibilities. We have to keep in mind that they are seeing many patients and we have our own health, and maybe our family's, to look after.  
-1	"If the doctor is bad, it's likely that it would have been revealed by now to someone else. It's extremely unlikely that a doctor would be ""out to get me"" specifically. Furthermore, since I lack the necessary scientific knowledge to verify everything the doctor says, I have no real way to check what they say. Since it's unlikely that they're misleading me and attempting to verify them is impractical, there's little point in worrying about it. Of course, if someone does mislead me, I wouldn't hesitate to distrust them in particular."
-1	I've been going to my doctor for a few years, she has a good way of explaining things and listening to what I have to say. She answers questions thoroughly. I also checked her on the list of doctors who accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies and she doesn't accept those gifts.
1	I trust my primary care physician because his demeanor is very calm, friendly and because he is a good listener. He tends to be very patient, answers all of my questions and speaks with authority. When he has not been confident, he has sent me to a specialist rather than commit to a potentially inaccurate diagnosis.
-1	In general, the medical profession is run by corporations and pharmacy companies who are as interested in a profit as they are anything else.  Individual doctors and other medical personal may be more interested in a patient's care, but the institutions themselves are a different matter.  A government intervention is doing nothing to make it any better.
-1	For the most part I trust him.  I don't think by any means he would want ill for me but occasionally when nothing seems urgent it feels like his patient overload becomes more important then my concerns.  Also sometimes I wish he would give more thought into different treatment when I may not be comfortable with what he was suggesting. Seems like first idea and his idea is the only idea.
-1	unfortunately I have to say that most physicians I have seen firsthand didnât give me the most trusting feeling, although I can't say I wasn't cared for but I feel a lack on the care system. As mentioned before, most prescriptions are given based on symptoms and 'guesses' and not on facts, or exams. I do give attention and value to what my primarily physician says but I never see situations as a one way street so I do my research. And sincerely get disappointed if I look for help and medical guidance and am told that nothing is wrong without any testing done. 
1	I trust my doctor because they tell me what I need to hear versus what I may want to hear. Hearing those true facts allow me to make sure I am aware of the decisions that I choose to make. I believe it is important to gain the trust in the doctor, so they know what your background story may be. Most times it is best if they share their own story to make myself or the patient feel more comfortable. this allows me to open up more to them and tell them whats writing frequently. 
1	My doctor does not have any hesitation in telling me how it is with my health.  If I balk at doing something he is suggesting he will be very blunt on why it has to be done.  He has never steered me wrong, I trust what he says.
-1	The doctors I have visited seem like they judge me and I feel as they know something is wrong with me but won't tell me and they always have the same pity look they give me. I don't trust any doctors because I know they just want to get rid of me and they think of me as another patient (another number) in the system.
-1	I mostly trust my physician because they are a close family friend. They are usually pretty straightforward and honest with me.
-1	My doctor is a little impersonal so I dont distrust him but I dont trust him fully either, sometimes he very attentive and other times he is apathetic and doesnt give a care about me so its hard to decipher which day he is which.
-1	In general, I think physicians are well trained and probably know what they are talking about.  However, I rarely get a chance to see a physician for more than a few minutes once or twice a year.  There isn't really a chance to build a trusting relationship.  I think the way the health system is set up forces doctors to go for quantity instead of having the opportunity to build real relationships with their patients.  Trust takes time to be earned and I just haven't really had the time to build any with any doctor in years.
-1	In the past four years I have been given a misdiagnosis three times because doctors failed to ask the appropriate questions or perform a simple bloodtest.  I spent months in excruciating pain while doctors scratched their heads and did nothing but prescribe medications that did not help and in fact made me feel even worse while my fingers were literally dying.  I could get a shower without literally screaming and curling up in a fetal position afterward.  There is no painkiller that can help that level of pain.  I am quite certain that if they had bothered to check my thyroid levels that I would not have endured a level of misery that makes one question what quality of life is worth living.  I have no trust in the competence of doctors because most are apathetic due in large part to the healthcare system itself.
1	My primary is part of a medical group that is responsive and communicative. I find throughout my health needs they explain all tests, procedures and issues. If I have questions I can call any time. Plus they have an excellent online presence for appointments, access to records, payments etc. 
-1	I do not fully trust my primary care physician because they have such a busy and hectic job.  How could they possibly always be able to perform well under their stressful work conditions?  They see patients for such a short time and it's hard to think they could always be right about what condition a person has, and what drug will make them better.
-1	I feel that my primary care physician is concerned with my best interest.  However, it is difficult to totally trust them knowing the lobbying they receive from pharma companies.  I often wonder if I really need the medicine they prescribe or if they are receiving a kickback for it.  On the other hand, my PCP spends a lot of time answering my questions and explaining treatment options.  I do not feel pushed to take medicine I am uncomfortable with.  All in all, I trust my doctor and am not considering switching. I just wish the healthcare system overall was more transparent!
-1	My doctor seems rushed just to get me out the door so they can move on to the next person. When I need things explained to me they bring in a nurse or someone else to speak with me. When I call with questions it sometimes takes days to get back to me.
1	My primary care physician seems very thorough. I think he pays attention and he knows his stuff - he seems to know what he's talking about.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I always like to question my doctor though. Itâs part of my nature.
-1	"I have served in a medical sales capacity for more than 10 years and have seen doctors who recommend and even require certain patient services that will benefit them financially although they may not be the most medically necessary or advantageous service.  Medicine has become a ""business"" more than it used to be and managed care does not always allow the doctor to provide the best care, rather what is allowed."
-1	I have several friends in the medical profession and the horror stories they have told me, as well as the life or death situations some of my less healthy friends have had to suffer because of poor care at a hospital, has tainted my view of the profession. Medical Error. Overwork, Carelessness, Corporate Pressure, Ignorance. It's all a big problem. 
-1	If I don't understand something, I ask my doctor to explain it to me.   Afterwards, I usually follow up and research the issue more.   Rarely is my doctor incorrect in their explanations. In addition, they are able to provide referrals to good doctors (those respected in the community). My doctor also surrounds himself with competent staff.
1	In all of my recent doctor visits, the doctors have suggested minor preventative things I could perform to better my health, that were completely unrelated to the original visit's intention. It wasn't necessary, but they care in general to see less patients.
1	I come from a small community and there have been several times that myself or a family member has been in for one thing or another and it would not be uncommon for our Dr. to call the home phone or cell on his time off to see how we were doing and if something was not right he would meet you at hospital or even your home, all on his own time.
-1	My doctor seems to be on a timer. I don't feel he wants to spend any extra time because he has so many patients or whatever. The last time I saw him in November 2017, he more or less lectured me that I need to lose weight. My A1C was 7 so he appeared upset. I had a short visit and I'm scheduled to see him again in March of 2018. I may cancel the appointment.
-1	"Along with the strong development trend of the market economy, many social values have been changed: social relations, morals and morality are also reversed. For the medical industry, besides a number of achievements are very proud, a small part of the doctor insensitive to the pain of the patient, against the moral, contrary to conscience, doctrine, do ""stained ""The image of the noble profession of medicine has traditioned for many generations. So what is morality? What is yoga? What is the content of ethics? What are the causes of medical ethics? How to improve ethical issues in the health sector? These are urgent issues of the society today."
1	My primary care physician seems genuine and thoughtful. She listens to all  my questions and never seems to be in a rush. She seems thorough in her examination and is kind.
1	My doctor took the time to answer all my questions. My doctor followed up with me and sat down with me one on one for as long as it took for every concern. She is very kind and did not make me feel like I was burdening her. She called me and made sure I was okay after a procedure and made sure I did not have any other questions she could help answer. all in all she made me feel very comfortable. Even the nurses were very prompt in returning calls and making me feel like I was the only patient they had. I hope everyone has the same experiences I did during that difficult time. 
-1	I donât think some physicians are open enough to modern medicine or understand the muscles and skeletal systems in the body or how we can hold so much internally. Some are more open minded then others.
-1	I find that they are all about the bottom line. They often either ignore your complaints, don't take into consideration the HUMAN with feelings behind the symptoms, or worse, they go on a great zebra hunt when a horse is staring them in the face, more to cover their asses against malpractice than for the patient's welfare. If you are not attractive and/or young, healthcare declines.  I can figure out what is wrong with me faster on google than I can by going to the doctor and BE RIGHT.
1	I have known my primary care physician for a long time and he has always been honest with me. I have never had an incident where my doctor lead me wrong or caused something negative
1	Physicians are in their career for a reason and a lot of trust is involved when they are helping patients out. There is a relationship that builds
-1	"Normally, I would say that I trust my primary care physician, however, there are times where they've ""dropped the ball"" on important physical issues/experiences that I've encountered, elongating the amount of time it takes to receive treatment."
1	After a few problems with doctors ignoring my concerns (I spent years with a vitamin deficiency b/c the doc would order bloodwork and insisted it was all in my head) I found an extremely thorough doctor that listens to me. 
1	She takes her time with me. She listens to what I say and even to my suggestions for treatment  If she does not know something she gets more info for me. She is totally honest with me.
1	My doctor has been very helpful by working in conjunction with me to address any health issues that I have had. She listens to my concerns and understands that I am an involved patient. Because she listens to my input, I trust her to work with me toward responsible health goals.
1	They are passionate about what they do and took an oath to uphold a certain code to protect people in every way that they can.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I have been seeing this doctor for twenty-plus years. He always takes the time to explain things and ask questions to understand what is going on with me. I always get the proper treatment for whatever ails me.
1	the most doctors are very skilled and human, so in this way, all of them are very trustworthy and helpful to their patients, and i have complete and total trust on what they say
-1	I trust her because she trusts me. I feel that I can talk to her honestly, and I expect her to be blunt in return. Most recently, she was worried about my cholesterol level but I was reluctant to go on new meds. She agreed that I could try to bring it down with lifestyle changes, so she gave me some diet tips instead of a prescription. With changes in diet and exercise, I brought it down 53 points. 
-1	I have not had my current physician for a very long time and we are still getting to know one another and my multiple physical and mental conditions. We are still exploring traditional and non-traditional treatment methods to increase my quality of life.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they are very professional, experienced, and knowledgeable. They have never done anything detrimental to my health.  
1	I trust my physician because he is generally caring and I see him over do himself daily for his patients. He gives patients his work and personal phone number so he can be reached at anytime day or night. He's also really good about what tests he orders or doesnt order to find out the cause of whatever is going on. He also listens to each and every patient for as long as is needed. He doesn't stick to the every fifteen minute schedule he's set to.
-1	He seems to know what it right for me. I do not have any trouble understanding what advice he gives me.
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for more than 8 years. I have also had 2 major medical situations and he has guided me through out the processes. 
-1	"I mostly trust my doctor but sometimes I believe that doctors are only taught one way of thinking and therefore do not consider alternative treatments in all cases but rather use only drugs to ""fix"" issues."
1	I trust my doctor mainly because he has very good listening skills and is attentive to my needs and concerns. He is most easy to talk to and never attempts to talk over my head. Even though he is a young physician, I feel most comfortable with him. I do not usually get stressed out when I go to my physician. I can't say that I really look forward to getting and sick and needing my physician's care, but at the same time, I do not dread having to schedule a visit with him.
-1	"I do not have a primary care physician, however, I did have to go to a doctor recently (possible kidney stones). He was a good doctor who, although busy, took the time to listen to my concerns and symptoms while keeping a ""playful/positive"" attitude. He treated me as though I was perfectly competent in my descriptions/concerns and, while listening to me describe my symptoms, stated what possible things could be causing my symptoms, and finally what he thought it was most likely to be. He was genuinely concerned about my comfort (I was in extreme pain...but I was a champ) and wanted to make sure the pain levels would be decreased before I left the office. He sent me to another doctor for a CT scan and, after I explained I don't have health insurance, made sure that he found the best payment options/route for what I needed done as opposed to just charging me one set rate. I trusted his opinion and appreciated his compassion and humor. In general, this has been my experience with most doctors...busy, but compassionate."
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they have a degree in medicine, and has seen many others like me with similar issues in the past.
1	I have had my Doctor as my Primary Care for over 10 years and he is very open an honest with me and  very straight forward, he doesn't pretend just tells me straight and that what I like.
-1	It's rare I visit with a doctor that seems genuinely concerned or one that assumes his first diagnosis isn't correct. All seem to be THE expert. Some seem tired of the repetitiveness of their practice. And most seem to prescribe a specific, expensive drug, when there are other options available.
-1	Mostly I feel like I am just a number to them. They seem to always choose the most expensive procedures and treatments. A lot of medical professionals are arrogant and selfish.
1	My Primary care doctor has always been there for me when I have questions. I can communicate with her via email and she will see me if I really need to come in with almost no advance notice.  She explains things well and cares if I  am OK.
1	The methods implemented by my doctor to help me have always worked in the past. I have asked my doctor questions about why they wanted to be a doctor and what kind of education they have. Therefore, I know my doctor is passionate about their profession and wanting to help people. My doctor communicates with me promptly when I have a question or concern about my health. My doctor also has a good bedside manner, is always respectful, and does not make inappropriate comments. I know my doctor will be up front with me when I ask them difficult questions.
1	I didn't have a primary doctor for quite a while because I didn't think I really needed one.  I had to get a referral to see a neurologist, so I saw one recently for that.  She was so nice and made me feel very comfortable.  She compared some digestive issues that I'm having to problems that her daughter is having and gave me good advice on solving the problem. She seemed very down to earth and trustworthy.
-1	When it comes to doctors in general I will trust their ability to identify a problem. What I do not trust is the ability to prescribe a solution to a problem.  Most doctors solution to most problems is by prescribing a drug even when a problem can be resolved with simple diet and exercise. This is the main reason why I will not trust what the doctor prescribes  but will trust his diagnosis.
-1	Are usually trust my doctors about 80% you can truly trust them 100% because some doctors do make mistakes and thatâs why itâs always a good to always ask a lot of questions and if you have any doubts get a second
1	Before I choose a physician or hospital that I would go to ER visit I always check the reviews and I always do my research and up to now I've had great confidence with all the positions are hospitals that I have chosen
-1	My primary care physician has many many other patients and very little time, is constrained from making definitive statements, and is affected by the pharmaceutical companies they receive benefits from, their insurance, my insurance, and their own social personal and religious biases.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing him for many many years and he is very honest and helpful. He doesn't do unnecessary procedures or tests.
1	My Primary care doctor spends time with me and answers all my questions, tells me if I need to be concerned about something and doesn't waste my time if I don't. I have asked for him on the phone and he answers my calls and emails promptly if I have concerns.
1	I generally trust my doctor as they have gone to medical school and see many things that make it so they learn a great deal. At the same time I do like to look into things myself. I'm not one that likes to take medications that have side effects and care a great deal about knowing what I'm dealing with medically.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he is caring and concern about my health throughout the years. He also does an exceptional job taking care of his patients and very loyal to them.
1	I trust my primary care physician. She is empathetic, thorough, and a great communicator. She always takes the time to thoroughly explain things. I never feel like she is in a rush.
-1	I don't trust doctors because I think they put a band-aid on the problem instead of solution trying to fix the problem. For example, doctors over-prescribing opioids to relieve pain.  
1	She is very sincere and caring. She is very knowledgeable and sensible. I feel like she does this job because she genuine enjoys taking care of people and she is very good at it
-1	Haven't had all that many interactions with primary care doctors but they're usually rushed and seem more about getting through the interaction than anything else. Jaded, too.
-1	I dont really have much of an option to not trust my doctor. If i didn't trust my doctor, then i need to find one that i can. Besides that, i feel that they are the expert in their field just as i am an expert in my field. They should know what they are talking about and if they dont, they should either tell me they dont, or find someone that does.
-1	I haven't seen my primary care doctor all that often and usually when I do it's for pretty straight for things such as a broken arm or a physical. In other words, it's hard for me to quantify my trust in my doctor because I've never been put in a situation where trust can be questioned.
-1	"I do not trust my doctors because I have asked them simple questions sometimes and they give me the most basic answer so they don't have to waste their time answering me properly. Example, I asked what type of blood I am and the response I got was: ""Oh, now the type of blood is no longer as easy as a letter. It's complicated. It's a number of letters and numbers. Don't worry about that."" Also, my doctor put me on the wrong treatment once and it lasted for months. "
1	My family has used our primary care doctor for many years and he has always done a great job in treating us.  He has never given us any reason to feel like he doesn't have our best care as a priority and for that we have complete faith and trust in him.  He's never done us wrong.
-1	I think that most doctors are very trustworthy and careful about there jobs and recommendations.  There are always people that might not care about their jobs as much in any area of business.
-1	Nobody knows me or my body better than me. No degree or amount of years in school can make anybody the person who knows me better.
-1	I Trust them because I go there and they make me feel good about everything and they take the best care of me 
1	I trust my doctor because they have my best interests at heart because they know what is best for me.  The doctor tells me what I need to do because they care about me and my needs.  My doctor is very caring and they treat me correctly and very professionally.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has good advice and he follows up with me when I take my prescriptions.
-1	Because I been hearing a lot of stuff about doctors nowadays and I really don't like doctors and they make me nervous 
1	My doctor has been my doctor for 16 years and he has never told me wrong. I feel as if he cares about me. 
-1	Doctors are in the business of making money like everyone else. Sometimes, you'll get one that is more interested in the bottom line than in actually treating a patient. 
-1	I trust my health care provider to keep me looking and feeling healthy and give me great advice on my body and what I can do to improve 
-1	You can never trust a doctor 100%. Most times they given you medicine you don't need or sometimes they can Ms diagnose you
-1	My relationship with my doctor has really changed over the 15 years I have been going to him.  When I started seeing him he was a family practitioner and I trusted him a lot more.  Now he wants to specialize in geriatric medicine and he doesn't really seem interested in my primary care needs.  I am in the process of finding a new doctor but I haven't found one yet.
-1	They are always looking out for my health and making sure everything is good and I don't have any problems at all
-1	I don't have a primary care physician at the moment, but if/when I get one, I'll judge him based on his expertise, reputation, my own knowledge and judgment and first impressions.
-1	Sometimes it seems like doctors are mechanics, trumping up small issues to make you spend countless money. 
1	I have been treating with my doctor for more than 10 years. Everything he tells me or recommends has helped my overall health.
-1	In trust my physician for the most part, and I say that because although he is a doctor or what not, he does not have all of the answers I may be seeking about a certain condition of how I am feeling.
-1	I trust them because they are usually accurate that's why. And they will or will not give you the medical attention you need
-1	Well they are in the buisness of making money my health to me is not that important to them because if they could tell me everything to do to stay well then i would not need them
1	I trust my doctor because I know they aren't going to tell me wrong they have a phd so I know they Aren't going to tell me wrong 
-1	I don't trust physicians,They are known to make mistakes thayt can endanger lives. They can give wrong medicine.
-1	Doctors Care more about getting paid then helping or getting to the next patient most doctors don't do all that they know they can do for you 
-1	in general, I prefer to do my own research. Doctors are only humans and can make mistakes and be miseducated just as anybody else could. I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on anybody for anything frankly.
1	everytime i go there its important and i get results from them that is very acurate and correct i only go to my physician if i nneed to
-1	Well, I just started to see this new doctor so right now, I have given her all of my old medical records and she was able to get me back on my medications. 
1	I will always trust her because she helps me manage my diabetes so well and she keeps me from ending up in the emergency room by helping me keep my blood sugars under control
1	most doctors for the most part tell you up front what your health is like but it is up to the induvial to listen to the doctor and door what is needed to improve there health
1	My nephrologist gives me 1000% because she knows that I am not afraid to take my illness head on. She has been my doctor for 20 years now. She is caring, sympathetic, understanding, kind and just a fantastic human being. I am very blessed to have her on my angel team. She is always upfront and honest.
-1	I trust the doctors but as any humans , they are imperfect. As a result i took his advice with some degree of caution and sometimes ask a second opinion with another doctor
-1	I believe my doctor has my best interests in mind. He listens to my ideas and mulls them over thoughtfully, sometimes challenging my logic but most often agreeing with me. we decide on courses of action together, taking in my mind my needs and objections. we have built trust together in this way.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has been my physician for ten years and I will not have it any way.  He make sure I am good and whatever I problem I have he addresses the problem with the upmost reapect

-1	I trust that my primary care physician is providing me with all of the information that I need in order to get proper care for my health condition. 
1	I trust my doctor because she is open honest by telling me both the good and the bad in all thongs we discuss about my health. 
-1	I don't particularly care for my doctor and have been looking for a new doctor. She doesn't seem to take any issues seriously and in the past this attitude has caused me to nearly miss a serious condition.  
-1	I distrust in in part because I feel that he is looking out for the facility rather than for the patient. It takes longer to get the real test that you need, because they want the doctors to try other things first.
-1	I am not the type of person that ever completely trust someone. Doctors are humans as well. They view things with the common eye and have to give prognosis. There are a lot of conditions that exist so I will always second guess what I'm being told.
1	I trust my primary care physician because because she is imformative when it comes to my over all health,because i can tell she cares about her patients and she makes sure i follow up on everthing i have to do to stay healthy, she explains in full details about my meds, easy to talk to thats why i trust her as my primary care physician

-1	I have a longtime relationship with my physician, she is caring, answers all my questions, spend a good amount of time addressing my concerns, although very busy she is thorough.
1	Doctor are suppose to take care of their patients as if they were their children, and try to help them as much as they can, I would want a Doctor to do all he can to help me get better and not have to keep coming back for the same problem over and over.
-1	I've been with my PCP since I was a teenager and she is my mother's doctor. Sometimes I feel like not all the right questions are asked by the PA, but the actual doctor in the office is usually pretty thorough
-1	McCoy costs classic dO didn't call drops Church's a shift discuss does Alex flex for Eric Alex emits ask us will mark hasn't DJs Emma anonymous donor I am so happy to hear that you are 3
-1	I trust my doctor but then I don't because I don't feel like they are giving me all the help I need at times but then again they do help at least keep me going in life with all my medical problems that I have right now but I feel like there is more they could do to help me so that's why I don't kinda trust them it's like they are just rushing through  patients at time to get over work and not actually looking to really help
1	I trust my primary care physician because they only can give you test results and treat you for the problem, and if you don't trust them you can get a second opinion,
-1	I have trust in my primary physician to a degree because no doctor deserves total trust. You know your body and sometimes you have to go with your own gut feeling.

-1	I trust them because I've been going to them for years and no everything about me that I have been struggling
-1	i trust him because i depend on him to tell me all the right things and to diagnosed me right so i can get the proper treatment
-1	Even though doctors are trained and have a plethora of knowledge, your body knows what's best. Trust your gut feeling, pray for wisdom, research information and listen to what your body is telling you.
1	To me no matter what position a person holds it be wise to weigh the trust and distrust. It depends on if I've known my doctor for more than a year to genuinely trust her.
1	MY DOCTOR IS ALL OF THE ABOVE. I HAVE A NICE RE PORE WITH MY DOCTOR AND THE STAFF, WHERE HIS OFFICE IS LOCATED!!
1	She always listens to my questions and concerns without making me sound totally ignorant or a bother to her
-1	in most cases my doctor has my best interest in mind, but there are times I think she group  all of her patient all together instead of going indept
1	Doctor hasn't done anything or given me a reason not to trust him. He is genuinely concerned about my health. He makes sure I know every aspect of what is going on and how to make things better if need be. 
-1	I find in hard to trust doctors because a lot of people become doctors for the wrong reason instead of becoming one to help people they become doctors because it's a high paying job.
-1	I'm very middle of the road on this because of my own personal experiences. Ive never been mislead by a doctor but I do know people who believe they have, including close family members. So as with anything involving humans I don't completely put my faith in it.
1	My primary care physician has never given me reason to distrust him and therefore I trust him very much. He has always given me all the options that I have for whatever medical conditions I am facing. 
-1	I am new to my primary doctor he seem well informed of my chronic condition and orders test appropriately, responds to my questions in timely manner. 
-1	I kinda don't trust my eye care professional doctor that much. He never told me the side effects of my medicine or even my condition to what was wrong with my eye. He seems to only care if he gets paid. He sometimes seems rude also. Having me wait when he is doing absolutely nothing and conversing with nurses about nonsense when everyone besides him has a schedule.
-1	I have been with her for years she allows me to feel comfortable discussing my problems and tries to give solutions by referring me to specialists

-1	My doctor has sent me home with prescriptions for a cold when I was bent over in stomach pain. I went to the ER and the prescriptions she sent me could have made my stomach (gastritis) even worse.

-1	I plan on changing my doctor. He is very arrogant and uncaring. He never listens to me and when he does it's with an nonchalant attitude. For these reasons I do not trust his diagnosis or treatments unless I receive a second opinion.
-1	My doctor has always been honest with me and had my best interest at heart.  Se has never recommended anything or any tests that were not necessary
-1	I do not have a personal opinion on how trustworthy my primary is. I assume if they would like to continue in their profession, then they will obviously be trustworthy. Then again this is America haha
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for about 10 years now, I have full and complete trust in him.  He is very proactive with my health and he does not always recommend using medicine.  
-1	He has been forthcoming on everything i need to know about my condition and what i need to do to take care of it.
1	I trust my physician because of my experience with her. I always have the final decision about my own care.
-1	I trust doctors to an extent. Not too much though. They are in business to make a profit at any cost!

-1	You  can't  put  trust  in  anybody  to  a certain  point  ,  you  can  weigh  the  many  options  out,  but  you have  to make the  best  choice   for  you
-1	I do not trust physicians in general because I believe that they are mostly out to make money and keep people on drugs.

-1	I have faith i God and i trust that God will lead me to best physician for me who knows my condition if and or when i have one. I believe that dr.will be completely effecient in treatment care for me. Im optimistic snd prayerful
-1	Doctors always try to rush, don't actually make sure you're all the way okay until you come in with a disease, and go to what they tell others when telling you how something happened and dismiss your actual lifestyle.
-1	I dont distrust my doctor i just always keep in the back.of my head that my doctor is only human and can make mistakes
1	He has always been very thorough and attentive as well as honest. He takes his time during my appointments and always follows up with me about my test results.
-1	I think my doctor schedules more patients than she should which causes appointment times with the doctor to be rushed and short and not enough information is given to me or options discussed
1	I trust my doctor because he has knowledge that I don't have concerning my health issues. I trust my doctor because she went to school to study about health issues that effect us.
1	HE is very detailed and asks lots of questions and takes his time to answer each question and provide concise answers
1	they are professional doctor have been to a college and know about the human. theyexpience on a regular basic. bt we know for a fact that god know the human body than we do. men dont have knowledge all knowledge from our creator and our lord jesus christ
-1	I don't distrust doctors I'm an optimist and.like to.loom at the bright side of things . knowing that they are given the knowledge to perform their job
-1	My doctor spends a lot of time with each and every one of her patients. She takes time to get to know them and socialize with them and to explain options and treatments 
-1	I think medical caregivers, doctors, and nurses are just in it for the money. A lot of them don't care about their patients. You become a number.
-1	I don't trust no doctor at all. Some diagnosis you wrong. Some don't even no whats wrong with you. They just try to solve your problem 
1	My doctor is trustworthy and has helped me with many issues with my health. I feel very comfortable speaking openly to my doctor when it comes to any new health concerns. 
-1	I trust my doctor because we communicate effectively with each other. If we don't communicate what is going on or on all the different treatments available than I would not have as much trust as I do today.
-1	They just leave me alone for hours then they get mad when you ask questions . They get angry and rush you out.
-1	Not all doctors Are authentic in their reasons for going into a helping profession and are money focused 
1	I trust doctors because they are helpful and reliable in helping patient treat thaie ailment and diseases.
-1	I don't fully trust my primary doctor because of a bad circumstance we been through before where I went to him with some issues I was having and he kept brushing me off for a year. In the end it was something serious.
-1	Doctors see so many patients they forget the experience is new for you, even though it may be their hundredth experience. Even though a lot of them may mean well, I would not put too much trust in their decisions because they have to answer to insurance companies as well.
-1	I feel that some doctors are more into trying to get you out of the office after running up your medical bills than they are into helping patients to get better. 
1	I trust my dr with my primary care and trust him in my medical decisions because he is a honest and trustworthy dr. I wouldn't want another dr
1	One of the major reason why I trust my primary care physician is because she has being our family doctor for years and treats us so well with kindness and strong hand atimes when necessary

-1	I semi-trusted my old doctor, because she is well known. I live in a small town, she is bascally everyone's doctor including my mother. I currently do not have insurance so I haven't used her as my doctor for yrs now, but I would use her again. 
-1	I don't trust anybody & thats basically it. I have had enough terrible experiences in the past with people on a whole. Everybody is all for themselves nowadays & they will only treat you nice because it is their job & they are getting paid for it. Majority of the time i think thats what it is. I do believe there are a few that actually care though but they are scarce.
-1	I haven't had any reason not to trust my doctor. I have been traveling with the same physician for a number of years and he has been open and honest do fat
1	I trust my doctor I've had her for 5 years she's usually straight forward with me about my health and wellbeing 
-1	I trust my primary care doctor because of the way that talk to me and ask me if I understand what I need to do and if I am satisfied about the results of my health. 
-1	I do not really trust or distruct my primary care physician because they can only be in it for the money
1	She is thorough open and honest.  She believes in God and listens to me when I talk. She responds to my questions and never seems rushed 
1	My doctor talks to me more than he examines me and looks at test results.  He explains absolutely everything; even with pictures when I don't understand.  He insists that any problems I experience are related to my lifestyle.  He keeps  me on a low fat diet, limited alcohol, and a regular sleep schedule.  The only medication he gives me is for my eczema and sleeping pills that I should only take occasionally.  I'm instructed to return to him if I need to take the sleeping pills more than occasionally.  He gave me a nighttime routine that should help me get to sleep.  Long conversations and reviewing my blood pressure history, he discovered that my blood pressure is up only when I don't get enough sleep; so rather than blood pressure medication he wants me to get enough sleep.  
1	My doctor takes the time to listen intently to my concerns and isn't afraid to say that she needs to do more research. She's very detailed and knows a lots about medical researches 
1	Because he is experienced at his profession and also he knows what he is doing and also he knows how to treat his patients 
1	she makes sure I take care of my self by making sure I see my specialist andd double checking what they say
1	Some things i can trust about physicians but mostly not everything is to be believed. Doctors give u things to suppress ilnesses but not get rid of it. Its all about keeping us sick. So no I dont trust doctors. I trust in the Lord Jesus Christ only! God of Abraham, Isaac and Joseph.
1	She is mindful of my family history and as such makes sure she keeps a check on potential diseases or disorders I may inherit.
-1	I trust my doctor because she has never made any decision that have harmed me. They have all been for the best. 
-1	I do not have insurance and cannot afford a Primary care physician. I do not trust physcians because they have too many patients to provide me special attention
-1	I trust my primary doctor because he takes the time out to talk to and get to know each patient and ask questions that you can't answer with yes or no
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part because gives complete exam and extra test if needed to make I am not experiencing any other health problems
-1	I feel some doctors don't know what there doing. I would like someone who is experienced or at least able to explain to me what i am taking

-1	I trust my physician because she always looks at me when communicating and she always asks questions about how I'm feeling.  I feel that she gives me a sense of trust and I could tell her anything.  She is a very thorough and caring physician. 
1	I feel like since my doctors have gone to medical school, they're no dummies. I have a good report with my doctors to where they give me the good and the bad. 
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a long time and he is very in tuned to my needs and is constantly learned more about medical needs.

1	My primary physician is extremely thorough. When I go in for office visits I feel like I am the only patient seen that day. The doctor constantly ask if I have any other questions or concerns and takes time to answer me
1	I trust my primary care physician because he explains to me exactly what is going on and gives me his best medical advice 
-1	Although I may respect and trust my doctor's opinion, I also have into account the limited amount of time he has with me, and the fact that I am an individual and not everything will work the same for everyone. While he has the ability to be medically informed, I know my own body and sometimes doctor fail to listen to their patients. I make independent inquiries and do my own research about medications prescribed and won't hesitate to stop taking a medication that is giving me undesirable effects/reactions.
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for almost 20 years. I have been fairly healthy all this time and has been good with recommendations when i have had health issues.
1	The reasons why I trust and distrust them a little because health care for profit can get in the way
-1	doctors are human and make mistakes. they are capable of misdiagnosing conditions, prescribing the wrong medicaions. they use staff that overbook patients so that you don't see a doctor. they over prescribe medications ,they push samples that you don't want to try because big pharma gives them perks for doing this practice whether the medication is right for you or not.
-1	Sometimes doctors aren't always honest with you. Even when something as simple as a cold they can give you medicine that's not necessary. Some doctors do actually have the time to make sure you are fine with what they are giving you to help you heal
-1	Overall I do trust what the medical provider says is true and reflects the best course of treatment needed.  \Than on the other hand I do think that because of insurance cost that some treatment options are delayed or not mentioned at all to cut cost.
1	Because he always seen to know how to treat any illness, or problem that I have, and since I have been seeing my doctor he have never been wrong about any of my health problems that I have had.
1	I trust my PCP because she never rushes during patient visits.  She goes into detail about any test results and she asks lots of questions about my health.  When I meet with her, I feel comfortable discussing anything that may concern me and I feel confident that she will provide me with the best answer and advice that would benefit me.
1	I always trust my doctor she has never turned me in the wrong direction always explains things and has got my health under control
-1	Idk you can't always trust somebody anyone could be lying no matter who the person you will never know what they are thinking in their head

1	I trust my primary care doctor because I am best friends with them and if they lie to me they will get in trouble.
1	I trust my doctor because he does not hesitate to tell me when I am doing something wrong and the risk of doing that and he will also tell me what I am doing right and praise me.
1	I have a doctor that actually cares about people. The entire practice cares about doing what's best for the patient and not what's going to be the most profitable or the easiest option.
1	I trust my doctor because they are well studied in the medical field for treating me and providing prescriptions.They have a lot at risk if they don't provide the right information.
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for a number of year and he has provided excellent care.  He is not quick to to put me on drugs.  Uses other alternative prior to using drugs to remedy ailments.

-1	Who Sunil Endo shul think to do you  think homophobic to do check bunko stay stuff tho do dunno dunno syrup yup dunno affecting full full full full
-1	I understand that doctors go to school and years of experience but sometimes they can still be wrong. So I do not put my trust in doctors but I put my trust in God.
-1	I don't she would tell you just anything for money. Alot of Dr's have had problems for just giving any information. She was highly recommended , so I think she gives good information. She explains everything . Her assistant is very thorough too. They are up to-date on new medications and procedures. She hasn't given a reason for distrust.
-1	I don't trust anyone I don't know. Now if they were family and I knew them well then yeah. But anyone I don't know 
-1	I think people should have trust in doctors because they went to school for their practices. O have full trust in my primary care physicians

1	I have been knowing him for awhile. He has a very great understanding of everything medical, and he has a great bedside manner.

1	I trust my doctor because he has been in my life since I was a baby. He's been a family doctor to my family for years and we all love him as if he is apart of our family. 
-1	It seems that doctors rarely truly listen. They think they know everything and they should never be second guessed even though the field of medicine is still growing and learning and the physician didn't seem like they listened in the first place (but they know). Usually whenever I have a question they never answer it satisfactorily and without taking any tests and/or additional tests (for questions about my health that would require additional tests that no physician would know otherwise).
1	I trust my physician because she seems very sincere when were are discussing my health. She listens and does not make me feel like I am paranoid.

-1	I feel that my doctor does all that he can with my health care, I just don't completely trust any of them.
-1	I feel like sometimes my doctor does things that i don't like and I wish they would come to me and go over it with me more.
1	He is takes time to explain my care plan and why certain test are necessary  he he is attentive a compassionate

1	I've been with my doctor for so long I just trust her word and care and believe she would give me the best options
1	There are numerous reasons why I trust my primary care physician. The main reason why I trust my doctor is because she's always been looking out for me. She's never stood me wrong or gave me a bad vibe. 
-1	Some doctors give misleading advice, so my trust in doctors are not that high. But I've rarely been to a doctor so I don't know by personal experience.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for a couple years and she has never steered me wrong. I believe she has my best interest along with her other patients best interest in mind. 
-1	I trust my doctor because of the signs and the symptoms I be having but distrust when it comes to some medications I'm supposed to be taking with harmful side effects
-1	Doctors only care about paying off their student loans and when that is done getting as much money as they can to justify suffering through all that crap in their twenties. Nowadays all of the caring, bedside manner, and respect I have gotten comes from nurses. You barely see your doctor when you are hospitalized and when my mom was dying, it was the nurses who called to tell me, who sat with me after she died and helped me. The only thing the doctor on call did was pronounce her dead and run out of the door.
1	I have been using him for years and trust his opinion. He is a very smart doctor and gives personal care.
-1	I trust my doctor but I always research the decision, the medicine and or treatment plans myself. In addition, I read my bodies feelings.
1	They have always seemed to care about my needs and seem to be very knowledgeable. They spend as much time with me as needed. They have also never guided me wrong yet.
1	I have seen my primary care physician for many years now. She has taken the time to get to know me personally and builds on this each visit. She offer medical advice as she would give to her own family
-1	I trust my dr. But I just feel that sometimes you need a second opinion which i find nothing wrong with that.
-1	my primary care physician  is honest can do the things that i asked for them to do also trustworthy with me.

1	I just my doctor because he had been my doctor for years. I have never had a bad experience. He has been very honest with me on everything.
-1	They know what they are doing and how to make things better. It's helpfully to know what's going on in your body
-1	doctors are usually trustworthy because they are worried of lawsuits of being disbarred.  most are good at their jobs also
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she does what's best for me, helps me feel safe, and tells me everything.
1	My MD has a proven record of being a phenomenal physician. My MD has been in the medical field for many years going for people from generation to the next generation. 
1	Doctors knows best. They are to be trusted at all times. Doctors knows the human body and knows what to provide 
1	She's always explained to me whatever she's doing in my treatment, and she's never given me any reason not to trust her
1	I have a long and trusting relationship with my doctor, who treats me with respect and factors in my demographics regarding decisions. She is thorough and caring and knowledgeable. We make decisions jointly as partners, with my doctor supplying all the technical information for me to make informed decisions. 
-1	I don't know if physicians as a group necessarily know or care about giving their patients the best care.
-1	Doctors cut corners. I know because I am one, and I have done so. So I wouldn't be surprised if my physician made mistakes because of that. 
1	I trust my doctor because he was there when I was born and is very trusted by my parents. He has taken good care of my siblings and is very kind. 
-1	Some doctor's are in it for the money and some doctors really do care. I believe insurance has a lot to do with it to.  I feel doctors, don't like dealing with uncovered patients.  I believe if we had universal insurance, Doctor's would be more understanding, if there wasn't a price tag attached to every person.  If every Doctor could look at every person, the same, and treat each person accordingly healthcare would be in a better light. I think the health care field needs to have guidelines securely in place pertaining to ethic's and morals.  I think it would make a great differences.
-1	Cool place travel Work plies greatest fits more money more problem  can I can cool sweet just trust ruggr treat
1	Very competent. Annual physicals are conversational regarding my overall health. This includes my physical assessment, lifestyle, diet, exercise, etc.
-1	Because a doctor can tell you that have one diagnosis and it be the total opposite to what you really have. Fix the symptoms not the diagnosis
-1	Nothing is gonna go so bad. Don't worry about a thing because every little thing is gonna be alright
-1	I trust him as he studied medicine and knows better in that aspect but on the other hand when it comes to prescribing medicine I feel like doctors have the pressure to use certain medicine
-1	Physicians seem to task the easiest route when it comes to providing healthcare. They come in issue a diagnosis and return back to their lives.

I get my flu shot every year and have saved money for over the counter cold medicine. I my pneumonia shots to stay out of the emergency room. Now my medical records are digital so I don't have repeated test all to keep cost down doing my part to achieve affordable health care.

I almost lost trust in them when they did not send one of my important documents over to my school, but then we kept calling the office until they sent this. I really do not know if you are reading this but if you are then know in a game of 1 on 1 basketball you cannot gaurd me.
1	I have been going to my primary care doctor a long time and usually what she recommends turns out to be very helpful.
-1	In American society, doctors are too easily swayed but money. I don't trust them to provide me with the care I need if I don't have insurance or the amount of money that want. It seems so odd that we have to buy our health, like the common man is owned but the powers that be. 
-1	I think many physicians are conditioned to think and behave a certain way, whether that stems from training or peer influence and sometimes cannot be ooen to seing beyond that field of view which can be a detriment to patient care as well as the representation of the medical field as a whole.
1	They listen well; will try various treatments starting with least to most intense. They make note of what I tell them and make adjustments accordingly.

My doctor has always answered my questions to my satisfaction and fully explained my issues. When my doctor thought that I needed a second opinion there was a quick referral."
-1	Make sure to ask questions and weight out you options your doctor can only go off of what you feel and what they see is not the only thing they can go off of treating you so make sure to be open and speak how you feel.
-1	I don't believe a lot of drs continue to study about new medicines and treatments that are available.  It is difficult to have faith in someone when that is the case.  Not only that, how do you really know you dr is a good one?
-1	well sometime they have best heart for me and sometime I  feel like they don't when I feel he or she is giving the wrong information
-1	They really don't take the time to talk with me nor make me feel like my needs and concerns are being heard.
-1	I have somewhat trust in my primary care physician.  However, I've only seen him once in two years.  The process now is to see a physician assistant rather than the doctor.

-1	"I don't think any doctor or physician is out to like to me or be dishonest. They wouldn't have chosen the profession if they didn't want to genuinely help people. The money is good, but the time investment is huge. Sure they may prescribe me a particular medicine to get ""kickbacks"" or something, but I feel they are fairly trustworthy."
1	I TRUST THE PCP SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY DO BE RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME BUT NOT ALWAYS ALL THE TIME  SOMETIMES THEY ARE MISLEADING 
-1	There are good people and try to do the best they can to assist you and others with there needs and make sure you are happy with the outcome

I also think most doctors are conscientious about their work with their patients and sincerely care about their well-being, even if they are subject to regular human biases. Personally, though, I hate going to doctors and actively avoid them, because I am an extremely private person and don't want to share personal and sensitive information about myself, or to be physically examined. For this reason, and because I am generally well-educated myself, I strongly prefer to avoid doctors and make personal health decisions on my own whenever possible."

Additionally, she makes me feel welcome and less nervous when entering her office. She'll make sure that not only my physical health is in shape, but also my mental health because I have a history of depression. She is a really good doctor.
1	She's personable and tells me of different ways to handle any diagnosis that she gives me: sinuses, etc.

-1	As stated in the letter of intent, the NHMFL offers the capability to measure actinide materials under unique conditions. Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples. 
1	They are not perfect and can make mistakes. A second and third opinion is best. My goal is not to say anything about the other doctors and see if each says the same thing.
-1	Dr Barbie seems competent for the most part but sometimes she ignores information that I give her because it's inconvenient. Once I persist she usually comes through but why do I have to justify legitimate concerns?  If I had any doctors that weren't as arrogant, I'd change, but I haven't. At least, she prescribes what I need instead of forcing me to stair step through options that don't work
-1	The only reason why I have some distrust in my physician is because she is quick to prescribe medications sometimes and isn't the best at explaining all the side effects and that makes me not trust her to the highest extent. She is pretty good overall thats the only issue I have with her. 
1	I trust my doctor or physician because they know there jilob that's what they study for and that's what there a profession in so they most likey know what there doing 
-1	I trust my doctor some what but over all my doctor always made sure I had the best care that will help me live longer.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they are in the profession for a time being and they would know best.  They would provide the best services possible to meet my needs and based on the their experience the can provide the appropriate type of medication etc.
1	The doctor/patient relationship (e.g., trust-building) is very important to the health community as a whole.
-1	I have more than one doctor. Some are more thorough than others while some are less conscious of the fact that I can understand my medical condition better when they fully explain things to me regarding treatment. I trust all of my doctors judgment, but am the kind of patient who likes to do my own homework.
1	I don't have any specific reason why I trust or distrust my primary doctor because I'd never had any reasons at all. I'd never had any doubts about my doctor. 
-1	I trust doctors cause they know what may or may not be wrong with me and how to fix it. But doctors are expensive especially if you don't have insurance to cover the medical bills. I myself may not go because of the expenses.
-1	the reason why I trust my doctor is because he is always explaining  my health and wellbeing very clearly to me.
-1	I don't trust or distrust doctors.  It depends on the situation if I feel like I can believe what they are telling me. 
1	I trust my doctor becauseâ I know without any doubt in my mind he knows what he is doing and I trust him to be my doctor because I know he cares for me.

-1	I trust them because their doctors for a reason & that's their job but then sometimes I don't trust them because some doctors just care for the money & not the people that need help.
1	I fully trust my primary physician. He has been treating me since I was a teenager.  He is very much concerned about my overall health and he displays it every time I visit him.  He makes sure that I am up to date on all of my annual and routine tests and evaluations. 
-1	They are petitioned by pharmaceutical companies to pimp drugs. They don't give you solutions outside of giving you lots of drugs.
1	I rust my primary care physician because I have always received sound medical care, and advice.  The care I have received have made my health better.
1	My primary doctor is great and the office workers are fantastic. Any time I have a problem I can always call and they help me 
1	I really like my doctor. She takes the time out of her day to explain all my options to me, go over results with me and explains every step we need to take to move forward. She is smart and patient
1	I trust that they will make the right decision and give me options and reasons as to why. if you can't trust them to do so who can you trust
-1	My doctor is kind and knowledgeable but sometimes rushes me out if she has lots of appointments on any given day.
1	My PC is through, clear on treatment, listens and works in partnership with me in controlling and treating my medical condition(s)
-1	There is two things that I think that you need to fine find that what's love and what's things thing are going we need to help 
1	...he is young, discusses his research findings & current opinions, not his personal ones, seeks my input, answers my questions and solicits options, recites what he is documenting, shares printouts w/me of what he has documented & discusses OUR plans. However, he does rely on computers more than I prefer & at times, selections within the computer are not available to address my actual concerns; for example, pain in forearm-nurse only found elbow pain in computer so entered that-PCP discussed elbow pain-redirected to discuss pain in forearm-he kept discussing elbow pain so offered options for that-I declined option for elbow pain & redirected discussion to pain in forearm to no avail, asked perhaps muscle?-ignored/dismissed/discounted? documented tennis elbow & that I declined tennis elbow splint which I did...oh well, another appointment next month to address pain in forearm, partially researched it, found muscle termed brachial-radialis (sp), more to do so am prepared for discussion on next appointment, takes a team to 'git 'er did'! Oh, pain in forearm was only one of other concerns for office visit (monthly weight loss management regime f/u, feeling of something in throat when swallowing, unlike history of swollen tonsils (US ordered), recent pain in forearm when lifting heavy objects). Thank you ~
-1	I have had a long relationship with  of my doctors. I can depend on them to answer all my questions and give me their honest opinion 
1	I have two physicians who I see.  Because I'm in good health (no major health issues) I feel quite comfortable with discussions I have regarding my maintaining my health and with regard to any issues that might effect my health.  I try to keep active and maintain a healthy lifestyle so there isn't much I would not trust them about.
-1	We I go to the doctors I can say I trust in the most of the time especially if they are experience doctors
-1	I don't trust primary care physicians because I don't know if they know what they prescribing to me 
1	I trust my doctor because she is smart she has her degrees. She's great at explaining things to me and she really cares about my health.
-1	I trust my physician to a fault; she let's me know what I need to do, but sometimes I feel like she doesn't really get me; on the other hand, whenever I need a referral or a document that has to be sent somewhere, she never hesitates to make it happen.
1	I trust my doctor because my doctor have my best intense at heart an will not recommend anything that is bad for me or anything that I will regret in the future

-1	My doctor has always been there for me. She tells me what is wrong(if there is anything wrong) and answers all my worrying questions.
-1	i trust some doctors. Not all doctors. everybody is not honest and trustworthy. Some nurses are very nice but not all
-1	I trust my medical physician in suggesting good medical treatments for me and I believe that my medical physician is capable of successfully treating any illnesses I may encounter. 
-1	 I do not completely trust my primary physician because he does not listen to me well enough. He is quick to assert his opinion and kind of ignores mine since I am less knowledgeable.
1	Complete trust in my doctors because they are truthful they explain how my medicines work and if I have any kind of questions regarding my medicine treatments I always give them a call and they always tell me how the medicine work what are the effects of the medicine
1	I trust my doctor because he's an excellent healthcare provider. He has always been honest, open and trustworthy. He also has a good bedside manner. My doctor listens to my needs and complaints and addresses them accordingly.

1	I have been going to my doctor for years and feel I have a good relationship with him and trust him with providing me with information to take care of myself
1	My last physician I really didn't care for her to much. She was not professional enough for me. She took to long and to get to see me but when she did see me I wasn't there long at all. Her office was to small and she constantly had drug reps there. I know that she was very busy but I think she needs to learn how to schedule her patients and not have them sitting for hours just to see her. She has a very important role and she has a very nice staff but I think her office could be ran better than that.
1	My doctor is very forth coming with information and explains my options so I can make the best decision.
-1	I believe doctors will just throw pills at issues that I go to them for and would like cures more than pills.
1	My primary doctor always have been sincere with me, I have full confidence on him, is great in all senses actually 
-1	I think doctors are alright, but I feel hesitant with medical professionals because there are so many institutional biases such as racism, heterosexism, classism, and transphobia. I don't feel comfortable opening up to physicians about my sexuality because there is usually some judgement on their end about it. 
-1	Don't have a physician and primary care. Or doctor to trust or distrust in a general care need in general
-1	I trust her as she knows i am the kind of person who will bring an issue to her, take my meds appropriately and calls me back
-1	i trust them alot. they know what to do for me. they give me meds i need.  i like her and her practice
1	I have always trusted my primary care physician, since they have always given me the means to get better when I am ill. I believe my doctor has no ill intent regarding my health, but might be more skeptical of someone who is not a doctor.
-1	I neither trust or distrust my doctor. While I know he will give me what he believes is the correct diagnosis I also believe he will recommend a drug that is more expensive than others or try to get me to go to see another doctor for the issue to get a commission. 
1	I trust that my physician will care for my best interest and what is best for me. She is not self centered and is very good at her job.
1	MY DOCTOR IS HIGHLY EDUCATED WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE D AND HIS ADVICE HAS ALWAYS PROVEN TO BE RIGHT
-1	I trust my doctor because he is thorough and caring and asks a lot of questions and persists in a considerate manners even when I seem hesitant and uncomfortable. He is friendly and calm. 
-1	Sometimes doctors are all about what they think is best and not caring much about what the patient things. I say this from experience as with taking a medication I knew that was making me rather sick and the doctor not listening and not taking me off of the medication because he didn't feel the need to look into other options.
-1	Because of past experience I have with this doctor. I would really like to find a new doctor but haven't had a positive experience trying to find a good one.
1	She has been pretty accurate and her assessments of my health.  She gives me advice that is reasonable and feasible.
-1	i think most of them do what is right for the patients but some dont. i have a good amount of trust in doctors
1	She has known owe a long time. She knows what is best for me. She is very knowledgable about my health.
-1	I trust my doctor. I know where he lives. I know where his children go to school. He knows I know this.  I trust my doctor.
-1	I have been in a situation before that could have been life threatening and he made a decision and did a procedure that saved my life
1	I have a good relationship with my primary care physician.  She is thoughtful, caring and provides me with all of the information I need in order to make decisions regarding my care.  We are truly partners in my health and well-being.  I trust her judgment and she knows that if I question or disagree with something she says we can discuss it in more depth and reach a mutual understanding.
-1	My primary care physician only seems to know the basics.  He has diagnosed a few things others missed.
-1	After multiple tests, a doctor decided that all my issues were a result of stress and that there was nothing they could do or suggest for me.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he is honest with me even If I don't like what he is saying. He is a gentle speaker. He thinks about what he is going to say before he just says them. He also gives me options.
-1	I know I can trust my PCP because of the time she spends with me during a visit and the questions she asks. She always listens to me and has a good answer. She and her staff follow through with what I need.
-1	my doctor always seems rushed and doesn't always have time to listen to my concerns. I typically get the bare minimum and then look things up online for myself
1	I trust my primary care doctor because he told me things straight up and had no problem explaining anything to me and told me things other doctors probably wouldn't even mention. My doctor is very trust worthy in my eyes.
-1	I used to trust my doctor, but had to go to a new one when the old one retred. I'm not certain that I fully trust the younger new physician I am using.
-1	I trust   my primary  care  doctor   to provide   my needs. They   provide   my   needs and tell  me how to take  care of   my   health   they are  concerned  about   my   health .
-1	I feel that my doctor looks out for my best interests. She gives me advice when I ask . Tells me what I need to do to feel better .
-1	I could create sentences. No need to. And since I'm gonna be forced to I'm going to probably get an attitude with this question. Pointless things like long waits and attitudes when patients ask for simple things ,- food, water, soda, etc. Those are the things people consume at home and could possibly help in the decision making process of healing. 
1	My doctor holds nothing back from me she explains all options in detail and lets me make the final decision
-1	He has many years of education and experience. But he is also most likely getting kickbacks from drug companies which may influence his prescribing of medicine.
-1	my doctor is knowledgeable but good gracious they do not have time for you. They are always in a hurry, are as impersonal as possible and that creates a perfect distrust for me.
-1	It's a matter of information that is given. If you get multiple opinions and it's the same diagnosis, then it is right, but if there is disagreements then something is amiss
-1	My primary physician is a holistic doctor.  He has pulled me through some really tough situations that conventional medicine could not address.  Yes, I have complete trust in him and in his associates
1	Because I have a good doctor I trustHer she is good and works with meWhat more do you want me to say that's all I can say
-1	he ahs experience and doesn't lecture just tells it like it is and lets the chips fall where they may and the consequences of such actions.
-1	You can trust your doctor to tell you about your condition and what the doctor tell you about your illness
-1	In most circumstances I put my faith in my doctor's opinion, though I am aware that physicians are often bribed by pharmaceutical companies in effort to increase prescriptions written for their given product.  As such I always like to do my own research or get a 2nd opinion on said issues.
-1	yes i trust primary care physician as they provide good services in hospital so that in future i dont get any trouble
1	She always takes into considerations all my concerns and answers my questions thoroughly. Has a lot of patience with me, and never makes me feel judged or that she's basing her judgment on a stereotype or character judgment. Takes care of my varied problems the best she can with what I can do.
1	My primary care physician is very much straight to the point. I only see him once a year because I am rarely sick. 
-1	I trust my doctor before I do it is good to trust your doctor because they are your doctor and t is good
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for a long time.  she always gives me good and trust advise
-1	My primary care physician has taken an interest in my health and well being and has shown herself to be someone who has my interests in mind. She is caring and trustworthy.
-1	I have a physician that takes the time to explain all of his decisions, I also look up his decisions on line at different sites
1	My trust in my doctor depends on which doctor I go to. For instance, I trust my general physician and gynocologist but not my dermotologist because he doesn't give me a lot of attention and seems to be in it only for the money.
-1	"My doctor seems to provide a lot of information and entertain any questions, even if they don't see particularly well thought-out or ""smart"""
-1	Inboxd I am not a problem, I have been a long way. the only one that won't happen to know that you have a lot of people who are you a lot of people. the first to know about it, and the 
1	Because I routinely ask probing questions about their opinions, medications, and treatment options. I rarely make up my mind about a Physician until I seen then on multiple occasions. Occasionally, I research their background and consult other physicians about their reputations.
-1	I trust them to do the right thing whenever possible. Listening to a patient explain their problems is utmost in doctors minds to assist them in recovery.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. Although I might not always agree with his or her diagnosis, I have their trust and mine theirs. I would not go to a physician who I wouldn't trust. I need to feel comfortable talking about anything with my doctor. 
1	I trust my doctor to give me the right advice concerning my health and give me information on how to take better care of myself. 
-1	I have been going to the same office for my whole life, so I feel that the team of physicians there is invested in my family and I. I am comfortable with them and their decisions as a result.
1	First of all its I do not trust to many people, do the doctors and nurses, police and everybody else falls into this category.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has the education and experience to make the right decisions pertaining to my health
1	My doctor takes time to listen to my questions and explains things in simple terms. He is very kind, compassionate and patient.
-1	Sometimes i know my body more and know how to react to things. I dont necessarily believe fully in pharmaceuticals. 
-1	For the most part, he seems to care. He seems to be very smart and thorough. He has made good judgement when it comes to my health care. He seems to be knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. He has a calming effect on me. I like his personality. 
-1	I take what any doctor says with a grain of salt.  I do not see them as gods or absolute authorities.  I do respect their knowledge, however I blend it with my own knowledge as well.  I'm the only one who has lived in my body all my life, therefore I am the authority of my body.
-1	Doctors do not all have the same opinion. Best to always have a second opinion, or third. At least I would do this.
-1	I don't trust doctors because they are only doctors so they can make big bucks, not because they care about helping people. They do not listen to what you tell them, they are in a hurry to get you in and out so they can charge you the money and get on to the next person.
1	He takes his time and listens to me. He takes what I say seriously and gives me the impression he cares
-1	I've been going to her for many years.  She is as good of a doctor as anyone.  However, sometimes I feel my opinion and desires are ignored.
-1	It's difficult for my PCP to find the time to see me, and when she does, I almost always feel rushed and unable to get through my appointment in a timely manner.
-1	"My doctor doesn't take the time to listen. She makes it a priority to only spend so much time with you. She even said to me last time ""I don't think I'll have time for that today"" Didn't offer another appointment either. It was an issue I was really concerned about. I told her I was worried and she did give me an extra 3 minutes and a referral. I'm glad I'm being assigned a new doctor in a month "
-1	The majority of doctors I've seen dismiss what I say and treat me like a number. They're always in a rush and want to just get in and out, instead of taking the time to listen to what my concerns are. They just want to shove pills at you and get you out the door, instead of exploring underlying issues.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has never led me astray. He seems genuine in his concern for my health and the methods I need to use to fix whatever ailment I have. 
-1	Doctors or primary care physicians often rush their patients. A visit is too quick to get to the bottom of one's needs. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician and I do have a primary care physician who has always been trustworthy. They are known to have a good reputation within the community.
-1	I just that my primary Care physician is well educated on the subjects at hand i mean he doesn't have a degree for nothing right
-1	doctors are too busy seeing people that they have trouble keeping up with the new things that are being learned.
-1	mostly trust but no one is perfect and dont hold them to 100.  If they do get something wrong or if they cant do what I expect then I can flex to what they are thinking or doing at the time
1	I have been going to my doctor for over twenty years. He's the best doctor I have ever had. He will always tell me the truth about my health conditions and what kind of treatment is needed for them. He will then let me decide which one I want. He never suggests a treatment that I do not need. The two times I have gone through cancer, he was extremely helpful and caring. At appointments, he always takes his time with me and other patients. In other words, he does not rush through them as some doctors do.
-1	The doctors these days seem not to care about the patient. They are only interested in how many patients they can see per day and how much money they can make. They don't seem to care about the patient and how they feel.
1	Because he has always told the truth and he always gives me a solution to my discomforts or diseases
1	They define the position for the organization, for potential applicants, and legally. If there's any question about whether a staff member is actually doing her job, or being asked to perform duties that have nothing to do with her position, the job description should clarify the situation. It should also make it clear who's ultimately responsible for specific tasks or areas.
-1	Because Doctors do care about my health and for my whole body to feel much better.Sometimes Doctors don't care or didn't do a good job when it comes to asking so many questions and Got me upset, about something.that's awkward.Doctor's are there to find out what's going on with my health and to learn about me getting the help I need.
1	My doctor is thorough and caring. I know he keeps up with the latest research, because he mentions that. I am sure that he is doing the best he can.
-1	I don't trust the government which employs doctors. They put stuff in our medicine that makes us worst or sick and these doctors just follow. 
1	if I did not trust him I would not continue to go to him.  he always explains things well and in words that I can understand
-1	I tell my doctor problems and he brushes it off. He does not respect my needs.  He is too cold. I told him about a knot on my foot 6 months ago. He ignored it. Now it is painful and bigger
1	I have had my primary care doctor for about 25 years now, so I trust her completely. She is always upfront and honest with me all the time. 
-1	I trust my doctor because he is dealing with someone's health and helping them survive.  Doctors want to help people that's whey they become doctors and why they are committed.
-1	Because I think doctors only care about the bottom line, Money.  Rarely have I ever met a doctor I thought he knew what he was doing ! 
1	I trust my psychiatrist because I've been seeing him for years. This is someone who has seen me at my absolute worst, and has watched me pick myself up and turn my life around. I trust him because he never makes me feel judged or like I'm just another patient that needs to get in and out of his office. 
-1	They take oaths I disagree with I know pharmaceutical sales reps who tell me info about drug pushing To many politics with insurance 
-1	I do not have a primary care dr. I just moved and havent found a new dr yet,will be finding one soon
1	My doctor is out for my best interest. He will make decisions not based on his hospital's needs, but the patient.
1	I trust her.. cause Ive had other doctors.. and shes now a female which und erstands my needs alittle better... and always gives me her open and honest opinion.. 
-1	Sometimes doctors do not take the time to really look at the whole picture and just prescribe what is common for a condition
-1	You should always trust your doctor to give you the best care you can receive. Doctors are not there to purposely harm you, they care about you and want the best for you. Not every doctor will have the right answer but you should still trust them 
1	I have had the same primary physician for almost thirty years.  he has earned my trust. he has always given me good advice and care.
1	because me and my mom have been going to him over 15 years and he has never been wrong for both of us and seems honest and caring and always meets our needs
-1	i have been misdiagonsied in the past and have changed dr because of this i also have had bad experiences when i knew i was sick and they refuse to treat me untill i have almost be hospitalized. I really feel that they don't know there pt and really just treat u like a number and a bill
1	I have a background in the medical field and am able to effectively build a rapport with my physician to ensure a trustworthy relationship 
-1	i read my medical documents, and they are two-faced, call my condition fake, reason that I lost my disability.  
1	i believe they tell you the truth about everything and they are sincere and most of them are good doctors and treat there paitents very good i have a very good doctor who is always there when i need him
-1	I dont trust all doctors but my primary physician is a very nice man. He is very thorough and honest but always uplifting and looks on the bright side.
1	I trust my primary doctor to tell me what I need to know to take care of my health. I am confident she will give it to me straight. I trust what my doctor has to say.
-1	Being on Medicaid, I don't see Dr's but students who are still learning and sometimes don't know or make mistakes.
-1	Do not go to doctor. If I feel good, there is no reason to waste mine or the doctor's time and money.
-1	I do trust my doctor and they do get second opinions about my healthif not more opinionsand more tests 
1	I Have A Caring Primary Physician Who I Have Known Intimately For Several Decades And To Whom I Can Communicate Very Easily.
-1	to explain the reasons is moot inane and asinine.  questions like this destroy the survey experience
-1	I think sometimes they see only what they want.  They ignore what I tell them in regards to symptoms.  If the symptoms do not match the tests or diagnosis they do not count.  So this is why I only trust doctors part way.
-1	I have a terrific pcp and I feel it's so easy to talk to her. I am also very strong about what is right for me, so as much as I trust her I make my own decisions.
-1	I have a reasonable amount of trust in my primary care physician, but I am not afraid to ask for and make sure I get a second or sometimes even a third opinion if I dont agree with what my pcp is saying.
1	dr paddord has saved my life twice  once when i was septic and once when i was extremely anemic.transferring me to st. patrick hospital in missoula mt both times saved my life
-1	I trust my doctor. I have been giving second opinions from other doctors that have confirmed what my doctor said. 
-1	that what they are there for give us the best advice regarding our health and mental wealth that's what they studied for
1	I trust my doctor because in the past she has encouraged me to seek a second opinion, she has done what she could to avoid surgical procedures (even though eventually it had to be done), and she always gives the most minimally invasive options.
-1	The doctor I've been seeing is mean and ignort. Can't ask him questions and get scared to say anything at all around him. Even his nurses look like they Dont want to ask anything
1	he knows what he is talking about tats atatdr is all that i can think of at this time isaid that it is
-1	I believe people--including medical professionals--operate from their own built-in biases and those biases can result in a doctor's not offering up ALL options, choices and decisions that are out there for consideration. For example, if a doctor believes in saving lives at all costs, he's not likely to suggest hospice care to a patient who has entered or is close to entering the terminal phase of life.
-1	I trust my doctor because he understands my needs and listens to what I am telling him.
1	i trust him because he is a very smart individual.  Nearly everything he  does for me or recommends seem to work out for the better.; weather its advice or prescribing medication for me.
-1	He has his head in his laptop more than he looks at me, he doesn't talk or explain things anymore, I am changing doctors soon.
1	I have a good relationship with my doctor. I knew him for along time and he will always tell me the truth but, will let me decide what I want to do. He is willing to answer any questions I might have and give me the honest answer.
-1	Because whenever I have had a health problem I have been treated well and achieved good results by staying healthy and stable, without having to buy or consume unnecessary medicines
-1	I do not have a primary care physician so it is impossible for me to answer the above questions. For that reason I had to answer neutral.
-1	My current doctor says i have one problem that is not really true and sometimes contradicts what others with more knowledge would say
-1	"She answers all of my questions and gives reasons why she is advocating something that I may ""waffle' with.  She listens carefully appearing to see that I as a patient do know myself quite well."
-1	I believe most doctors do settle for medications when there are other alternatives available. Medications are very expensive, some doctors get kickbacks from sales. I believe most harsh medications actually cause worse physical reactions.
1	i have had the same doctor for 22 years he tells me every thing about my health he holds nothing back he is trueful to me about my health and tells me what i need to do for my own good where i like it or not
-1	My doctor is older and experienced. He is down to earth. He knows the answers to most of my questions. He is encouraging.
1	I chose my doctor, for good recommendations, good studies in a university that I trust and good results
1	My doctor does not seem rushed when she is with me. She is calm, takes her time, and explains everything.  If I have questions, she answers them fully. She never makes me feel stupid for asking any questions, and never makes me feel like she needs to get on to the next patient. I feel like I have her full attention. 
1	I have had him for 25 years. We work together to keep me healthy. He considers the whole person not just the malady.
1	she is the best out there, i know because we live in a small town and everyone knows everyone so everybody knows my doctor she is thoughtful explanatory and super nice
1	i trust him but im smart enough to research things outside of the office to make sure he is correct in what hes telling
-1	My doctor misdiagnosed me for two years. When I found out what was wrong with me he refused to listen. I hired an attorney and had him send a letter so I could get a referral to a neurologist. They agreed with my self diagnosis. Same thing happened with my GYN and my chronic problems. They could do a google search and help me but their fucking egos or laziness stops them.
1	My PCP has invested time in understanding my medical history and general health.  She is thorough and careful in explanations, such that I believe I have sufficient information to make necessary decisions.  She takes a whole-system approach to health, and will check in with my preferences for, e.g., pharmaceutical vs. alternative treatment for an illness or injury.
1	I have know my primary care physician for 15 years and have never had an issue with how she or her staff have treated me. She is also my wife's primary care dotor.
-1	They sometimes just give pills to cure a situation without getting to the root of the cause.  They don't have time to discuss a plan that would work for me instead of pills.
1	Cause the physician knows what he/she is talking about and is dedicated to. The physician has no axes to grind and has no other agenda than to render the best care.
-1	They are sincere and experienced, but would like to make a lot of money with my visits, which I do understand but most of the time the outcome is generated office visits.
-1	I sometimes trust and distrust doctor. I have had a bad experience when My mom passed away due to A doctor sugar coating things for my mom many years ago. He did not give her guidance or answer any questions about her illness, thus I have many trust issues with any doctor. Including dentist or a nurse. 
1	Because he tells me truthfully the best course to take and it is always right and leads me in the right direction.
-1	I trust in doctors in general because they studied during many years their carears and they are well prepared .
-1	My primary doctor is an associate professor at a large teaching hospital. He takes the time to listen to me. 
1	This is another young doctor with fresh eyes I went to a set of doctors for seventeen years trusted them totally until about two years ago when I had two huge tumors growing on each upper thigh and this doctor I have now discovered it.
-1	I trust them to know a lot more than I do but if it sounds wrong to me I will definitely seek a second or third opinion. I will do research online also just to see if others have the same issues.
-1	Medical care has declined as insurance provision has decreased.  Fewer people are seeking the education to become a doctor because they don't make enough money - this due to the low quality of insurance and the amount paid by insurance companies; therefore the quality of doctors has gone down and most doctors are foreign and don't speak good English.
1	Thus far I haven't had a reason to not trust him, he's done a fine job with my care as far as I can tell.
1	My doctor has been right about diagnoses for myself and my husband and treats us with appropriate medications for our needs with few side effects.  I feel I can rely on our doctors' advise and prognosis.
-1	I do not have medical insurance nor a PCP.  Thus, any statements relating to primary care physicians is moot.
-1	I don't trust my primary care physician very much. She is nice but doesn't know what to do with me at times when I get sick. There are very few times that she will call my specialists to ask for help or advice on how to treat me in the most effective way.
-1	doctors don't take time to know their patients i don't believe that have enough information about me to give me best advice or medicine
1	I am really comfortable talking to my doctor about treatments and medicines.  I have no problem  discussing anything I don't understand or feel that it's  not the right medicine or treatment for me.  My doctor and I have an open dialog
1	I have been seeing my doctor for about 20 years now and have not been steered wrong. We have a close relationship and I can talk to him about anything.
-1	I used to not trust my other Doctor, but them I got rid of him and now I have a new doctor. I trust my new doctor a lot more than my old one. I don't put my trust in anyone too much, but I trust this new doctor a little bit more.
1	I feel as though i trust my primary physician because she ecplains things to me so i can understand and she always allows me to ask as many questions as i would like. And if i ask her to test me gor something she does it.
1	I will always trust my doctor because he is the best at what he does plus he very honest and open minded I can ask him anything  and hes always honest
1	Our PC is extraordinarily thorough. If I cad to criticize anything, it would be that all of his concerns share the same high priority.
-1	They know me better than I know myself and have always given me good advice and care. If I didn't trust them then I would probably switch to a different doctor. Trust is definitely important 
1	in the end she usually is right. if I did not trust her I would get a new doctor. so far I have no reason not to trust her.
-1	easy to talk to have no medical problems that require anything extra than the usual  upkeep of yearly physical and any pre screenings that are for my age
-1	Most doctors are trustworthy, their time is so valuable that they tend to cut to the chase and give only a few minutes and rarely find out how you really are doing.
1	I have been seeing my primary care physician for many years. I trust him implicitly to attend to my health and well being.
-1	He knows my condition and what is the best form of treatment for me, always answers my questions and addresses my concerns
-1	I feel my doctor is getting ready to retire and doesn't really care about anything anymore. He just hands out pills to everyone and doesn't reall explain what they are for or what they can do to you. Time to find a new doctor that cares.
-1	I do in some ways trust my doctor or sometimes if they have a lot of patients then I am not as trusting
-1	I am currently between doctors, but in general, I haven't experienced any issues where a doctor seemed to dismiss my concerns or rush me.
-1	I think I can trust my doctors to do the right think.  There are too many checks and balances. My doctor works as part of a team of care providers.
1	My doctor always seems to be upfront and honest with me. He provides me with the information i need to be proactive in taking care of my health. 
1	he is very dedicated and thoroughly professional hhe is also kbowledgeable and cring and always follows up on things i trust him completely
-1	I trust my doctor, because she is the only one I have seen to diagnose me correctly and treat me accordingly. She has improved my day-to-day life, while the others have only done what they find convenient. 
1	She considers information provided and what she sees. She is a known, competent authority and a worthwhile resource. That reputation has been earned over the years.
-1	my primary care physicians have never given me a reason to distrust them so i trust them until there is a reason to distrust them.
-1	I trust him because he always takes the time to do the correct test. He listens to my concerns and questions then explains everything calmly to me. 
1	If you ask a question and they don't give you a answer and just walk away makes me distrust the doctor and if they give you a answer makes me trust them.
-1	i have used the same physician for 20+ years. in the last few years, he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor who i felt was completely incompetent , he has hired a pa that is not  listening to me, is affiliated with a hospital where i spent 3 days in pure hell (incompetence running rampant.), renewed a prescription and then a month later called the pharmacy and cancelled it( it was blood pressure medicine..i can't believe these things are going on in his office without his knowledge..
-1	For the most part, she isn't like most doctors. There have been a few times where we didn't agree on certain treatments, but in the end, we birth found something that was helpful to the both of us 
1	I trust my primary care physician, because I have been her patient for a while. She makes sure she asks me about my current condition. She listened to my concerns, and doesn't only give me one option when it comes to treatments. She also asks about my family and career. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they have never been wrong in my treatment and refer me to other if they don't know
-1	road without stop supplement symptom standard of simple way to synthesize stable to saturate the account upload 
1	They make me feel cared for and I know that they know what they are talking about. They also make it a point to explain things to me so I completely understand.
1	My doctor and I love each other and we have a blast every time I see him and he is very thorough with me about everything.
-1	My doctor has always been very open and honest with me and she has not had an issue telling me how she feels in regards to my own health and well being.
-1	they are giving me the right meds that are gettig my body back to where it needs t help and helpi me to feel better
-1	I have to have a cat scan in a few months for my back, and I had already gotten an X-Ray, my doctor says I should have a Cat scan, but I'm very small. I think a cat scan will be too powerful for my back and very harmful to my body, but my doctor didn't think differently. I hope when doctors make these decisions they think realistically with their patients. 
-1	Doctors are out for money and income.. They don't care about your welfare. They are not honest and care about your health.
1	She spends time with me and tells me what she feels is the best treatments for me.She is caring and listens to me.
-1	I distrust my pcp because he once delayed giving me test results for months when they were available and I contacted him over and over for them.
1	I have ab excellent relationship with my Doctor and feel she has the background and skills necessary to manage my health and health issues.
-1	why not trust someone whose job is to make you better? its their job so i feel like they would want to be honest and help me as much as they can
1	She tells me exactly how she feels and makes sure that I receive all the tests I need to take.  She is available to me 7/24.
-1	He is not very knowledgeable about my condition called hypothyroidism but I have done a lot of research and know more then he does so that makes the matter complicated
1	I trust my primary care physician because she takes the time to listen, solicits input, and carefully explains everything to me.

-1	When boredom strikes in the restrooms and customer service to you with the wedding is coming tomorrow night at family dollar store for a few years and I have to be a little more time to tell you that I get home I'll be there in a bit more of an effort in a bit more than the wedding is coming tomorrow night at the time but if the girl is still interested in a bit more than I was going to go to tell bay area of an effort in a bit more than I can count on the wedding and I get home I'll be back to the house 4th to tell bay friends and 
-1	It is hard to trust him when he is rushed and not really answering my questions. I feel that he sees a lot of malingering and assumes that my issues are not as harmful as other people's. I tend to downplay my concerns. I don't want to be a bother to him.
-1	I feel they are too busy inputing data in the computer to be able to hear my issues.  My meds were inputted wrong and I am having a devil of a time to solve that issue. I tell that what I need and then it does not get done.  And I have to call and hound them for weeks to get my issues resolved. It is horrible that you can not trust the office staff to do what needs to be done.  I am able to voice my opinion but some people do not understand that they need to disagree and have a voice in their treatment plans.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for over 20 years, and he knows me very well. He is calm and careful and is able to make better recommendations because he knows about my family, my lifestyle, my history, etc. He stays current with medical literature and developments in healthcare.
1	My doctor has always been upfront with me regarding my health care and options. Very through with my testing and responsible with overseeing my wellbeing.
-1	My doctor talks extensively with me about any feelings I may have regarding my health or treatment. I feel I can say anything to him or her (I have two physicians) about what I'm feeling or worried about, therefore, I feel I can trust them in my care & treatment.
-1	I believe mu doctor is too set in her own opinions, and reluctant to support my wishes which are based on my experience with previous doctors.
1	"Although we don't know what is totally wrong with me, he hasn't given up looking for the answers and what might help me in the meantime. Never once did he think that it was ""all in my head"" as many would have. He always takes the time to listen to me even if it goes beyond the alloted time and never makes the appt feel rushed. He addresses all my concerns and conditions @ each visits. "
-1	I mostly trust my physician, however, I am concerned that he is not thorough enough.  I feel as though I have to request standard tests that should be routine for my age.
1	I have a very good doctor, and I trust her implicitly. The rest of her team is also trustworthy, and I have no qualms about visiting any of them.
1	She is honest and is down to earth. She has my well being has her first priority and she is very thorough
-1	i think my doctor is caring and thoughtful of everything he does and he is truthful about what he says 
1	My doctor is very caring and open about my health. If I have questions I can expect truthful answers and not judgement.
1	My doctor is a honest person. She would never lie to me.  I trust her completely. I know her. She is a very good doctor.
-1	Well I trust my Doctors sometimes. I think they have my best interest in mind, but I can overcome the nagging feeling that them just a paycheck to them
1	my doctor takes the time to explain test results and procedures, also the reason why certain medications have been prescribed
1	He has gone above and beyond for me. He has made referrals to several places, ordered tests, and tried to get to the bottom of my health issues
-1	"Sometimes I feel as if my PCP doesn't take my concerns serious and just brushes them to the side. My doctor sometimes has this ""I'm the professional and your not"" kind of attitude, as if she is trying to make me feel dumb. She is also not very comforting."
1	The doctor i choose would be the best in his or her field to help make a person better. I made sure they special specialist and know the ins-and-outs about what the condition of the patient and make sure they run a lot of test
-1	I feel my doctor is easy to talk too understands my health providing the best medications for my health issues
-1	My doctor is usually very thorough. He listens intently to everything that I try to communicate to him.He shows genuine concerne for my well being.
1	My doctor is a smart man and asks me questions about how I feel and then makes the diagnosis.  If I say that doing spiritual things help then he trusts my instincts. If I tell him that a medicine doesn't work then we change it.
-1	my PCP is new to me.  still getting to know him, only seen him 3 times.  my initial reaction is that he is NOT very proactive and that concerns me.
-1	i do not trust anyone now days. to many things go wrong and to much sueing going on these days. doctors seem like they just want your money more than your well being
1	I have had good experiences so far, he is thorough and very good at explaining all aspect of the treatments he dispenses and is an excellent listener 
1	Doctors are very well trained at what they do and how much they know. They have to keep doing continuing education to keep their skills up to par.
1	I completely liked my doctor the moment I met her I trust her to do the best possible care for me she answers any questions I have and is very patient I never feel rushed
1	Feel totally free to talk about anything and to ask questions of my doctor.  Think she understands me and she is always willing to go the extra mile for my benefit.
-1	i suppose i trust them. i wanted to rule out some stuff, try some more their sophisticated tech there,..... 
1	My doctor wants to know about my activities and life so she can better address my medical problems not just the lab work
1	I trust my primary care doctor because they went to school to know what they are doing. Also if it sounded like they didn't know what they were doing I would not go to them 
1	I trust my doctor because she is smart, caring, takes time to hear and listen to my issues. She genuinely cares for me.
1	I feel my doctors have always been honest with me. They have always all options for a treatment and the informaion foe me to make a good decision
1	If she does not know the solution to my problem she will refer me to someone who is an expert in that field.
1	He reviews all my conditions with me, asks questions, and then follows up with personalized suggestions or comments.  
1	I think he is great. He takes great care of me. He makes sure I do what I need to to feel better. He always listens
-1	For the most part I feel the information provided is accurate, I don't believe the doctor would give wrong information intentionally and if I feel unsure a second opinion is ok to get.
-1	I have been going to the same dr for over 30 years. He knows me and all my ailments and quirks so I believe that he has my best interest in mind even if I don't aways agree with him. If anything he is a little over protective. I like the when my husband goes to see him, the dr always asks about me and visa versa when I go to see him. There are times I have had to fight with him to get my husband the specialized care I feel he needs but I dont have to fight too hard and when the office refused to see my husband once because he didn't have the co-pay, our Dr threw a fit and told them they are NEVER to do that again. He is more than our doctor, he is our friend.
-1	i trust most of them in general because they have enough schooling to know what to do and what not to do in most situations
1	My doctor has never failed me or my family.  Anytime we have ever gone to her she takes her time to get to the bottoms of what is wrong.  I trust her not only with myself but also my child.
-1	Because of Accidents in y Life, I have had to deal with a lot of different kinds of Dr's and I have seen how Good and How Bad they can Really be
1	I trust my doctors because my doctor helped me get well again an does his best to put me on the right medication an make sure I'm in good health 
1	I have been a patient of this doctor for many years and we work together on solving my medical issues. I completely trust her judgement on what the plan of action should be.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been with her for years . She knows me very well .She can tell when i'm uncomformable about something she recommends and we talk about it sometimes we compromise .
1	she's caring and thoughtful. she always has my best interest in mind. she truly cares about my health.
1	She is confident, intelligent and excellent diagnostician. .I do have complete trust  in her capabilities.
1	My present doctor is the best I have ever had.  He is a Polish Jew and is very caring and compassionate.
-1	"My primary care physician is ""new"" (at least to me) and a bit young and naÃ¯ve. She knows practically nothing about diabetes, yet tries to micro-manage me and my condition, never understanding why her methods of treatment aren't working well. Thought my Endocrinologist and I had finally gotten my primary care doctor ""out of the picture,"" then she reared her ugly head again. Now I'm again faced with having to satisfy BOTH of them!"
1	she been my doctor for so many years and all the sickness i had she got me through all of them. she alway tell me what is wrong and what i need to take and do to get better
1	I do not thoroughly trust my primary physician I trust my cardiologist the most especially since I had a heart attack last month and a double bypass,I don't feel like my primary physician was doing all he should have prior to my having a heart attack  
-1	I really have no reason to distrust my PCP.  So far, she has not proposed anything which I felt to be wrong.  Further, I'll ask questions should I feel uncertain.
-1	It's not that I don't trust him I just think he has limited information.  No one can be on top of all of the new treatments but I think he does the best he can.  He is happy to refer me to specialists or others that might have a better grasp of a health issue.  For that reason alone, I have learned to trust his guidance.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician she is very thorough and explains everything to me so I understand it
1	I trust my doctor she is always listening and gets to the bottom of it or she keeps trying! The office is also friendly and supportive.
-1	My primary care physician studied for years at medical schools and colleges in order to learn their practice and become a medical professional. They took an oath to help people and never cause harm and so this causes me to trust them and believe they have my best intentions at heart. 
1	My Doctor explains everything to me, sometimes I do not grasps everything but if it is put in his notes I can look it up. If I need to see him he will see me but I will have to wait to be squeezed between appointments of other people. 
1	I am typically a type of person who does not like medication being the first option for everything. My doctor understands that and will give me other options that don't include medication.
-1	My doctor at times will rush me out the office instead of listening to my questions.  Therefore making me not trust in her as much ah I would like
-1	I had a doctor that did all of the things above and I trusted him completely but he left medical practice and went into administration.  I now have a new doctor and have only seen her a couple of times so there hasn't been time to develop the trust you need with a doctor.  So far this doctor seems only interested in making money off of the insurance companies.
-1	always very trustworthy, been going to the same doctor for 10 years now, always very good to me and treats me right, i don't feel like they are doing anything that would make me distrust them
1	i believe that health care is mainly a way of making money. Maybe there are some providers that are honest and caring but the majority are in it for the money
-1	He's a good doctor he has helped me with my lower back to see the pain management doctor but the people that work for him doesn't do there job with referrals for me for mental health
1	They are here to help people no matter what is going on with them. They are there to listen. Doctors are there to treat you no matter what
-1	In a few sentences, please explain the reasons why you trust or distrust your primary care physician. If you do not have a primary care physician, please answer in regard to doctors in general . i trust my physician or doctor because they want what is best for me
-1	based on my experience with the doctor over time and in various circumstances relating to my health and my own knowledge and research
-1	I have always had good and wonderful doctors with very good to excellent care..I haven't had any bad experiences with my doctors or bad care
-1	I trust him to a point - he is so busy seeing a lot of patients at any given time I sometimes wonder if he really understands all my problems/ailments. 
-1	My physician is always in a hurry and sometimes doesn't take the time to listen or to explain things to me. I have considered finding another physician for this reason.
-1	before this survey I had never gave it a seconf thought  I automatically think that the doctor know what he is talking about
1	I trust them to the fullest extent they are very well trained have went to college and always looking out for the best with their patients I would never have a reason to not trust my doctor they are recommended by other people I know and deal with alot people 
-1	i think that doctors do whats best in part for the money. An are more interested in bringing in more patients, as it is why they try to keep people on medicine.
1	I have been going to my primary doctor for over 27 years and my mother went before me.  He works with a team of doctors from UPMC so that all of my doctors are aware of what is going on with me and develop a plan to figure out what is best for me.  
1	My primary care physician has been our family's doctore for 25 years. He is a caring man who explains thing in depth to my wife & I.
1	The doctor seems quite professional and knowledgeable. And seems to be genuinely interested in hearing what I have to say.
-1	He is a good doctor. He tries to make comfortable.  Good staff, nice offices. I can usually get in and out without crazy long waits.
1	 tust my primary physician because she always explains everything in detail to me and takes time for me
1	I have worked with for many years and found his advice to be very good and has helped be get over various health issues in a reasonable time by following it.
-1	He has been my family doctor for many years. He has seen us through many health crisises. He is very  good at referring us when he feels we need specialists.
-1	I dont really have a primary doctor at this time. So I generally believe that doctors are trustworthy, to what degree, however, is debatable.
-1	they are usually honest up front about what is going on with me. ask if I have any questions on anything. a few times the doctor did not read when I listed I can't do clartin allergy pills or nasal spray
-1	I trust my primary care physician because they tend to know better than I do what is better for me when it comes to my health
-1	They are kind and know what they are doing.  She never seems to rush and always has time for my questions
-1	There is changes to history spying something about Obama nh court so A bomb attack japanese and destroy all freedom of information Cuba in history spying
-1	I guess I would say I trust him. I feel I dont have any other choice. I dont think my dr would want to misinform me
-1	Physicians no longer care about their patients. It's about whatever metric the health system that owns their practice. They typically overbook. They don't care about keeping patients waiting. If you have an additional question that is raised during their cursory assessment, they ask you to make another, separate appointment in order to address those concerns. Nurses are fat and act annoyed that the patients are interrupting their donut break. Another nurse was eating ribs at the desk and barked at me when I had a question. Doctors want to give a quick fix and usually write a prescription instead of looking at the patient holistically and taking the time to do a comprehensive assessment. 
1	Beachsideu doctor ss to care about my needs and have helped me change habits when I didn't want to. Cared about helping me when o was at my lowest and getting me the best help. 
-1	I think sometimes doctors just want to make appointments and prescribe medication in order to make money.
1	She is nice and talks about things openly and never talks rudely about anything or anyone. She is always willing to help with medical needs.
1	I trust my doctor because she's honest and I feel that she care about me and my family. Ive been going to her for several years
-1	Doctors today have a lot on their plate. As a result, they are squeezed into a role which makes them sometimes unapproachable. That means they have to rush through appointments to get as many in as possible. As a result, they are not able to spend the time they need with each patient, assess their needs, and prescribe the right treatment. If a doctor takes the time to assess and communicate with me concerning my medical needs and condition, then I trust him or her. I figure that they know more about medicine than I do, and they are willing to take the time to find out what I really need, medically.
-1	after searching, found one who seems to understand what I need/feel about care from a physician, and after lengthy discussions with him, we have reached a level of understanding and mutual respect for each of out decisions.
-1	I trusted my doctor til she turned me over to a nurse practioner in her practice.  I am not confident with the abilities of the nurse practioner although I do like her as a person.  She seems very kind and sweet.
1	Because I have never been steered wrong by my physician. She has always listened to me when I explain something. also she believes me when I am talking to her 
1	I have two Primary care physician's so I have the luxury of second opinions. I trust both of them as they have been my doctors for a long time and we have a good relationship that is open in every way. They always include my thoughts in discussing medicines and procedures and are quick to chastise me for my lack of discipline on my diet and exercise when needed.
1	I have a tremendous primary care physician who actually takes great pains to make sure I receive excellent medical care. 
-1	i  not very sure  so middle ground is the best way of answering   ............................................................................................................................................................... nothing else I have too say about this  but  they wanted a longer answer  
1	I trust my primary care physician because he listens to me and asks questions. He looks at my chart and asks me follow up questions regarding ongoing medical issues. My previous physicians were already writing prescriptions before I finished talking to them and did not bother to look at my file before meeting with me.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for over 7 years now and had seen her very frequently in the last year. All the treatments she prescribed worked for me and she listened what I had concerns.
1	He is very reassuring and steered me in better directions than previous doctors.  He's up front and honest about every option.
-1	there have been too many occasions when the side effects of doctor's remedies have caused more and worse problems than the original purpose for seeking medical advice
-1	I truly trust my doctor. She seems concerned is always pleasant, answers my questions and gives me lots of options.
1	I trust my primary physician because he listens to what I say, and plays an active part in my health care.
-1	I am on the fence about this one. Not having a specific promo art care doctor, it is a hard question to answer. I broke my ankle in November and was bounced from doctor to doctor to physical therapist to cat scan to everything else under the sun - I never got a straight answer, regardless of how many times I asked, if my ankle was truly broken and if I was doing damage by every single doctor telling me to do something different. 
-1	I always have full trust and my doctor they have my best interest in mind. So there's no reason I shouldn't trust that
1	They are trained professionals.  Why would I not trust them?  It's their job to tell me good and bad news.
1	My oncology team is also my nephews, they have been treating me for six years and him for almost one and they have managed to keep me up and moving despite how difficult it is for me to tell them everything. Plus our main dr is known around the world and is always traveling so thats nice to know.
-1	I don't think they know me well enough to possibly know what is best for me personally. I trust that they're giving me recommendations or information that they think is generally best, though.
-1	You can't be sure who to trust in the medical field, one person is different than the other, but most are all out for the money, not for much else.
-1	Does not take time with me. He is in and out of the room and unabale to ask him questions. He is one doctor and does not have a partner. Lack of communcation between the patient.
-1	I sometimes feel my visits with doctors are rushed because a lot of them see so many patients throughout the day. I feel like when I try to explain things to some of them, they tend to think I don't know what I am talking about.
1	I have complete trust in my primary care physician, if I didn't I would switch my doctor, I have trust in all the medical providers I use and that includes my opthamalogist,  my gastroenterologist, my orthopedist, my dentist, my urologist and any other health care providers I need and my family needs.
-1	ive been seeing my dr since i was 11, 20 years now. she knows me in and out (no pun intended) and i know she has my best interests at heart. she also listens to my opinions and respects when i disagree.
1	my doctor is very good  she is very thorough  and asks me a lot of questions  i like her very much  she always takes a good amount of time with me 
-1	I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN TO DIAGNOSE ME PROPERLY AND TO GIVE ME APPROPRIATE ATTENTION.  IF I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE I WOULD CHANGE DOCTORS.  BUT SO FAR I HAVE NOT HAD A NEED TOL.  
-1	I am in the process of switching physicians so this is not a question I can answer right now. I had been with my doctor for years, but seem to have lost all faith and trust in him
-1	I feel the 'industry' of medicine out weighs the care of patients. Profit is more important than caring for and treating the person. 
1	I believe that my Dr knows em over the years and we have developed a relationship which is trustworthy and honest. We share info when needed without any concerns how the info is received. 
-1	"Never know if they're just pushing what they get paid to push, pills and medications.  Results are hidden in their words of ""care""...never really know what they say unless you research it more."
1	For the most part I trust doctors.  The challenging limitation to my answers is that the VA has cycled through many contract physicians who - individually are intellegent and compassionate - are not around long enough to have a consisted convesation/relationship.
1	My doctor is very thorough and intelligent.  He has always communicated directly to me and his decisions about my treatment have been right on target.
-1	I have never been to trustworthy when it comes to people of the medical staff just do to many story I hear from my friends and family about what has happened to them.
1	She is kind and listens to my medical problems and we talk about them together. She spends the time needed with me to take care of me.
-1	I trust most doctors. No reasons to not trust doctors. I don't know how else to explain it Nothing else to write 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been her patient for  many years and she is always on the ball when it comes to my health. She does not overtest, but will prescribe tests when it is necessary to make sure I am in good health.
-1	I dont trust my doctor because he asked me what medicines i think i should be perscribed.He takes very little time in getting to know what the problem is.He is always in a hurry to be done with the appointment and does not explain things very well
1	I think that most primary care physicians have the knowledge to do what is best for their patients.  They care about their patients well being and take this very seriously.
1	we have a young, enthusiastic doctor who comes from a family of doctors; he listens to me. Since I do a lot of research on medical issues, I feel he is giving me correct information.
-1	I would have to say the reason is they do not call you if blood work or urine comes back as bad unless you go back in a week or so later.  Why can they not just call and give one results over the phone especially when you live far away from a doctors office to begin with.
-1	I feel that she is capable and up-to-date but sometimes doesn't listen to details that might make a difference in my care
1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been going to him for a long time and have had the opportunity to observe what he says about different aspects of my health compared to my own observations, both of which are quite close.
1	My primary care physician always looks for new ways to help with my treatment plan, and so far, everything has worked out very well.
-1	I just feel like they're more worried about how what they can do might impact their career than really paying attention to what's going on
1	he takes the time and effort to explain all health issues. He never seems to be in a big hurry to move onto the next patient
-1	I have a primary care physician. He is trained well and a well learned. He serves me on a good faith. I am satisfied upon him.
-1	I trust my primary physician, because they are consistent about my well being. They always asked if I need anything or any questions I need to ask, or about any problems former or current.
-1	Doctors are not trained to find out what is really going on with a patient instead they are paid off by big Pharma to prescribe
-1	I trust my physician a whole lot. I trust that he/she will give me the perfect advice all or most of time at least and wouldn't stir me the wrong way.
-1	I've had quite a few bad experiences with doctors, so I don't have much confidence in them. Plus lack of health insurance prevents me from having a primary care physician
-1	I generally trust my physician because of past experience. I also tend to recognize the reason for their assessments.
-1	He has always been straight forward.  When something serious has arisen, he has no problem forwarding me on to a specialist for care.  He is quick to respond when I need an appointment.  Sometimes, he is a bit distracted, but then again aren't we all.  Now, you say in the medical world that is not to be, but when he has been this way, it has not been regarding anything really serious and just seemed in a hurry.
-1	Due to issues with my health insurance and past experiences by parents have had. My mother has a rare from of kidney disease, and it took 12 years, 8 doctors, 20 procedures, and 5 surgeries to finally correct the problem and my health insurance didn't want to do their job and pay the doctors due to how many doctors my mom had to visit and had to get help from.
-1	She listens to me and she is always available to answer question or to find the answers for me that she may not know.  
-1	At times I feel the Dr. is rushed and needs to get on with other patients, at times I feel like I should be given the time to write down directions I may forget
-1	She is a good doc but doesnt always like to do what i feel is right treatment for me. Example. I would like the shot for shingles but she says i am not old enough. I also want the pheunemenacocal shot she wont give it. I am almost 51 and want prtected before i get sick
1	I have no reason to not trust her. She seems to truly care about my health and seems to make good decisions for my health.
-1	I trust my primary doctor in all the basics.  But, I have not had to question about something serious, at this point.  Sometimes my doctor seems too busy, but she has never ignored a question or concern
1	MY PHYSICIAN KNOWS ME BY NAME.  HE IS AN INTEGRATED PHYSICIAN AND LOOKS AT NUTRITION AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL MEDICINE.  HE LOOKS AT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM NOT JUST A REGULATING MEDICATION. 
-1	I have a hard in easy life in I try to do the right thing all the time but life can have a way of bring you down in doubt yourself in put you in a negative mood but I try to over come it 
1	My PCP is a very intelligent, capable and thoughtful man. He is actually the first doctor I've ever had who listened to what I said and accepted that I don't always agree with him. He works around it.
-1	I trust my physician because they are thorough. They seem to have my best interest at heart and will go out of their way to help me when i need additional help
-1	"I have a long standing relationship with my primary care doctor.   He ""gets"" me and knows how much to push if extra treatment is involved."
-1	Sometimes there are certain aspects of specialized care that health coverage gets in the way of treating the person as a whole. They are more interested in whether your co-payments is paid up and your monthly premiums are up-to-date.  
-1	I just started with a new primary care physician so I answered based on my experiences with my past doctor.  She always took the time to answer questions and provide information and made sure that everything was understood.  She also was very interested in my thoughts regarding my medical situation and/or treatment.
-1	i do not feel a sense of closeness to my doctor that i would like to feel.  Sometimes he does not seem like he really listens and understands me
-1	It take a mouth for to see Dr then u wait 2 hours and he see u for 5 mins.in the 5 mins he just tell u time for check up .
1	my primary care physician seems like a believable type of person that could provide me with the accurate info that I need to know about my health
1	he has always been honest about everything I have asked or had concerns about responsed to all my needs and truly cares about the welfare of me
1	other than she's my best friend and the smartest person i know. there aren't any more reasons needed
-1	My primary care doctor always tells me the truth. They also always tell me how to help fix things and if I am on track and doing well. I always listen to their advice. 
1	I trust my PCP because she is very caring and if I need a referral she gives me one if she feels my condition is something another doctor needs to handle.
-1	I trust my physician because he cares about me. He always gives me good advice. He doesn't give me medicine that i don't need.
-1	My primary physician is pleasant and listens but I am not sure they always understand what I am telling them.
1	I have had the same physician since I moved to IL which is almost 9 years and I trust her judgement implicitly.  She has proven to me that she has my best interest at heart.
1	Dr. answers my questions whether time  is factor or not.  Does not just give an answer to shut me up, is truthful.
-1	sometimes i really dont trust doctore for the fact they never listen to what you have to say how you really feel , 
-1	I don't trust or distrust a physician. I simply demand what is best for me and require the utmost sincere honesty. Otherwise I change physicians 
1	My doctor has been very dedicated to providing me with good advice and explaining situations so they make sense and in my best interest.
1	She is very open to listening; easy to talk to; demonstrates genuine concern in my health & well-being
-1	My doctor has always helped me to fix what it was I went to him for. He also acted calmly and explained what was going on.
-1	She's always  been excellent in treating me and is a good listener Always helps me whenever I need treatment quickly 
-1	I switched doctors within the program I am enrolled in. The first doctor was not a good fit - I never felt at ease around her and doubted her expertise. My new doctor is much easier to talk to but one must be on one's toes when meeting with him. All-in-all I find it much easier to talk to him. Sometimes I have to ask for clarification as to the why or details but he will usually explain things to my satisfaction.
-1	My doctor frequently overbooks his appointments so I don't always feel that I have his full attention.
-1	I distrust my doctor sometimes because I think she is more concerned with saving the VA hospital money by delaying my treatment . I trust her because at times she goes to bat for me sometimes .
-1	i trust my family doctor because no matter what a hurry he is in he will sit and explain everything to me 
1	I have had the same doctor for several years and have had no problems. I know what all my conditions are and she explains everything I need to know
1	He spends the time needed to answer all my questions. He is respectful and kind. The office staff reminds me of my appointments.
-1	Seems to have too much on with practices in 2 locations and not effective support to make me feel 100% trusting.. Feels a little disorganized
-1	I've had Dr Flores for over 4 years and she knows me pretty well. She is a Christian doctor and tries to get things through to me so I will heal better.
1	He spends alot of time with me & is very thorough & explains everything. He takes the time to listen to me.
1	I trust my doctor to know what is best for my health all the time but sometimes i feel that I know my body better and can sometimes make a better decision than the doctor in some occassions.
1	I've been seeing my doctor for years now and I trust my doctor. My doctor knows almost everything about me and my conditions. She is honest and straight forward to me about my conditions.

-1	they never call as needed or when i ask them to disreragrd my messages all together. never return my calls
-1	I don't always trust my Dr. I think he tell me one thing and somebody else another.I feel he does this because he afraid he's going to upset me or scare me
1	my doctor has always been very friendly and helpful with anything regarding my health. he is always so understanding and nice that i always feel comfortable and well informed.
1	My doctor spends time with me and also is thorough  He is good with making patients feel comfortable and also it detailed
-1	I trust my doctor completely and she helps me understand and goes out of her way to help and explain my medical situation with her.
1	No I can not explain any of this. It's just how I feel about this subject. It's difficult for me to express my thoughts in writing.
-1	Doctors only alot a certain amount of time for each patient (not long enough) causing them to rush through your visit with very little time to explain what's wrong with you let alone explain different procedures or treatment options.  Doctors also almost always jump to a pill, or a test or a procedure rather than trying a more down to earth, logical approach.
-1	Overall I do trust most health care professionals. but my only contact with health care is going to the Dentist twice a year and seeing the Eye Doctor about once every 3 or 4 years
1	My doctor that I see most often is an extremely intelligent and interesting person. We have talked on many subjects over the years. I trust him to treat me in the best possible way for my situation at the time. He is very personable and open to discuss whatever is on your mind.
-1	In my experience my doctor only gives bad news or the worst of what can happen. He dosnt give you any hope in healing things or being able to fi anything
-1	the last few doctors i have seen are quick and dismissive and none has got it right.   I was sent home to get dandruff shampoo when it is excema.  i was sent home with a surgeons number when i had a gall bladder attack that i have managed on my own
-1	I have been given no reason to distrust my current physician. She is thorough even though it is difficult to get in to see her.
-1	It depends on the individual personality of the physician, which can vary widely just like individuals in other professions.
-1	He has always done what is best for me, and I trust his decisions and opinions.  I've had health issues, and he has helped me.
1	He is quite professional, well schooled and has good office technology.  He can be reached online and someone always answers phone.
-1	i trust my doctor,it is the insurance cos. that i don't.They are in charge and make the rules they want.That is the framework drs. function within.A tratment must be insurance approved or you won't get it.
1	I really like my primary doctor and while I trust that my health is important and he is very easy to talk to, he doesn't explore some things as much as I think he should and I have to insist on him doing so if I think he's not understanding the severity of an issue. He does not truly understand me as well as my previous primary care doctor so can be quick to dismiss something that I know needs more attention.
-1	I basically trust doctors to do the right thing...but I make sure to research or learn more about a treatment or medicine if it is prescribed for me before I do anything blindly
-1	My physician is very thorough and takes considerable time with me when I see him for an appointment.  He takes extra time to research the proper course of action.
1	It at all will be the same way of furture and it will be the same way the sun will work and ur sun and the best way to come though and it was the same way to become true and it way   
1	He knows more about medical conditions than I do. He has years of education in the medical field and I would only know what I can find in books, searching on medical websites for information and from asking other people about medical conditions.
1	She has done a great job for 20 years and takes her time to explain things.  She listens to my concerns and has good advise
1	I have known my doctor for quite a few years and completely trust her with all my medical needs. She knows what is best for me and what I need to do to feel good 
1	He genuinely is concerned about me. He talks to me about every day things that are going on.  Asks me about my job,  my home, my personal life. 
1	I have been going to the same primary doctor for decades, have gotten good advice, and good treatment, that whole time, and have built up trust in her opinions.
-1	Happily I've not had serious medical problems requiring decision making or second opinions.   My PCP is a kind but busy man and I do feel strongly that if I do develop a serious issue he might not be the best care giver. 
-1	I do not totally depend on my physician to always know what is best for me.  I take his diagnosis seriously, but will tailor the course of treatment to better suit my needs if necessary.
-1	All Dr,s first must consider the likelihood that a male practice law suit could be filed against them. I personally trust my primary care physician as she has been up forward with me about all my conditions and or complaints.
1	I have never had a reason to distrust my physician.  I most often go to see the physician assistant, and have trust in her as well.
-1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to the same one since I was a teenager and my doctor understands me. My doctor knows everything about me and I don't want to go through getting to know a new doctor.
-1	My pop suggests non prescription processes initially. Fights email, he may opt for writing a prescription.ifi have a questionable side effect from a specific med., he will stop fora few days, possibly terry before changing medication. All in combination with healthy diet and excercise
-1	My former physician has made the best decisions about my medical care based on the tests and my answers to his questions.
1	"For my primary care physician I reserve time to meet with the doctor to discuss my health care plan to see if we can have a honest and open relationship in managing my health. I would not continue to see a physician that did not have time to discuss my health, ensure all my questions and concerns are addressed, and ever said to me ""you wouldn't understand or just do as I say"". Health care is a team effort between the patient, family members, and care Providers."
-1	I only will trust a doctor who believes in God, I find this to be very important in how they handle situations
-1	Distrust, new doctor, don't know much about them. Trust, makes me feel comfortable feels like they listen to my consernes. 
-1	Established patient for many years.  Doctor also has a good reputation in the community.  Primary care physician for all of my immediate family members as well as my siblings and their families.
1	My primary care physician is very through and takes the time to listen to me and explain any options.   
1	Because my doctor is a very professional and well prepared person who knows the area in which I am currently treated.

1	I have had the same doctor for 30 years and though I see him only 1 or 2 times a year I feel he is there when I need him. He has taken good care of me  thru any illness I have had.
-1	I have no insurance,so dr visits aren't often,some drs are great,others seemed rushed to get to next patient
1	I have a doctor who is an older gentleman and he is very caring and thorough with me.  He talks to me, not at me and that gives me a comfortable feeling about him.
1	I have been seeing my doctor for about 15 years and continue to be impressed with his empathy and competence. He has been voted one of the top Internists in our city year after year and he is very well respected in the medical community.
-1	I think the vast majority of doctors have the patient's best interests at heart, but occasionally they may push for a certain treatment or medication for political reasons.
1	I have been under the care of my primary physician for over 10 years and I have complete trust and faith in him and his clinic staff.
-1	I trust doctors they have the knowledge to help me I don't have myself they went to school to learn about medical procedures I didnt
1	My doctor has been very good to me, he has greatly helped my diabetes get better, heart, back, knee problems, we can discuss which drugs to use,I have many allergies
-1	I have a personal care physician that generally is interested in the problem and is willing to offer suggestions or solutions,  For the most part I simply go to the doctor about every 3 months for her opinion if I need to do anything in particular.
-1	I have not had very good luck with doctors and have been sent miles away to get care or have had to see multiple providers
-1	I have not been to a doctor or care physician in many many years because I am way to anxious to do so 
-1	I had a doctor to whom I gave 100% trust because he earned it. Now that I have that person as a comparison, my current doctor falls well short in knowledge and patient advocacy.
1	I would trust her with my life she has always been completely open wiyh me about everything that is wrong
-1	too big a hurry to fully listen to what Im describing.. wants his job to be much quicker and easier while still making alot of money.
-1	My physician takes the time to thoroughly explain procedures & health care information.  I can trust him 
-1	 i trust or distrust your primary care physician because he is good and stuff like that and its easy to talk to them openly about everything you need to talk to a doctor about in a situation
1	In 2013 I moved and got a new primary care doctor.  Within a three month period I broke 4 bones in my foot and had to be hospitalized for a severe intestinal problem.  My doctor took the time to explain all options to me and followed up with me to make sure I was doing well.
1	I trust my doctor because he has a lot of experience in what he does. He listens to what you have to say and then from a medical stand point he lets you know what he feels is appropriate.
-1	he knows my health condition adn also take care of all my allergies very well. he knows my food habits and also suggest nutritions. he speaks really well
-1	He works WITH me and asks me questions and gives me a voice in my care. He used to ask if I was ready to discontinue a certain medication, but when I finally explained why I wanted to continue it, he understood and stopped asking. 
1	I have had the same Doctor for 15 years and she has never been wrong and always tells me the truth so I trust her.
-1	I have a very good connection with my healthcare provider. I trust him very much. i am not worried at all.
-1	I don't trust the medical system or any doctor for much of anything.  They very often do more harm than good.
-1	Well I do not have a specific primary care physician, so as far as having a level of trust or distrust for one, it is not possible.
1	I know my doctor well, and have considerable experience with him and his methods.I trust him to keep me informed about my health issues.
-1	I generally trust my doctor. He, unlike many doctors, is actually interested in what he does. He is still human, and I challenge him when I feel the need. He doesn't mind, it makes him think.
-1	I have a genuine trust in doctors for the simple fact a doctor's isn't afforded mistakes. If a health care provider makes an occupational they could possibly be subjected to legal ramifications.
-1	I trust my doctor mostly but sometimes she can seem a little cocky. That concerns me because she doesn't think she is capable of mistakes.
-1	He has been my physician for several years.  I have never had a problem with his treatment plans.  He is willing to bring in a specialist when it is warranted.  I am confident in his care.
-1	I  prefer to research on my own but you in general need to trust primary care physician and believe that he is doing good for you
1	He seemed legitimately interested in now i felt and what u needed from him. He didn't brush me aside or tell me to make another appointment when I had more than one issue to attend to.
-1	I have only seen my current physicians once or twice.  All of my long time physicians have retired from practice and I now have no physician that I've known, or been treated by, for a length of time.  
-1	I don't know her well yet, and I've only seen her three times. Also, I prefer natural medicine when possible, which medical doctors tend to stay away from. 
-1	I trust that my primary care physician will provide me with the accurate info regarding my well being in regards with what's diagnosed.
-1	My doctor comes to my home for our visits because i can talk with her in a more friendly atmosphere then an office visit Which i feel i get to know her better and able to trust her more 
-1	I trust my doctors for the most part; however, they are not God.  They make mistakes, get tired, and have lives like the rest of us.  I believe in second opinions and self educating.  
-1	They push medicine at me and don't look at me as a whole person so just address symptoms as separate.
1	Although I do generally trust my doctor there are times when I feel I am seen as a patient and other times when I feel I am seen like one more hurdle the doctor has to get through before his work day is done. Sometimes it seems it is a quick examination and a treatment and throw me out the door. 
-1	I have great faith in our medical staff, resources and facilities here in the swell state of Washington.
-1	I am still new to going to the doctor and entrusting them with my illnesses and overall care. I am attempting to get the doctor to understand.
-1	There is never enough time and he is always running late. I wish he would be on time and listen to my issues.
-1	They are in and out seeing in real quick, prescribe a medicine that costs an arm and a leg and come back in 4-6 weeks. And rumor has it, the doctors get a kick back from drug companies for drugs they prescribe. And they also schedule 8-12 patients at once so all patients wait and wait some more, frustrating yes
1	I trust my primary care Doctor to take the best care of me. Primary Care Doctors take as an oath to provide the best care. Primary Care Doctors want a good reputation. Primary Care Doctors have great mal practice insurance.
1	She has been my physician for many years and has always looked out for my best interests. I have full confidence.
-1	Because they get paid when you fill out a prescription they wrote.  The more prescriptions they write and you fill, the more they make.
1	The main reason I trust my doctor is that I have been going to him for many years for yearly check ups and other medical attention and over time I have discovered that his diagnosis is generally correct and that he has my best interests at heart. 
1	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because he really looks out for my well being he understands that I have a 6 year old and he wants me to be around until she is grown.
1	My Doctor is from our community and goes to our local church. She has a daughter also that is one of our best EMTs locally. She also doesn't care about if you can pay her right away. 
-1	Too many doctors who practice western style medicine are not willing to accept the benefits traditional Chinese medicine, like acupuncture and herbs. 
1	I trust doctors until I find out they are wrong. So far all my doctors have treated me well and never been wrong.
-1	I have been going to see him for about 10 years and he seems to do right by me I can't really say what things he has done wrong as he seems to do me good..
1	My primary care physician has been very good for me and too me. I have been going to her since my last doctor retired. The doctors that she refer me to are the one's that she trust with the care of her family members and herself. She is also an affiliate in one of the best hospitals in my area.
1	My doctor is trained in the medical field and I am not. He also faces malpractice if he does not treat me reasonably or does something outside conventional treatments 
-1	I do not have a primary physician, however I rely on my sister, who is a physician, for all things medical. I don't always follow her advice, but I do listen and ask the appropriate questions before making my own decisions. However, I know many, many doctors and don't trust a great deal of them to have the patient's best interest at heart. Sometimes they are lazy. Sometimes they are condescending. Sometimes the amount of money they'll receive from the patient's insurance/pockets matters the most.
-1	Sometimes I feel like my primary care physician only wants to hurry up and move onto the next patient.
1	"I do believe in being informed, myself, but at the end of the day, for some things, one has to trust an ""expert"" - I feel that picking a doctor is hard. But once you have picked a doctor you feel you can trust, then you should trust them."
1	i trust them because I have known them for a long time and they have done very well by me, he listens to me and lets me talk and give my opinions
-1	He seems like  a  good  person  hope  I can  keep  this one longer then a year  I hope  all goes  well  with  this  doctor  
-1	because they just  care about how much money they can get from I have had to make the decision for like chorlesterol meds
-1	i know how doctors get kick backs for prescribing certain medications and although I do like my doctor, I still don't trust that they always have my best interests in mind. 
-1	I trust most doctors but I have had a few that seemed like I was just another number and just tell you something to get you in and out quickly
-1	I do trust my doctor but not doctors in general. Many are only looking after themselves and do not have the patient's best interest at heart. I will not stay with a doctor I think is doing that.
-1	They are there to do a job and I think doctors want to help so they always try to do their best and sometimes they are wrong you have to look to yourself to help too
1	i have known him for a long time and he is honest and dependable to a fault.  he is always clear and concise in his diagnoses and instructions for treatment.
-1	I trust my doctor. I have never had a problem. They have always been nice and made me feel comfortable. 
-1	My Father was killed by is Dr.  My Mother was killed by a Hospital.  Dr's in America are trained to prescribe Pills, not cure the ill.  I have a primary care physician, but I take charge of my health.  I am 70 years old and take no prescription drugs.
1	He takes the time to listen to me.  I am comfortable talking to him and he answers any questions in a senseable way. He also suggests more economical a alternative options instead of just drugs. 
-1	They are always rushing and not receptive to questions.  They seem to be overbooking for the money.  I think ultimately it's my responsibility to take care of myself so I don't blame them in my mind.
1	I have been going to him for many years and he has always been right about his diagnosis. If he does not know the answer to something then he will recommend I go to a specialist.
1	my doctor is up on everything as he goes to conference. He also knows pharmacolical answersMy daughter who is the hospital CFO recommended him.
-1	My doctor is great he listens to me and my needs.  Along with his nurses and communicated very well with my concerns.
1	I really like my doctor. She is very thorough and friendly. Always has done the right thing. Very patient and listens to me. Never have doubted her.
1	i have faith in my dr.i've been seeing her for a long time & believe she has done a good job at keeping me well and healthy. she is up on all of the latest medical problems and treatments. i feel safe in her hands
1	i do trust my doctor to tell me about my health an what better I can do to help myself an the things I should do
-1	My doctor doesnt seem to be quick to prescribe medication, answers all my questions, is calm, doesnt seem to be in a hurry to move on to the next patient. Makes me feel confident in his ability.  
1	I have went to the same doctor for a number of years and he has always listens to the questions I have. For example, if I need additional blood work or tests, he explains why this is necessary and what he is looking for. I trust his judgment and am appreciative of his care and concern.
1	I like my doctor and trust him, he is caring and thoughtful of me and my needs I would not change doctors, I will continue seeing him
-1	had personally bad experiences with doctors in regards to making/performing good decisions, seems to be more out to make money than helping patients
-1	I believe doctors are generally there to help you, not hurt or deceive you. They are looking to make you feel better as that is my most people go into the medical field.
-1	Have only seen him 2x but he seems nice and  seemed to know what he he doing, more than willing to,set up appointments for me with other hwpealthcare specialists
1	he-she has my general helth and well benning in mind so I have to trust that what do for me will be the right thing for me 
1	Been with my doctor for many years. When he thought something on my leg looked like could be skin cancer, he didn't wait, he called a dermatologist right away and sent me right over to have it checked.  Sure enough it was skin cancer.
1	I have had many Drs over the years, I have 3 right now, and I trust them all very much. They talk to me about what is being done or what I should do to do better. 
-1	"First, I want to say that it's very hard to rate the sentence ""all in all you have complete trust in your doctor"" on a sliding scale. The sentence contains an absolute, so it's not clear. Next, to sum up how much I trust my doctor, I'd say I generally trust her, and I think that she's a competent person with good intentions, but that she also has a reasonable amount of self-interest and might not be above soft-selling me something I don't really need, like botox. I don't think that she would lie to me about it, though. She has a fairly conservative point of view about prescribing medications and I appreciate that."
1	This is the person I rely on for the truth more so than anyone else besides my family. These are the people that try to keep us alive.
-1	I think that most doctors are basically helpful.  They do tend to be arrogant and think that they are important.  No doctor wants to be sued for malpractice, so I think they tend to over treat many medical conditions.
1	I trust my doctor with my healthcare needs because of his knowledge, compassion and care for my well being.
1	I trust my doctor because I've been with him for years, and through those years, I've become healthier and happier by following his advice. I was overweight and unhealthy just a couple years back, and because of a healthy routine prescribed by my doctor, I've shed pounds and am much healthier today.
-1	my doctors always explain all the side effects of all the different medications that are planned to be taken by me and they will answer all questions i have to the best of there nowledge
1	I trust my primary care physician's knowledge, in that has been able to direct me in the right path of medical care for several years. She has directed me to specialists whom I have found to be great doctors. She is very knowledgeable--a specialist, in fact--in the area of breast cancer, which is of special concern to me because of my family history. She takes plenty of time to ask and answer questions at each visit.
1	He is a kind, compassionate man who always takes time to explain in detail what should be done and how it will be done. He always takes time to explain everything in detail.
1	It comes from experience. he is very honest and explains everything. I don't know what else you want to know
-1	I trust my primary care doctor - overwise I would have change my doctor immediately. No reason to visit doctor I cannot trust.
-1	Doctors have operated on me and have messed their operations,therefore,I do not have much trust in doctors !!!
1	He has been my doctor through cancer and other maladies for 20 years. He is very modest and gentle. He has found problems with my health that I was not aware of, such as pneumonia.
-1	i like my doctor but sometimes i just do not know what to think about things they have help out a lot over the years
-1	I believe my physician mostly cares about his patients, including me. Any problems I have with him stem from his reliance on a completely helpless and unintelligent staff.
-1	I have general trust as he has been working for many years and has usually fixed my ailments. However, I do feel that he is getting lazier as he nears retirement and sometimes wonder if he suggests medications due to relationships he has with pharmaceutical companies.
-1	sometimes I think they take things out of control because everyone body is different and sometimes the things they said we should be taking it ends up making us worst or bad 
1	I have had the same physician for several years. He is patient with my many questions. He is easily accessible. 
1	I have been with my doctor for 28 years he has never steered mee wrong  I haav aalwa trusted him to do what is right for me and he has never let me down.  Always  on my side not his.
-1	I have been seeing my doctor for several years and have established a trust and confidence in his ability and diagnosis
1	I don't know, I just trust her. Maybe because she is friendly or maybe it was the time she didn't know something and consulted her colleague while I was there. I just feel that I can trust her.
-1	Being given conflicting information then the denial, can never simply admit being human and making a mistake
1	She is very good at what she dose and she know what she dose and tell u what is wrong and is very understanding and talk to u
-1	My primary care doctor works for the Dept Of Veterans Affairs, I truly believe he has the best interest of the VA not me.
-1	i do trust my primary care doctors thats the way it is and i do believe they are doing their best to help and assist as in our condition and they are knowledgeable enough to just do what is the best for us 
1	goes in depth with our discussions, goes the extra step when preliminary tests are not within the appropriate range, explains actions and my consent before adjusting meds or recommending actions
1	I trust him because he has been one of my doctor's for 15 years and knows my medical history. He bases decisions on my history.
-1	I trust my Dr because she is very honest with me. She tells me what she thinks is the best situation for me regarding my diabetes. We also talk about family. I know she is married to another Dr, and they have 2 boys. I broke my fibula last year, and she was very honest with me regarding the healing process with my leg. I took about 10 months to heal, and I sometimes still have pain. She told me I will probably have pain on and off for the rest of my life. diabetes and my age are factors in the slow healing.
-1	I don't feel they go the extra mile to check for any ailments I feel they are in a rush and don't check for everything they could sometimes we have to offer suggestions which is not cool 
1	do not have a primary doctor, but I feel that doctors are desensitized to the health concerns of their patients
-1	I trust him but there is always that doubt that they are just guessing your diagnosed things because they are doctor
1	Well let's see. So far my Doctor hasn't led me astray yet. He has told me to lose some weight, but I think he knows that isn't going to happen anytime soon. When we have a problem, he is willing to work on it to figure out what is going on.
1	I do my research before choosing a doctor. I also go off of word of mouth and trust my doctor completely because of the people who recommended hi and my faith. 
1	Doctors take pride in their skills. I trust them to want to be right. Being dishonest would be a conflict but we all have convenience concerns. 
-1	I trust my doctor she listens to my feelings & also listens to me regarding my concerns about certain medications 
-1	I believe that my primary care physician has my best health thoughts in mind and would not lead me in a direction that would be bad for me
-1	I will never trust a physician because they are just doing their job as an employee and dont genuinely care about you personally. They do what they are trained is best for their career, not for you.
1	I trust my primary care physician, but sometimes I don't feel like we could do be everything that we should be doing to make me feel better.
1	I am able to reach my  physician by e mail or phone and get a reply back in a timely manner if it is needed. They are helpful in keeping any RX's refilled and providing me with the results of my tests along with any recommendations. 
-1	Sometimes, doctors are pressured into prescribing their patients with medication they really don't need. So, some doctors are honest and are straight-forward with their patients and some aren't. 
-1	Because they provide me with the best decisions for my health and body. Both physically and mentally 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because she is very kind and compassionate and always discusses all treatment options to understand what is best for me.
-1	I feel like a couple of health issues that I have had to deal with have been belittled or downplayed when talking to my doctor
1	my  primary care physician always show interest in my concerns and totally honest in telling me about all of the different treatment options available for my condition. All in all, i completely trust my doctor's decisions on which medical treatments are best for me.
-1	I trust the doctors I have seen because they have spent time listening to me and fully answering my questions.
-1	My new doctors seem to be very knowledgeable and intent upon learning all about me. I am not too sure if I agree with the judgement that I should stop taking metformin (which I have been taking for over 12 years) because I am over medicating because my A1C is below 7 (6.2) and they seem more worried about my blood pressure than anything else.
-1	I think they are more into there own money earning then into really helpping me out with my needs. They do help in the way they tell me but with the other needs I need I have to find out my own information since they dont offer it and I think they should give that information also
-1	I trust my primary care physician because ethey know me and my health history not to mention they also know my families health istory
-1	He has never held back on what he thinks is best for me. He speaks plainly and bluntly about what I need to help me get over my conditions if that is something that can be done. He does not play games or go easy on my feelings he tells it like it is. I like a doctor who gets to the point and gives me the bad and good without trying to downplay how bad something is. 
1	I have spent a lot of time over the years finding a woman's doctor oh finally on the third doctor in about six years I found a doctor that I really like. I trust her a lot and I believe that she gives me her honest opinion on things,  she will leave and go out of her way to tell me practices that used to be performed which are as widely practiced anymore. Myother main doctor is for my sleep condition. I've been going to see him for over year and I trust his guidance as well. 
1	I fully trust my physician, I've been going to him for years! He is thorough during my visits, he tries treating disorders/illnesses/conditions without medication first, then if that doesn't work he will prescribe medication. He is totally honest and informative!
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and to listen to me. She asks me questions pertaining to the situation and is thorough in explaining what her opinion is. 
-1	I feel my doctor completes the bare minimum required of her because I have state insurance so I pat nothing out of pocket for her time, which is as short as she will make it.
1	There is a high level of mutual respect and regard between my medical team and me.  We all recognize that honest, complete  commucation is essential for them to provide me with the best care.  If I question a particular treatment, they are completely willing to discuss the pros, cons, and options for the optimal outcome.
-1	Very young dr. I am new to practice. She has me on expensive mess that I cannot afford. This causes me stress and anxiety 
-1	My doctor doesn't thoroughly talk about any diagnosis. My doctor also seems to always be in rush. I appreciate though that my doctor does seem to take an interest in being there and providing steps.
-1	My doctor is getting old a d is probably ready to retire.  Its time to find a new dr but im not one for change
1	Just general anxiety from test results. The people I deal with are all very good and do all they can to make me more relaxed. 
-1	Doctors are just people. Some good, some not so good. I believe todays doctors are overworked and do not have enough time to spend quality time with individual patients.
1	 I trust my primary doctor. He has been my doctor for over 20 years. Even when I was away for several years he remembered me and what condition I was suffering from 15 years ago.
-1	I am somewhat distrustful because of a misdiagnose of one of my children in childhood. It delayed his recovery and caused hospitalization that was not necessary.  I believe you have to be your own advocate.
-1	It all depends on (1) the doctor (2) the city (3) the facility (4) my personal experience. Some doctors (like the one I have now) I trust 100%. Others in the past? Skeptical.
-1	I think that I'm just a number and he just wants to me get in and out as soon as possible. I don't think that he really cares about me at all and I'm just a paycheck
1	Doctor takes the time to explore any and all problems. Gives the benefit of his knowledge. Never hurries an exam.
1	She maybe be running behind but she never acts like she  is rushing through my appointments.Take the time to answer questions and explain the best treatment for me.  
-1	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I have had a couple of bad experiences with doctors in the past.  Doctors are humans and humans make mistakes.  My last primary care physician didn't listen to my daughters symptoms and the next day, she was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis.  I never went back to him .  (She won't either. )
-1	He is always to quick to put me on a pill. Does not want to listen to what my contribute to what is going on. Rushes me out the door.
1	Have a new doctor, she seems to understand my medical conditions and prescribes prescriptions for them. I do/have to trust her for prescribing new prescriptions, or taking some of them away when no longer useful.
1	based upon past experiences, I believe he is thorough and has my needs at heart.  If I have questions, he answers without hesitation.  We discuss the issues.  I never feel rushed.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician - I see numerous different doctors in a charity clinic setting.  Some of these doctors I trust as they have a good bedside manner and are clear in their instructions and information.  Others are lacking in bedside manner and seem cold and impersonal, with little care about explanations or answering questions or concerns.
-1	medications are mostly prescribed based off what pharmaceutical reps are pushing, right? So whatever medication I get may not be what the doctor would have preferred to give. 
-1	I think they have your best interests in mind. I do not expect them to do any harm. Also they are well educated and worked hard to get to where they are 
-1	most doctors have so many patients to see that they take too little time thoroughly listening to your problems
1	I trust my physician because he or she knows the best in health and will tell their opinion based on knowledge.
1	I've been to many doctors but my current Doctor is very nice and explains everything in a Manor I can understand and is always on time and doesn't keep me waiting
-1	Doctor has seen me and my family through loss, illness and family ifficulties. He has always weighed the options to get us any help or medications we have needed
1	They tell me the things that I have to do and not to do to be healthy. They don't beat around the bush, they tell me if something is wrong with me.
1	I haven't had any problems with following instructions from any of them for the last five years,and I've had a few medical procedures done.
-1	I think doctors usually try to give the best care possible, although sometimes there may be other options available.
-1	My doctor is a good doctor but rather conventional and not always open to some of my suggestions.  I am very chronically ill and in constant pain but he refuses to allow me to use medicinal cannabis although it is legal in my state.
1	I feel like my doctor provides me with all the options available for me and helps me decide on the best course of action for myself. she takes the time to explain all options I may have access to
-1	I trust my priamary care because I have seen her for many years and has always taken good care of me
-1	I believe I bring with me an army of negative people.  It has been this way for over ten years.  Without me these people get nothing.  It is difficult for me to focus on my life when so much of it revolves around other people.  Of course the only evidence to me is going from a grade a student to homeless and unemployed.  Like I set that goal for myself.  I find life gives me the opposite of what I ask for.  However due to current small successes I am beginning to change my opinion and that I believe will also change my homelessness.  That being said people who set out to help me find they now become part of this negative crowd's aggressiveness.  Who to blame but me.  There is no evidence.  It's about a person's attitude and their true intentions.  I trust my helpers to make informed decisions according to their god given abilities and people given authorities.  The second amendment.  The fifth amendment.  To defend the first.
1	the advise given to me so far has proven to be right on target as to fixing a few minor problems , results have been very good, feeling much better
-1	My primary physician has all the best intentions and is a very nice person. I like him personally but he has misdiagnosed me on two different occasions and this has had a negative impact on my trust level.  
-1	THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAS LITTLE OR NO TRAINING IN NUTRITION AND RELIES ON PHARMACEUTICAL POISON TO FIX AN ISSUE.
1	I don't have any reason not to. My parents and a couple of my friends go to the same practice and I know they all like it there as well. 
1	education, experience and no obvious profit motive. if I didn't trust my doctor I'd find another. Part of an hmo.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never steered me in the wrong direction.  I have had this same doctor for several years.
-1	I trust my primary care doctor.  I know enough to keep myself and others safe.  He is somewhat lackluster in touching and doing needed tests.
-1	to be honest I have really never trusted doctors  but the doctor I have I trust him sometimes I have my doubts about him but he really seems to know what he is doing and I guess I trust him more than I would any other doctor 
-1	Doctors can be trusted but sometimes I feel they prescribe medications because they get a kickback whenever a patient buys a prescription for a medication they have written a prescription for. I feel that there are alternative solutions for some medical problems that will work just as well.
1	he was able to get me better when I was si ill and he told me what was going on  with my body and every thing he has told me had help me get better
-1	I've only been to her one time but she was very nice and listen to what I said but didn't seem to do much of an examination but it was just an initial first time visit
-1	Some times it's as if some doctors need someone to experiment on. Some don't even know how to diagnose correctly. Very skeptical about making appointments or even going to the emergency room because of it.
1	Have been seeing them for a long time , and have a lot of confidence in them .When something works I tend to leave my t alone 
-1	i always trust our primary care physician, they are always helpful and always consider my wants and needs.
-1	I feel that I trust my doctor when they do checkups on me and then review my test results and such, i trust their judgement
1	i have him for over 30 years and he has always take great care of me and my family. seen me through a lot
1	I trust my doctor. He is kind and caring. He takes plenty of time to listen to my concerns and responds appropriately.
-1	she's good at most stuff but doesn't believe that certain conditions exist or that treatment not conventional would be helpful.  but she does listen pretty well and has quickly diagnosed some critical problems so she's a keeper.
1	She has been very thorough and asks questions about me personally we have a good relationship she checks me out 
-1	The doctor does his best but must be a good listener and read between the words to understand me and be a good judge of what will work a long time.
-1	"He is often in a hurry to get to the next patient and does a poor job of explaining my condition/medication and shows no sympathy.  Just because someone is a ""doctor"" does not mean they are any good.  "
-1	my doctor does not tell me choices I need to figure out the options that I can choose from.  I have side effects
-1	Pharmaceutical companies, among others, have changed how doctors conduct their business and it has not changed to benefit the patient.
1	My doctor is pretty thorough in treatment options. She sat with me for 30 minutes discussing different types of medications I could take for a related health problem.
-1	cant really say without having a doctorso how can i answer that it would be like playing a guessing game but guess in life it goes both ways
1	I trust this person to provide me with the medications I need to live a long healthy life. Even though they may reccomend a more expensive option for their benefit.
1	My primary physician always explains in great detail all information that I need to take care of any medical condition I might be having
-1	we can not afford to use a doctor under todays healthcare costs. we pay 600 a month for 2 people our deductible is 8 to 12 thousand before any on will agree to even see us. 
-1	my primary care physician will tell me I need to take a drug instead of offering something natural to help me. I really try to avoid drugs. I don't completly trust that taking drugs is always the best answer
-1	I go to a DO rather than an MD. I think she looks at my health more holistically than a regular MD who looks for what they can prescribe to fix the problem. She asks about other things that may be impacting the issue rather than just writing an Rx.
1	I tust my physician.He always takes plenty of time to examine me and talk to me about all my conditions. He also always ask how my medicines are working.Explains any new medications that may be available to try.
1	I trust my doctor in every way he treats me-with drugs that I need and the confidence I have in him in what we talk about
1	Because they have good heart and care alot to help people and check there health to make sure there healthy and wants people to live longer and have happy family and friends and have a careersâ they want and doctor save people life because they care about people and there not sick and just want us to live longer and have a Happy life and having fun with family and friends too and we are human being and do want to live longer and have family and friends too 
1	"My doc. is a very caring and compassionate person, he gives my all the time I need to discuss questions and concerns I may have, he has great ""bedside manners"". He always takes an interest in me and my health."
1	My Dr. and I converse quite easily and neither of us is shy nor adverse to talking about my health and habits whether good or bad.
1	i have been seeing my doctor for twenty year now. i trust her with my health and my hubbys health.she takes the time to listen to us. and explains treatment plans to us until we under.she sends us to a specialist if need. she finds the best medicine and treatment for our condictions.
-1	"I have little trust in anyone. When I ""trust"" it is because I believe it is possible for there to be a better nature of a situation and person, but I believe for the most part people are liars, or truth benders, or they just don't say everything they should, even if they don't lie. It is complicated. All I know is that I do not fully trust anyone, well... I kinda... it is complicated. Anytime I fully opened up to someone and let my guard down they crushed me. So, I keep my guard up always, and trust so litle I barely trust myself, but I try to trust medical professionals as much as I can, I am getting better at it."
-1	"I know multiple cases of healthcare providers that pressure doctors to perform ""low risk"" treatments that have ultimately harmed their patient in the long run until     their insurance ran out. This is an issue with insurance companies, however the medical profession seems to be tied with them on some level."
1	My current physician seems trustworthy and has given me good recommendations to improve my everyday health which have been working. 
-1	Its been quite a while since I seen my Dr. We moved and I havent found a personal dr. If we are in need of medical care we go to  instacare, I have found them to be knowledgeable and helpful, as if our family dr. Really good to explain.  I trust them both.
-1	My primary care physician is part of a large group. I feel my appointments are sometimes rushed, that I get certain tests because of age or other reasons, not because it's warranted. It feels like a 'doctor shop' without personalized attention. The specialist I see often cites outdated information, and doesn't seem to listen to my issues
-1	I feel that she is too busy , pressured to not spend enough time. She frequently refers me to a specialist so that my medical information is scattered
-1	They have been my primary care doctor for years.  My doctor is careing and usually takes time to listen to me.  She has been able to help me with most problems and trusts me as a patient.  She also has been a doctor to most of my family for years and knows my history.
1	While I am intelligent and know what is best for me and my lifestyle,  I value her education and experience in the health care system. 
1	My dr sits down and goes into detail answering my question and explaining any new medication she is giving me.
-1	I have issues with doctors telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They think that they are more than God. 
-1	My doctor has always taken the necessary time to go over any questions or concerns I may have, even if that meant she was going into her next scheduled appointment late
1	My doctor takes her time when I am there as though I am her only patient.  She asks questions and she makes sure she understand my symptoms and concerns.
1	I have been seeing the same doctor for 15 years.  I find him very trustworthy and have never had a problem with anything he has said.
-1	I begin researching and then trusting. I rely on their experience and track record. I consider my visits and then form an opinion.
1	I have had the same Dr. for a lot of years .He is alwys nice ,explains everything in detail for me .He is very kind and thoughtful.
1	I trust my physician because he is a Christian. He is always up beat and nice to me. He knows my health condition and treats me accordingly. 
-1	His office is extremely busy, seeing patients every 15 min. or so.  So times I don't feel we've solved a particular issue I'm having.  They are also very lax at getting  paperwork done in a timely manner sometimes...I feel like I need to stay on top of things there.
-1	I really don't put a lot of trust in doctors as there are many who will prescribe medications that may not be necessary in order to get the bonuses drug companies offer to promote their drugs.  I prefer doctors that will consider alternative or natural medication
-1	HE LISTENS TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING MY TYPE 2 DIABETES OR OTHER CONDITION I MAY HAVE.  IF I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING HE SAYS HE TAKES THE TIME TO ANSWER THEM RATHER THAN PUTTING ME OFF WITH A HALF ASSED ANSWER BUT RATHER GIVES A THOUGHTFUL ANSWER IN TERMS I CAN UNDERSTAND RATHER THEN SAYING THINGS I NEED A MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTAND.  THIS GOES FOR MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN MY UROLOGIST AND MY ENDOCRONOLOGIST 
-1	I don't distrust my primary physician, he just doesn't completely understand how to handle my current condition. He tends to defer to my other doctors, who I don't trust much at all. 
1	several years experience with her - openness to questions, takes time to explain things, honors my decisions
1	My physician is caring and empathetic. She doesn't talk down to me when she is explainging or answering a question. She is thorough and takes her time. 
1	My physician is a problem solver who looks at variables and offers options to deal with the issue. She then let's me make the final decision.
-1	My doctor is opened minded, listens, cares about my overall well being and want whats best for my health.
-1	i usually don't trust doctors in the hospitals close to me, since i don't have a personal physician. for some reason most doctors that i have interacted with in nyc always seem so distant and not caring of whats going on in your life, especially when it comes to your physical health
1	She has always treated with respect. Explained her answers to questions I had about my health in terms I could understand
-1	Because they think they know everything and they dont. We are not at the brink of medical technology. They still dont have a cure for the common cold.
1	In regards to Doctors in general, based on my families experience, they were very reliable.They benefited (my family) On the judgement of the Physicisn
1	My doctor is non- judgmental and honest. She even shares stories about her in college so she seems relatable.
-1	I trust my physician to have knowledge but i distrust because in my experience in life, 3 physcians will have different opinions on treatment.
-1	I trust my doctor to make the right decisions based on their training and knowledge but doctors are human and still make mistakes
1	He listens to me, takes time to listen to my concerns and I feel like he tries to do the best he possibly can for my health problems.
-1	i feel he had lack of interest in me sometimes and rushes me and also does not have the answers i need to help
-1	My doctor is my friend as well as my doctor. I feel I can trust what advice she gives me most times, or at least I hope so. I am very comfortable with my doctor
-1	My doctor is caring and compassionate to say the least. They have my back at all times and i appreciate it very much
-1	I trust My Doctor To give Me The Required Information For Any Medical Question s That I Might Have at the time
-1	I feel to believe, my primary care physician, is good at what they does. I feel confident, when it comes to advise from them.
1	I trust my child's physician because she has been with her since birth and does and amazing job at always explaining the immunization and anything else she will do or we should be concerned about 
-1	I don't like being pushed to have flu shots and also having to take certain medications for 'maintenance' reasons.
1	There is no reason to not be honest about any conditions. I see a physician once a year and take no medications, so there's nothing much to tell.
-1	I feel he listens to my concerns and takes the time to listen to what I have to say and clearly explain my options.
-1	Don't have a primary physician at the time. Don't take the time to really know me and what have led to any problems I am now experiencing.
1	Have had the same doctor for 20+ years. Always has been on the ball. Good with reminders and any updates.
-1	My doctor is very thorough and is not satisfied until he reaches an answer. I definitely trust him with all my health problems.
-1	Doctors know more than the low class so they are going to organize and make references to medical advice based on the economy and budget.
1	My doctor always takes time with me and ask my feelings towards things. They have never misguided me and always seem to have my best interest in mind.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has known me for over twenty years.  He is aware of all my medical issues and takes care to make sure i am getting the best care possible.
1	Past experiences in hospital and evaluations,Help given to family and friends,hospital meeting to discuss treatment and future options
-1	Being in an HMO I feel cost concerns sometimes trump procedures that should be done Doctor sometimes seems rushed and spends too much time on his computer instead of talking to me.
-1	I have only had my PCP for  a short time so we are still in the trust building stage - more to be determined after further diagnosis and treatments.
-1	I hardly ever see a doctor because my health  clinic has mostly nurse practitioners.  I do trust their judgement but they don't have the experience and training that doctor's have.  When I ask to see a specialist it very seldom happens unless I keep asking.  In conclusion I trust my nurse practitioner in general but would like to see a doctor sometimes.
1	I have always trusted my primary care doctor as she listens to me when I talk and always asks me if I understand the treatment/ etc.  She makes sure that I know about all my health issues.
1	My doctor has my best interests at heart.  On more than one occasion, she has gone above and beyond what would be expected.
1	My doctor listens well. He all test needed. Though I think he may have to many patients. At times I feel rushed.
1	My primary care physician has a complete understanding of my medical history and of the available treatment options, including vaccinations
1	I trust my doctor because he is very thorough at each visit. He wanted to do 3 month check ups and I kept on saying months. He finally agreed to 6 months if I agreed to come back soon er if I needed to so I did and it never lasts the 6 months. He was going to admit me to the hospital and he had all the paper work done and they even had a room for me when I got there. He wanted me to go in an ambulance and I said I couldn't afford so I went in a personal vehicle.
-1	I  trust my pcp because i have known him and when others were questioning his treatment methods his methodology proved most correct.
1	My primary care physician is thorough and never overlooks so she has ample time to spend with her patients. 
1	She's never steered me wrong.  She takes as much times with me as she feels is needed, she's extremely thorough and understands my condition well.
1	all doctors are not created equal; some are better than other my own doctor is very trust worthy i completely  trust him
-1	I trust doctors in general because I feel like they have the knowledge and experience to make sure that my health condition improves. 
-1	They want to see patients more quickly to make more money so they aren't careful or thoughtful. Some healthcare professionals are also judgemental if you do or don't do something that's right.
1	I trust him because he points me in the right direction when it comes to medication and to find a specialist. He would tell me the good and the bad when it comes to the medication and the specialist.
-1	I have to go to a clinic for my primary care and the doctors are always changing.I think they are limited in what they can do for me.Some are more helpful than others but I generally trust them.
1	"Since my first visit, post-diagnosis, my Oncologist has taken the time to thoroughly explain all treatment options, along with the associated benefits and side effects.  He advises which treatment course he recommends and then discusses any questions for concerns I may have.  I am now 8 months past what I like to call my ""expiration date"" of 7 - 14 months life expectancy, on my second treatment option and controlling side effects efficiently with minimal use of additional pharmaceuticals, as my wish s to control my cancer with as few chemicals as absolutely necessary and my Oncologist completely supports that as my choice."
1	I like and trust my primary physician. He takes his time with me and answers all my questions. I believe he's well-informed.
1	I've been with my primary care doctor for a number of years, and feel he does have my best interests at heart... he takes enough time with me at every visit, and will answer any question I have. 
1	I trust my primary care physician because she always takes time to listen to my concerns and explain things.  She also doesn't dismiss my feelings and thoroughly checks things out.
1	I love my primary physician.  I do not go that often to the doctor but when i go with my husband he sits down with both of us and explains what is going on and then he explains how he is going to be treating the problem.  I do not think I could ever ask for a better doctor.
1	Doctors are great people who you can trust. I know I trust my physician with my life. Never let me down. 
1	I have went through hip replacement serg and my Drs were very helpful, explaining everything to me. I trusted what they had to say and I followed their advice 
-1	My primary care physician is a great doctor. He seems to genuinely care about my medical situations and does his best to solve them.
1	He is always up front with me and he explains thing's so I can understand what he is talking about. He really seems to care about my health. If he's not sure what is going on he will send me to a specialty doctor to find out what is going on. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she seems like she cares about my well being and wants to help.
-1	Doctors' relationship with big pharma inhibits some from providing the right treatment when providing the most beneficial (for them) treatment is a better career and fnancial move. 
1	Although some doctors give false medical treatment, I think my doctor is very passionate and caring about what he does. 
-1	I trust my Dr. But sometimes they need to take people serious and learn about a disease instead of blowing it off.
-1	I've only seen my PCP twice, and trust takes times to build. I like my Dr. Very much, and believe that I will trust him in time. He has a good bedside manner and appears to genuinely care about me . 
1	My doctor I found to be honest with me, taking precautions so that if something is wrong we can correct it in the easiest way rather then going to the extreme (operation) to correct it. He seems to cares and calls me as soon as the results for a test are available.
-1	I dont trust any dr because they just want to push drugs and treat symptons rather than practice preventative sickness or injury
1	They usually Iistens attentively,  always asks if you have any input or suggestions. Does tests, x-rays and send to others doctors for things outside of their scope of expertise. 
-1	Overall, I trust my doctor because I know they are knowledgeable and have years of training experience. However, I don't feel that my doctor sees me as an individual and will always give the best treatment option
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has my best interest at heart. He makes sure that I receive the information and care that I need to make health decisions.
1	I really trust my care physician because they have the knowledge and experience  to knowhow to take care of you
1	My primary care physician is very good at listening.  She listens to any input tht I have and we make a plan of action.
1	most doctors are in it because of the money and don't the job as serious and mature like they should be
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is very knowledgeable about a lot of conditions. The only thing I'm not thrilled about is she tries to get me to take medicine I don't want, instead of looking at natural options first. I know she was trained that way, but I want to try to heal naturally instead of using medicine.
-1	Sometimes I feel like she is being judgy and isn't being thorough. Other times, she is kind and helpful.
-1	It is true that if he did try to explain all of the different medications to me and what they do, I probably wouldn't understand and the meeting would take too long and cost me more money, but for the same reasons, I can't have complete trust in him because there is so much I do not know.
1	My physician is up-front at all times. She will tell you like it is, answers all questions. After lab work is completed can always expect a call in two or three days with results. She will take the time to explain or answer all questions.
1	She's has put a lot thought and selflessness into her work doesn't give up easily keeps track of different levels kindly sees to the weight loss
-1	The doctor I see most  is a neurologist.  I trust him very much, but not completely.  I have to rely on myself as well.  Ask questions, and keep asking them.
1	I've known my doctor for a long time. He always takes the time with me answering all the questions that I have.  I never feel rushed.
-1	I trust her medical opinions and try to ask questions when I need to.  I have been seeing her for years, so she knows my history well. 
1	I have been in the hospital more than I can ever think of, and every time I go to the hospital, my doctor is the best that I have ever found
1	My doctor is very good.  He kind of reminds me of the 'old fashioned' type who would actually take on your health care.  I know that I still must stay tuned to my body and it's needs it's just nice having someone like Dr. Kang who takes it seriously.
-1	Many doctors follow the western methods of treatment: cut, burn, poison. Still others, are constrained by the medical system they are in.
-1	My most recent pcp never checked me or gave me tests I need to find out my problems. He would make it quick in and out visits.
1	I trust my primary physician because he will let you know if he is unfamiliar with a condition and wii arrange for you to see someone else 
1	having been with my primary care doctor for years, following his directives i have remained healthy.  
-1	I have had bad experiences with medical doctors in the past.  I never assume a doctor knows what they are doing or has my best interest at heart.
-1	My doctor urges me to do treatments that will cost the most and does things to her convenience. But she tells me everything I need to know.
-1	My prenatal care experience did not always fully inform and in some areas misinformed or sometimes gave bad recommendations.  
1	She has been thorough with my care and has earned my trust. Most doctors have not been able to do that. 
-1	doctors and hospitals are greedy and profit-driven and are no longer dedicated towards helping patients
1	My physician is also a family friend. He has proven his trustworthiness by taking extra time when I have a visit to the office. He answers all my questions and concerns.
-1	I believe doctors will sometimes skip over something in a hurry to get to the next patient. I do not have any severe illness, but if I did, I would not take the word about care from my primary I would seek out a 2nd and maybe even a third opinion from a specialist.
1	I HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. HE IS KIND  AND IS ALWAYS OUT FOR MY GOOD BEING  MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ANSWERS ALL MY QUESTIONS AND IS VERY HONEST.
-1	I have a history with the doctor I see every month, and so far he listens to me, authorizes diagnostic tests when I have problems, and discusses results with me when he gets them.
-1	He doesn't know my history even though I've been seeing him for years. I have had the same complaint for 3 years and he has done nothing to find a cause. 
-1	There are no problems with any of the health care people i have, they understand what iI need and supple it.
-1	I believe that doctors try to give the best advice but they are also human and thus are prone or at least able to make mistakes.
1	my docter is very good at what she does. she knows exactly how to treat me. and what I need to do to stay healthy.
1	I trust my physician because I know that they will do what I ask. They are very trustworthy and I know they will do everything they can to help me
1	She is knowledgeable, thorough, and rated a top doctor in our area.  Therefore I trust her to recommend proper treatments, medications, and procedures that I may need.  She is also good at answering  my questions and keeping he records of my past visits.;;
-1	My regular doctor knows what i need and has never been wrong. The hospital doctors on the other hand just send me away with what ever they feel like saying that day and send you home with out treating you.
1	My doctors and dentist are honest and trustworthy.  I have been going to them for a long time and find them to be interested in my health and they have always been receptive to answering my questions and concerns.
-1	The reason I do not have trust in my doctor is because they rush through the appointment becaus ehe more peopla see means more money they make. The quality is poor.
-1	I've been going to the same health care provider for many years. I am very satisfied with my health care. I will most likely be there for the duration
-1	the doctor i last saw is no longer working in the doctor's office I go to so I don't know how I would answer this question.
-1	they do not make money of of me not coming back. they need to know i will come back. they took an oath to help people and do what is right
1	the last dr. i had was nice but she left but i'm supposed to have another woman dr. i think that is a plus for me.the former dr. listened and spent time with me and was on time.
1	So far things my doctor recommends have worked. I don't always take everything prescribed though.  She always answers all my questions 
-1	at times I feel I am not being heard and the appointments are rushed and then other times I feel like I am being referred to other doctors to have tests possibly done, when my prmary care doctor could just order the test
-1	He takes the time to listen and then to explain. He asks me questions to understand me and is most often correct.
1	I have been with  my primacy care physician for 14 years.  He has been with me every step of the way during my cancer surgery and treatments and has shown a great depth of interest in my well being.  He was very understanding and compassionate during that time and extremely helpful as always.
-1	Unfortunately, I live in a town where the doctors don't care about anything but money. I have been misdiagnosed (about having a heart attack)  that could have killed me. I have a hard time trusting doctors after that.
1	She hasn't stirred me wrong as yet, I feel confident in her abilities to what is right for me. I trust my Doctor very much.
-1	I do not generally trust or distrust people, doctors included.  It depends on the individual doctor, the condition/issue, the degree to which that professional is (or is not) already behind schedule, on overload, in a hurry, worried, etc.  They are human, after all.  My doctor is quite thorough; in part I suspect it is her way of assuring she stays on track and covers everything though it sometimes seems to be at a cost to whatever my particular agenda might be during a given visit.  We have worked it out that she does her routine questions and I bring a list of my issues, so both of us has time.  This seems to be effective, though it would be wasted in a rotating medico situation where one did not see the same physician regularly.
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician yet I realize that any final decisions about my health (including treatments, medicines, etc.) are my choice to make.  Doctors are there to help the patients, give them advice, and so forth.  It is up to the patient to also rely on him or herself for health care.
-1	I don't trust most doctors. They just see you for like maybe 5 minutes and then get rid of you with meds.
1	my doctor always takes the time to explain all  my options to me all what happens with each option  he is very patient with me and my questions
-1	My doctor seems to want to help treat patients but applies his personal beliefs too often and wants me to mentally overcome certain aliments or rely on God.
1	When I was recently seriously ill, he figured out what was wrong and gave me several solutions and suggestions. When I follow his orders, I feel great.
1	My pPCPis a good person and I trust her.  She is interested in me personally, I can tell, and takes her time when I am with her.  My gut feeling is always good about her.  I'm glad I found her as my PCP.
1	I trust my doctor because he gets very personal and not just all about the work. He actually makes time to have regular conversations to make you comfortable 
-1	My dr only cares about getting out of your room and on to the next person. I am looking for a new dr. At the moment.
-1	this is part of a doctor's education and the Hippocratic oath, the only problem I have in trust is when insurance circumstances limit what's open or if the doctor doesn't seem to be aware of costs (this has not happened for some time)
1	I have always felt my doctor has been totally open and honest with me.  I have never felt rushed.  I feel like I can tell her anything and will get an truthful answer back.
-1	Cause there's no guarantee in what a physician tells you about your state of health and also rely on yourself to take of a health matter that is important to a cause or effect to see how a health matter is a concern to a individual in certain situations.
-1	My PCP only takes 5 minutes with me, asks me a couple of questions, fills out a prescription slip and quickly leaves the room. I do not feel she is acting in my best interests, and she does not listen to me. I react very badly to most manufactured pharmaceuticals, my doctor knows this and keeps trying to insist I try newer meds. Every single time I switch doctors they want to try this. I flatly refuse as I know how ill they will make me. My attitude is... if it's not broken, don't fix it!  I have met very few doctors that actually take the time to listen and really HEAR what I am saying. All I want is a diagnosis and I will treat myself with natural remedies, if possible.  
1	I trust him because he has the knowledge and I have told him everything about me. I don't think he would give me the wrong information about any treatment he would suggest.
-1	I feel like my visits are just to get me in and out.  The last PCP I had did not ask about my condition on my 2nd visit, and ignored my intense back pain when I told her about it.
-1	they are only after money not my health care needs with out money they wouldn't give me the time of day.
1	I trust my primary care physician because we have been in a dr patient relationship for some time and have gotten to know each other pretty well she listens to me and we don't always agree but come to a workable solution 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because he has be caring for our family for over 30 years. we have had numerous family members goto see him and they all have had great experiences with him.
-1	I trust my doctor because they discuss every aspect of my health with me. They also answer any questions I may have. 
-1	All the times I have visited a doctor or had an exam or even surgery I was always treated with respect, I asked many questions, sometimes the same questions multiple times and I always got the same answer and was not steered wrong. Rarely have I had a disagreement with a doctor .
1	I taught in medical schools and know about their selection and training.  It is a time-tested process.  The quality of practicing physicians is assured by this process.
-1	been dealing with my doctor for along time trust what she says                                                        
-1	He doesn't really listen to my concerns or questions, only wants to blow it off like it is nothing. i have to repeat my self a lot
-1	well, I need trust of doctor due to better criteria about some item or procedures about healt. then I feel good with this
1	I have never had a problem with anything my doctor has recommended or prescribed for me for any conditions.
1	ive had past xperiences with my physician like a family doctor.and my doctor tells me everything that i need to know about my condition.
1	He has always given me good advice and I trust him to help me make medical decisions.  Everything he has told me has worked out for the best.
-1	They are often too busy to give patients the time needed to thoroughly discuss patient options or concerns.
1	I trust my dry. Because I have had to have treatments of plasma 3 times a week for 4 weeks and 4 treatments of MeMO have been made better by listening to him and the treatments he suggested.
1	My GP lives down the street from my parents.  He goes to my church and his children are the same age I am.  He has known me for over 20 years, and is both an exceptional person and physician.
-1	I think a doctor will do the best that they can do for someone or the best that a person will let the doctor do
1	My doctor is a really nice guy, very competent, and is open and honest with me about my treatment and diagnoses
-1	I don't really have a relationship with my Primary Care Physician. I probably would mostly trust. I respect their knowledge.
1	My doctor takes time to listen to me and takes time to explain things to me. He us very caring and very through 
1	I trust my PCP because when it comes to his patients he is very thoural. He does what is best for the patient. He also discuss a plan of care with his patients.
1	He knows me, been a patient for years and never had a bad experience. He is kind, a Christian and I trust everything he says.
-1	Sometimes she will give quick fixes to a problem instead of finding a long-term answer or resolution.
1	she has been taking care of me for 10 years and I trust her completely.  She always listens and helps me with whatever is going on
1	He has been my Doctor, and my friend, for many years.  He was also my Mother and my husbands doctor.  I also knew him when he was a resident at the hospital that I worked at when he came to my floor as a student
-1	He's done well with me.. But as I watch my mom begin Alzheimer's my belief in our doctor is dying. He did a test but she passed. It was picking up a piece of paper off the floor.. hmmmmm I know it might be hard to detect... but Doctors should know more about this problem.  
-1	I am not one to question life I take what it gives me and when life gives me lemons a I take em and make some damn lemonade out of em
1	I trust my physician because he seems very thorough with his exams and questions for me.  He listens to me and seems to have my best interests.
1	They're licensed. They know what will be best for you in terms of the medical field. They studied medicine for years compared to you that probably did not hence, why you are consulting a doctor.
-1	She listens to my needs and trys to get to the root of the problem and orders tes%s if applicable and she if affiliated with the neareat hospital
-1	I do not distrust my primary care physician. I have no reason not to trust her by any means. I trust her completely. 
-1	I trust my doctor because they know what is best for me to be in good health. They are kind and treat me with respect. 
-1	No human is infallible, and too often people in positions of power, such as a doctor, can get a bonus for encouraging certain courses of behavior. I like to do my own, unbiased research instead of blindly following new orders. 
1	Listen to my questions by verbal or notes and they give me eye contact not ignore me and also give me advice of things to try out before the next step and have me at times look up information on line if I don't understand what they are talking about
-1	I don't currently have any health issues so there would be no reason for me to not to trust my doctor.
-1	I live in Racine WI. Our primary hospital was bought out by Wheaton Fransiscan. They refused to pay the best doctors what they are worth, so, hence, those doctors left town. They were replaced by doctors who got bs and cs in college. Many have a very hard to understand accent. ALL act like they are on a stopwatch
-1	I think doctors ca n be trusted in general. I do think they hurry you out more quickly than they should to maintain their schedule...which is wrong. I think doctors rely ro heavily on the patient to know what to ask, instead of asking the pertinent questions themselves
-1	I do not trust anyone off the bat you have to earn that trust is not free in this world it has to be proven
1	I trust doctor she's very trusting and she's knows what my condition going to be and what medication to take and keep up to date with it
-1	This doctor now I have is new; so I don't know very well but my last primary care doctor; who just recently retired, always sat down with me and explained the pros and cons of each action he wanted me to take or not take.
-1	They do not listen to me and I feel that they really do not care to try to understand what I am trying to tell them.  It makes me feel like I am not making sense of what is happening to me. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because she always gives a lot of choices and me which one is best for me
-1	I have been with my doctor for over 13 years.  He has been with me from the worst (near death) to my health as of today.  I do have a complex medical history and he will check on the computer just to see if I was in the ER or Urgent Care and will follow up with me if needed.  I feel that my doctor is going far above his help for me.  And I really agree with that.  It is not always a happy road.  We may argue about some of the treatments, but we always come to an answer to the problem.  To me, that is a very big trust in my doctor.
-1	I  have  never had a  bad  experience  with  my   doctor   I  trust  him   completelyif  you  don't  trust  your  doctor  you  shout  not  go to  him
1	never met a doctor who is as thorough or takes the time with me to male sure i understand everything going on with my condition
1	My doctor ask a lot of question and does a good job in knowing what is wrong with me or if something is going on.  Never in a hurry.  Goes over info with me.
1	This is hard because my doctor of over twenty odd years recently retired. I have only seen my new doctor a couple of times. But she was recommended by my previous doctor, so my trust is heightened. I guess it is safe to say that in general, I trust all doctors to know what they are doing.
-1	Sometimes I feel like certain doctors I have been to, just want to get you out of the room. They don't seem to be paying attention to what I am saying. 
-1	he is totally trained and professional, educated about what he does and he does it well. Seems to care about my problems and researches everything  quite well and very thouroughly. Cares about me as a patient.
-1	Previous experience in which a major medical issue was overlooked for years resulted in me not trusting doctors
-1	I trust the doctor because she seems sincere.  She has a no waste time approach and although I think she is giving me the bum's rush at times, she has never been wrong in her prognosis.
-1	I do not have 100% trust in my doctor because she just sends my blood work in the mail & never explain how I can do better I have to figure it out on my own & when she give me prescriptions she never check my paper work to even see if it has something in it that I will have allergic reaction to it or not.
1	I trust my doctor because he/she allows me to make decisions within my rights, but makes recommendations  that he feels would best suit my body and well being. 
1	Sometimes I don't think he tells me everything I should know. It seems the doctor knows everything about you but is unwilling to tell you what he knows. The seem to hide your charts from you and sometimes never tell you your blood pressure or really how you are doing.
1	My Dr explains the good and the bad.She's doesn't sugar coat anything. I trust her,she's easy to talk to
1	My doctor has always been honest with me and he is very humble. If he doesn't know what's wrong, he will say so and have another doctor come in for a second opinion. 
1	He has never told me nothing false and is straight forward with me and my health is pretty good according to him and he never sad or did anything for me not to trust him
1	My Dr is fairly new to me so i am learning to trust her in all matters.  So far she has been on target
-1	They have put in a lot of work to get where they are in their field. They are going to make sure they are doing their job right.
-1	I have completely trusted my physicians in the past.  We just moved so I am still trying to find a physician I can truly trust.
1	I have an excellent doctor who always takes all the time I need at my appointments and from past experience has been very helpful in any condition I am seeing him to be treated.  Feel very comfortable and trust his decisions in my care.
-1	I trust my doctor as far as he wants the best for me. However, he is limited in what he knows. He does not want to say outright that he does not know what to do but he just doesn't know everything. There is just too much to know that no one man can grasp it all. He will suggest herbal supplements but he is not knowledgable about them. He only knows his drug options. I really only go to him when I think I know what is wrong and he can verify it with blood tests or something.
-1	To me it seems like my doctor is always looking out for the best interest of me and my health. My doctor has been there the past few years and most of my major medical issues and has given me excellent advise that I have followed and improved my overall health.
-1	I trust my doctors but you always need to have common sense when it is about your heath. I just don't take what they say ad not do any research on my own.
1	Doctors are generally better educated and up to what's current in health care.  I have trusted my doctor for many years now.  He was the first one to recognize that I needed surgery.
1	They have proven to be thorough and caring in the way they handle me and my health problems, they have never given me any cause for doubt and have a good open bedside manner.
1	I have gone to him for years and he listens to my concerns and acts on them. He knows if I complain, there is usually something wrong. 
-1	I have been around the medical community for a long time and would trust the training of doctors more than myself or the internet. 
-1	I trust my doctor to always be truthful with me and I always tell him what he needs to know. I've been going to my doctor for years and I trust him
1	While both my wife and I are under care with the VA system, both our doctors spend the time needed to explain what's going on, why something is happening, and the best path to follow, particularly conserning my wife's ongoing condition.
1	I totally trust my physician because he is dependable, intelligent, caring, and just a great man. He is versed in his profession and moreover very easy on the eyes.
-1	I do not have any medical problems. I do not visit hospitals or doctors. I do not have a primary physician.
1	My doctor seems to care about me and my conditions. He does not rush through talking to me and actually listens to what I have to say. 
1	"My internist is always honest with me about any tests or diagnoses he provides.  He tells me options with meds, testing, surgeries, etc, then gives me the choice of how to proceed.  He never ""talks down"" to me, and explains thoroughly. He keeps good track of my health, immunizations, mental health, medications and tests.  He follows up with me after most visits to see how I'm doing."
-1	I trust him because he listens to me and answers questions I have. he is polite and not pushy if I don't want a certain shot
-1	My Doctor is so very busy that she has some helpers that see her patients. They are good at what they do I suppose, and it is easy to see them for an appointment. I do wonder if they know my health as well as my Doctor. 
-1	I knew that my physician was honest and caring when he called me at home to check on how I was doing. He is a straight talker - doesn't sugar coat anything but is still kind in delivery (even with unpleasant news). He never seems in a hurry to be done with an appointment. 
1	We have known him for over 20 years and two wonderful children and he has never been wrong with us. We trust him with our lives and children
-1	I trust my doctor with my medical condition because I hope the know what they are doing and have the knowledge and tools to help me if I have test done or a sickness. If I have doubts or distrust than I will sure to make sure I get a different health provider or doctor
-1	They have experience but very alert of some doctors but mostly they are trustful and put their patients first 
-1	I am neutral in regard to this question, for I at the present time do not possess a primary care physician.
-1	Doctors in general are trustworthy.  They spend a lot of time in school and in practice.  They see lots of different things that happen to people and gain knowledge from those experiences which they can draw on to diagnose ailments.
-1	A primary care physician is something like an immediate or emergency physician. It is to which we go first and these doctors see the seriousness of the health problem
1	I have been going to my doctor for the last 26 years.  He is a fabulous doctor and I trust him in every way!!
-1	I rely on my doctor to select what s/he thinks are the three best treatment options for me based on what s/he knows about me.  However, I expect her/him to review the pros and cons of each option, entertain my question/s and then let me pick the treatment that I think is best for me.  If my medical professional can not help me navigate that process then I do not trust him/her and would look for a new PCP.
-1	Doctors spend minimal time with their patients and don't devote honest care to them. They always seem really busy. 
-1	i trust my doctor - he has never lied to me and always is there when i need him - i can call and get an appointment the day i call
-1	I do not really have a doctor.  I have a physician's assistant.  There is a doctor there, and he is listed on my card.  However, I do not see him.  I see the physician's assistant.   She is very considerate and helpful.  If I have a need for anything, I can email her which is very helpful because it is hard for me to hear on the phone.  She usually gets back to me in a good amount of time.  She answers my questions the best she can.  
-1	At the time I wasn't going to my primary doctor but I was pregnant and I guess I was taking off my mom's insurance so I couldn't make an appointment until they fixed it. Well when I finally got back on it and had an apoointment, instead of checking on the baby we just did a pregnancy test and questionnaires.  Second appointment was once I started losing him. They did a ultrasound and said he was fine. Later that day I had a huge headache and threw up the next day I was fine. That following Thursday he came out too early. When I told them my water broke they didn't try to help me. I had to take a picture in order for moves to be made. The nurse wouldn't tell me a gender. They never asked if I wanted to hold him or bury him. He was still attached to his cord and the placenta was somewhat still inside. For about 4 hours my son sat in between my legs with the placenta still inside of me. Once they finally found that type of doctor she took the placenta out and basically dropped him on the floor. I feel more should've been done that first and second appointment and both trips to the er. Then the following month they thought I had a std. Everything came back negative but no further tests on me as to why i had all the symptoms and why my son came out so early.  I had about 4 (I forgot what it's called but you get it often when you're in your 30s) last summer. Soon in August or September I had a follow up and he was a boy and there wasn't anything wrong with him. I knew that when we saw him on the ultrasound. He was alive and active. 
1	I have been with him a long time and totally trust him with my care, medical advice, treatments and recommendations.
1	"Because my primary doctor sent me to a specialist, I have a second opinion that concurs with her conclusions and course of treatment so I trust my doctor.  When she isn't sure, she sends me to a specialist--she doesn't guess or ""wing it"".  She has lab tests performed routinely and bases decisions upon data."
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been my doctor for many years and I'm still alive. I trust none doctor to take care of me n cause he's educated and experienced. 
1	I finally found a doctor that doesn't only wants to prescribe more medicine.  He agreed with me that some to the prescriptions I was taking I did not need.  He  and I agree that there is only one that I do need.  Finally a doctor that is not a pill pusher.  
1	ive been with her and my other specialists for a long time theyve been and  seen me through several serious ailments
1	I don't know; they're honest and trustworthy and I find them believeable. I don't know what else I can say.
-1	I generally just my primary care physician, because I've had good experiences with her for the most part, but she did let me down in a big way recently and that's shaken my trust in her. I'm also having problems with another person I see, and it's making me trust medical professionals less because she's so bad.
1	i trust my doctor because he is a good hearted person very honest person my doctor is always nice and patient with me
1	I have a long relationship with my family doctor.  He is an internist in family medicine.  He looks for possible problems developing down the road and speaks freely with me.  He orders routine bloodwork and always follows up on any irregularities.  He will call on a Sunday afternoon and say I was just reviewing your chart and I think we should do.....He is board certified and makes me feel confident in his decisions.  I always do whatever further testing he asks me to do whether it be additional bloodwork, mri's, cat scans. etc.
-1	He know what wrong I dont so he nice and kind answer all of my question I! Very happy with my doctor I trust him
-1	I mostly trust my doctor because I know he is honest and he has not steered me wrong yet and I've gotten better from illnesses and he seems to care 
-1	I don't trust a doctor who rushes on everything he do he or she ask what's wrong then not even looking at the problem just say you need to lose weight that don't make sense to me
1	I think they are not qualified enough to work in the health sector, so sometimes I look for a second opinion
1	I trust my doctor because she is very reassuring and very willing to talk to me and explain any thing I don't understand 
-1	My doctor has my best interest in mind. She is very thorough and always checks to make sure everything is ok with me. She also understands my state of mind and experiences so she is very healthy to deal with 
-1	I trust my doctor because they explain any thing to me .if I need further info they will obtain it for me 
-1	for the most part he takes the time to listen to what I have to say and explain why he wants me to take a medication or have a test done. However he doesn't make any changes when I suggest that some medication can be stopped or reduced
-1	Sometimes to dis day then back from twenty years they hardly do a phiscal check. No a days there always just listen what you say and on a computer..
-1	He has proven himself trustworthy and very intelligent. As a Christian he offers his services in ministry and offers a lot fee when patients don't have insurance.
1	I trust my physician because he tells me stories on how he basically knows his stuff and content and it just sounded so convincing that it made me believe he's smart
-1	My doctor know more than me, he is the expert so I trust him completly over what I googled or found on med md, he went to school for this.
1	Because of the way the Doctor thoroughly explains to me so I can understand what he is saying and he takes his time with me and answers all my questions and concerns
-1	I am not sure how thorough my doctor is, but I feel confident that she will answer direct questions appropriately
1	I have had skin cancer and my PCP referred me to a specialist which resulted in the removal of a skin cancer.  He always asks if there is anything different in my physical condition that might cause problems, and is never in a big hurry to end my appointments.
-1	Doctors in general tend to over prescribe medications and are not explaining any of the side effects that they might cause.
-1	I trust my doctor with most things some things I research on my own especially if it is about taking a new medicine
1	I can't think of a time when I didn't trust a physician. I have had good experiences with the different doctors I have used for different medical situations throughout my life.
1	I know him as a doctor for many years and how he feels about my condition. Usually he is correct with a diansis and treatment.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he has never done me wrong . He's delivered both of my babies . I have never had a bad experience with him . He's a loving,  caring man and I couldnt ask for a better doctor . I recommend him Dr Joseph's from spotsylvania regional. 
-1	I trust my primary care provider to handle basic health issues that may arise. I also trust that she will put me in touch with a specialist if needdd.
1	I have gone to my doctor for many years. He has been in practice for a long  time and is very open and honest when he speaks with me. He tells me the things I really need to hear. I trust his judgement in regards to my health.
-1	My primary care doctor has been my doctor for 20 years and has seen me and my husband and my children and I trust him completely.
-1	I have had the same PCP for over 20 years and he has been straight and honest with me over the years..
1	Usually he will tell me what i need to do to take precautions on anything and try to help when i am in a bind with medicine if at all possible.
1	You ask him a question and he answers with plain English.  If he doesn't know something he will tell you and look it up.
1	she is very professional and understands my needs, especially when it comes to both my physical and mental health issues
-1	i have never had a reason to distrust them. They have never lead me in the wrong direction and they are always available to answer any questions that i have.
-1	Haven't been to the doctor in a while. I'm not sure if I have ever met my new doctor. I don't get sick often
-1	I trust drs because as a general rule I think they will do what is best for you. If for no other reason so they can keep your business.
1	I formerly disliked, feared, and distrusted doctors. I have recently found a new primary care physician in whom I have complete trust and great respect for. Doctor Hekman at Cleveland Clinic has completely changed my feelings about doctors. He is knowledgeable and compassionate especially regarding my being a transgender woman.
-1	INDEED I TRUST MY PHYSICIAN IT PROVIDES ME A GREAT ADVISE IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE MORE 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH HIM WITH NO PROBLEMS NOT RESOLVED
-1	I get a long well with all of my Dr's, If I do not trust them I will get another Dr.I also listen to other peoples opinions on what they think of the Dr's
1	I trust my doctor for two reasons: 1) I have close family members who have been patients of his for many years all of whom highly respect and trust him, and 2) I have been his patient since moving to this town four years ago, and have never had reason to doubt or question his diagnosis, or opinions. when he makes a decision, he ALWAYS asks MY opinion of it, and if I have any questions about it. He is always willing to spend the time to listen and explain everything to my satisfaction.
-1	Sometimes she doesn't always get things right, but most of the time she does.I trust in her ability to find the best solution. 
-1	I use the v.a hospital for my Drs. I just moved from Michigan to Tennessee & the Dr here is not staying on her job very well
-1	I think he listens to me and I trust him very much. He is thoughtful and takes the time needed to discuss conditions with me. He is a respected doctor and takes the time to answer all of my questions
-1	I dont have one. Cause I dont want one. I take care of me. No medicnes here EVER.I know what it is the best for me. A doctor dont.
-1	The doctors ive seen lately come in the room like a tornado .they are always in a huge hurry theres no way they can properly diagnose patients 
-1	My PCP has demonstrated competence and a comprehensive knowledge about any issues I take to him.  He's great!
1	I trust him because over the years we have built a relationship the is both honest and respectful.  At no time have I had reason to doubt his expertise
-1	I trust hee because she is a specialist but i have done everything she asked me to regarding changes my diet and takon medications and gettung tests done but she never calls to check how im feeling or gets to results
-1	I give them the benefit of doubt.  They are schooled doctors and took this profession to help people. Why would I not trust?
1	Have had the same doctor for years and is always patient and never rushes. Has called the house even to check after a hospital release and called my husband to make sure we were settled
-1	I just do because they talk and ask me questions so they are really educated on that kind of stuff that makes me feel reassured
1	My doctor always takes his time with me. He talks about everything I need to talk about and do not need to talk about.
-1	Doctor's are too tied to pharmaceutical companies so that has to be taken into account and I prefer to avoid meds whenever possible.
-1	The doctors are just for a paycheck and they really dont care about their patients.  It is sad that they dont have a caring heart.  I rather go to a doctor who really cares and not looking at you as money in their pocket
-1	She is helping me with my condition and she has more knowledge in that area than i do, so i trust her that she is doing the right thing.
-1	"Trust is a two way street.  The doctors do not trust you when you are in pain.  Because they do not trust you when you are in pain, the doctors decide that it is a good thing to poke and prod you until you actually scream.  After they hear you scream, they then decide that ""oh, maybe you are in pain"". That is when you will be given a hand full of papers otherwise known as referrals, to go to a place where they do x-rays.  After signing in with them, you have to fill out all of the paperwork once again.  It is a tedious job to continue to fill out the same forms over and over again.  The referral doctor takes the x-rays, and tells you to make an appointment with your original (primary) doctor.  The doctor that tells you to make the appointment with the primary doctor will then read your x-rays and send the results to your primary doctor. It seems to me that the primary (original) doctor is just sending you back and forth to different doctors to get additional payments from the insurance company.  I just do not trust any doctor.......they are all out for themselves."
1	My primary care Dr. always takes time to LISTEN to me, and explains any medical issues to me in  terms that I understand.
-1	The last time at the physician's office my doctor gave me the same medicine that I was given at the hospital.  I went in for knee pain and unable to walk. I had the results sent to my doctor's office, but she didn't even remember looking at them. She didn't send me to get x-rays, MRI, or anything else.  Still having knee pain and very hard to walk.
1	She actually cares, she listens to resolve instead of listening to respond. She allows me to speak and fully explain myself without cutting me off like most doctors. 
-1	I really love my primary care physician. She is careful and thoughtful, but she is only human. I know she will do her best by me, but that doesn't mean she is always right.
-1	I have never had a doctor that I trust 100% because they are human beings and they see a lot of clients in one day and have made plenty of mistakes. It is up to me to stay vigilant and decide on how to proceed based on my doctors suggestions.
-1	I like my primary care physician, but I don't really trust the technology that is used.  I don't trust that information entered into computers is always correct and not entered into someone else's account.  I would not trust everything that is done or said if it didn't seem to make sense.
-1	My care physician is the closest I can get to without having to drive almost 100 miles round trip. The clinic that my doctor is based at is always over crowded and busy so I rarely get much time with my doctor. She tries to do what she can for me but she has admitted that it has not been easy since more and more paper work has been added to her daily work and she was forced to take on more patients than she can handle. My doctor is wore out most of the time and often times I have to mention things like possible blood work that should be done or scans because she won't always think of them. She has too much on her plate and it is hurting her patients overall.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been with him for a very long time with no issues ever my routine checkups go well with everything explained to me 
-1	I trust my doctor but I feel like I'm certain situations like if I had cancer or something serious, I would look into my options.
1	I trust my doctor because he is a professional.  I am also in good health so I know that I am not at risk.
-1	I had a hard time answering because I have not been to a PCP for 8 years or so because I have not been at all sick.
-1	"I trust my primary care physician because I believe that (while it is a generalization), doctors are overall very dependable. However, I also feel as though many physicians will tell patients they ""need"" certain testing, only for their own financial gain."
-1	Not all doctors let patients know all of their options as far as treatments are concerned. I try to trust my doctors because I have to. They are the ones with the MDs in ultimately should know best. I do use my own judgment at the end of the day but put trust in my doctors and what they tell me.
-1	Depending on what type of insurance you have, some doctors may give you the cheapest treatment instead of what's best.
1	He is thorough and answers questions also personally calls  with test results Will take time to explain tests ordered and why. Always feel he has time to listen appointments are never rushed
-1	i don't trust anyone especality doctors i mean what is the worst that can happen if one of their patients dies i mean after all the have malpractice insurance and the law on their side.
1	I trust him because he always been right in diagnosis my problems if any & able to provide the correct medicine & counseling.
1	I trust my doctor because I would think he knows what he is doing, at least I hope he knows what he is doing. I've only had one doctor in the past that I don't think he knew what he was doing and I found another doctor.
-1	I have seen my doctor for a long time. We have a good rapport, they're honest and clear me. In aldi very much trust my son's pediatrician, he's good at what he does. Quick to the point. 
-1	feel rushed at the doctors office so i tend to gloss over a lot of problems and hope they just go away
1	She listens to me and we have an excellent report. I think she is  caring and remembers me from previous appointments.
-1	I trust my primary care physician although it sometimes hard to understand her. She is not from America. She is Indian.
-1	Most doctors get paid commission on certain products. This is conflict of interest. I don't trust that
-1	They make matters worst. They don't want patients to get well.  Money is only on their mind.  They don't fully try to understand the patients' needs.
-1	A primary care physician (PCP), or primary care provider, is a health care professional who practices general medicine. PCPs are our first stop for medical care. Most PCPs are doctors, but nurse practitioners and even physician assistants can sometimes also be PCPs.
-1	Doctors in the past seemed to care more, and spent more time with you, now everything has a prescription, and they don't tell you about something that will work without prescription.  And it seems as if they're not really listening anymore.
-1	i trust my doctor fully...if i didn't i would switch doctors as soon as possible.... i have had my doctor for most of my life
1	We discuss what I should be doing at my age in regards to health screenings and such be he always leaves it up to Me he gives the pros and cons , but he has no agenda other than to inform me which I like
-1	Because she does not listen to what i have to tell her . she tells me i should go see more doctors like im made of money.
-1	Because theybcan totally lie to you but yeah uavent you heard of doctors lying their patients like dude that's why slwmtimes you can't just trust undone like make sure you asked of their degree and look up there history 
-1	i have know my doctor for many years, trust all his recommendations and scripts.i have referred friends and family to see  also.
1	I trust my doctor by telling them if something is wrong or if a medication isn't working. They are very helpful if i have a question for them
-1	I just recently started to see my doctor. He seems to have a good bedside manner. He spends time with me and listens and is trying to help me resolve my issue 
1	Because she looks out for my well being if i have a problem she will recommend treatment or send to a specialist.
1	I feel that they know what they are doing and really listen to my input and take that into consideration.
-1	I have seen a few different doctors over the past 10 years who have not taken me seriously and blew me off â that is when I came in with a list of things I wanted to have checked out, that had been bothering me over the several years that I had not been to a doctor, the doctor barely looked at the list and then told me I was normal and healthy without even checking the things and by the time I left the office I realized I haven't totally blown off. He didn't care.
1	My PCP seems to be a thoughtful woman and is very good at listening to me and my concerns.  She is not assertive so might seem hesitant but I feel that is just her way.
-1	It isn't that I distrust him, but I rarely go to the doctor so I don't have many interactions to reference. 
-1	Because I hate people and no one truly cares about u unless they love you. People become doctors mostly for the paycheck 
-1	I feel like drs in general go the easy route. Also, I feel they prescribe more medicine than is necessary and it causes harm, and I don't like that feeling. 
-1	In the past I have been misdiagnosed three times finally I found a nice doctor who tested me for Lyme disease and it came back positive being misdiagnosed made it worse and very hard to eliminate.
-1	I trust my doctor because he's been my doctor for many many years and knows me.  My only concern is that he sometimes deems my problems less serious than I do.
-1	He took me off a dangerous medication without out weening me off without caring about side effects of quitting cold turkey I.lost weight I can't sleep my anxiety spiked up I'm.jittery
1	my doctor always seems to know how to treat me well I wouldn't go to anyone else unless referred to by my regular doctor
1	My doctor seems to have a genuine interest in my well being. I am open and honest with him which I feel is rare in patient-doctor relationships. I don't see any reason for him to be dishonest with me. He takes time to know my needs and problems so he can effectively treat them.
-1	Im in the middle.  I trust him because he is a physician and he tries to make my health better.  In a way i dont trust him because he doesnt give me more alternatives to make my health better
-1	I often trust what doctors are telling me because most of the time, they are right. I believe that most doctors in America are well trained in medicine, so I would expect them to be very helpful and/or professional.
-1	I have a long term history with the medical practice and have had good experiences.  I have trained with several of the medical professionals and have trust in them.
-1	Usually my doctor has been spot on with any diagnosis and knows her stuff. Just wish she was a little  more  personable  and not rushed.
-1	I trust my primary care phycician. Since coming into her care she has always been helpful as kind. I believe she helps me to the extent of her abilities. 
-1	I think there are high quality people in the healthcare professional and some that are not of average or less as providers. I judge by my interactions with each individual.
-1	I do not think that doctors much care any more. I think they are short on time and just need to earn the dough. 
-1	At the moment I do not have a doctor.  The one I went to for many years retired a few years ago.  I have not needed one since that time.
1	I have been with my doctor for many years; we trust each other and work well together, also have mutual respect
-1	I trust my doctor, but I feel her decisions regarding my care are tied up because my insurance is Medicaid, and a lot of options are not open because they wont pay for it
1	I trust my doctor because she seems up to date on everything new and lets me know the best options fo rme without breaking our budget
-1	I have been going to my primary care care phycisian for many years. He has helped my husband and I through several problems. I had one problem that he could not solve and he kept sending me to different specialists. After 3 years finally found the one in Dallas that immediately knew what my problem was. After open heart surgery he found a problem my husband had that the heart surgeon and heart doctor had missed. So yes I completely trust my family doctor. 
1	My doctor is an exception to the rule; she is interested in what I have to say and the questions I ask and is in no hurry to rush me out.  She leaves when I signal that I am satisfied with my visit.
1	what with all the writing questions enough ok, my doctor is the best and has been for a long time but is retiring and that is a bumer
1	I trust my doctor because he always gives me options on treatments. he tells me the pros and cons of each type of treatment offered. He lets me choose what I feel is right for me.
1	My doctor has demonstrated thoroughness for many years, and stays on top of my needs and/or issues. 
1	I trust my provider because they are very good at explaining all the options available to me. She takes time to listen to my concerns, even if it isn't very serious.
1	I have had my oncologist for the last 5-6 years and I trust his opinion and I trust his treatment for me I have cancer my life is in his hands so I trust them
-1	my reasoning to why i trust my primary care physician is because she makes feel like i can be open with my doctor. 
-1	My doctor has never done anything to not have my trust. He goes out of his way to make me feel comfortable and is willing to go out of his way for me and my family. To the point of calling me after hours when my oldest was sick and not getting better.
1	Because he never really can tell me what is wrong with me. And I can't understand him clearly which bothers me. And he always blows me off
-1	In all honesty, I do not trust my doctor at all. It seems as if most doctors in general mostly just care about their own convenience and making money. Even though the job itself is to help people, to them it's still just a job to them at the end of the day. 
1	been seeing my dr since 2015 after my own regular dr of 10 yrs messed up my ekg and heart condition.. my new dr found out i had high cholesterol and my old dr prescribed me pills for high blood presssure when i didnt have high bp . now i trust my new dr she never steered me wrong 
-1	i trust my pcp because i have not had a reason not to when it comes important things in my life that could meen life; or death.i do get nervous when it comes to something major though.
1	I have been seeing the same physicians for over 30 years. I have complete trust in them and am comfortable that they treat my family as well. I would be very disappointed if I had to find another physican(s).
1	I'm lucky that I have not had to go to see my doctor often. I see a nurse practitioner and feel that see is totally competent and I trust her to give me the right diagnosis.   
1	 I've been going to my doctor for about 10 years and I feel she knows me well. She has been very caring when I had upsetting personal experiences in my life. I definitely feel she listens to what I have to say.
1	I have complete trust in my doctor because of how he has treated me in the past with being ill also I've known the doctor for years 
-1	I feel like they are doing the best they can, but are overworked and quality care is diminished, that does not mean that I distrust my doctor by any means, I just know mistakes can be made because they're only human.
-1	good experience in the past and a relationship of several years; i trust they are educated and continue to update their knowledge
-1	Doctors are highly trained and know what they are doing. They would never intentionally do something to harm me. They want to make me better
-1	I do not know my current PCP well.  She is the 3rd PCP I have had in as many years. One doctor retired and the next one moved to an employee health position.Once I get to know a doctor and they get to know me we can work together equally to give me a positive outcome.  I have been on Medicare less than a year.  There are many changes in what a physician is allowed to prescribe for different parameters.  Each stage of life has it's own learning curb.
1	My doctor has a great reputation with his patients.  He's been a great doctor and has treatment effectively when other doctors have not been successful.  He makes sure I understand everything before leaving his office.
-1	Physicians, doctors, pharmaceutical industries and pharmacists are not trustworthy. They work together in their individualistic pursyits. The patient is not primary goal, their money being pocketed is. 
-1	I am just a person the Doctor puts my name in the computer.  What happened to the good ole days when the Dr. Looks at me instead of the screen.
-1	I do trust doctors. The only thing I disagree with is if you call with a question they say go to the ER or doctor immediately. that is not always the case.
1	I trust my primary care physician because I feel that she truly cares about my well being.  If a medication is too expensive/not covered by my health insurance, she will suggest a generic alternative that works just the same and saves me money.
1	I have been with him for many years. I have done just about everything suggested and I am in pretty good health
-1	I didn't trust many of my previous Dr's.  I felt they gave me lip service and didn't really retake an interest in me. I now have a new medical person who seems to care.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor at this time, just lost my health insurance and moved to another state, but my previous doctor was ace all the way.
-1	All doctors tend to have their own way of doing thing and thinking about issues. I feel like it is safe to say that they do not know everything and can be wrong just like anyone else.
-1	I don't think most physicians are as up to date as they should be or as willing to look into the issues that they should always
1	Because they are well trained and experienced in their field, and they know more about my health than I don.
1	I have never had any reason not to trust what my Doctor tells me. He has always been very straight with me about everything.
-1	To rushed with dealing with too many other clients every day of their lives also tyhey do not really carte since they all drive BMW;s every day..
-1	The only reason I go to my doctor for a yearly wellness check up is because I have to in order to have my prescription birth control refilled. I don't particularly like my doctor and sometimes I feel like she doesn't know what she's talking about.
1	I relay on the physician to make care of the situation that the doctor can determine to right medical knowledge best suited for me.
1	My doctor is amazing. He has several degrees and is one of a handful of Holistic doctors in Minnesota. He is beyond smart, compassionate and honest. I've seen many doctors over the years, but this doctor is my favorite and only one I will ever see again.
-1	my doctor has given me no reasons to doubt his thoroughness and ability to treat me.  I trust he gives me good advice and wants me to be as healthy as possible
-1	Doctors in general. Are great for the world.  89 percent of dr.s are good at wat they. Afew dr.s make mistakes as any other human.  Dr.s should continue to evalate their patients and keep saving lives. And also 
-1	I know he does what is good for me hes been in practice for years sometimes he does things weird but in the end he is right
-1	I have concerns about certain issues my doctor seems to just not care about or tell me its normal when i know its not normal for me, i dont like the word normal when it comes to health care because nobody is the same.
-1	If my doctor would try a little harder and ask the questions this survey has,  he might understand me more.  Instead he will ask two questions prescribe a pill and send me on my way.  
-1	I don't have a regular doctor anymore due to no insurance and the clinic we were seeing closed. Most doctors I've experienced blame any and all of my health issues on my being overweight. Unfortunately, this has left many conditions undiagnosed for years, some of which actually contributed to my overweightness.
-1	I trust my doctor because he is truthful, he is always right in the diagnosis because he does all the necessary checks and he is also the family doctor
-1	My primary physician has a good bedside manor and takes time to listen and explain things.  She does not rush me.  She seems to have a good understanding of my health concerns.
-1	I have never had a reason not to trust anything my doctor has told me.She's always very thorough and honest
-1	I generally trust my primary care physician but I also like to back up her information with what I can learn from trusted medical websites. I have only been with this primary for a year so I think we are still learning to trust each other. It can take some time to become really comfortable with each other.
-1	Sometimes my doctor doesn't remember my conditions and even though my chart is in front of him automated.  I have to remind him of my medical issues.
1	She's never disappointed me. Every time I go to her, she's right about what's wrong. And the long term treatments help also. 
-1	My doctor has achieved a medical doctrine, that took years to get. I have to trust him to a certain point. Honesty if I have doubts then that's when I patronize a different medical establishment. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician because we have worked together for a while and she knows what I need and she is always willing to help in any way she can
-1	I do not have a pcp, although  it rust that doctors do the best they can; unfortunately they do not know everything.
1	Cause he never told me something that was wrong I have a lot of trust for my doctor until I am proving wrong I have high trust for my doctors 
1	I have now been with my particular Doctor for over 10 years.  He is the best and most concerned Doctor that I have ever had in my life time.  He watched over my health and concerns with loving kindness.  I trust his decisions for my  health Concerns completely.  
-1	i read a lot, so a dr. would really have to explain why i might need more medication or might need a procedure before i decide to go with her advice
1	He's very sympathetic and a good listener.  I have been going to him over 20 years.  He's never steered me wrong
-1	I trust them, but I also like to form my own opinion based on my knowledge and experience. Sometimes doctors are not familiar with your entire history so I think it is up to patients to advocate for their own best interests as much as they can. 
1	I trust my primary physician based upon the relationship that we have developed since I began seeing him.I can trust him.
1	Everything my doctor has done for me has turned out real well so i trust him completely. He explanins things to me so i can understand them and also lets me know what we are going to do in the long run for my treatment.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician and most that I have visited in the past do not listen as well as they should.
1	I don't have. A primary care physician. But previous ones have been very trustworthy and have my best interest in mind
1	Well, I trust the doctors for their knowledge and their experience and that is the most important thing for me
1	I have never had a reason to distrust her. She has always been forward with me about all my illnesses. If one medication doesn't work, she has a lot more that she can tell me about. I always ask about possible side-effects and she always tells me.
-1	I trust my doctor as he has good reputation with patients,and i have found him to be quite honest,and straightforward in my treatments.
-1	I really love this idea, and I think it's really good, and interesting, this also shows a great variety of many things, and I personally think this is super interesting, and really shows a lot of information, and things.
1	Very good eye contact! Explains things carefully and completely, encourages questions. Not afraid to touch me! Takes his time, not in a rush like an assembly line.
-1	I truth my doctors they wont do anything that would hurt me they are there to help me not to do me any harm
-1	I have had my primary care doctor for q little over a year now. I am comfortable talking about him with anything at this point.
1	I have been going to the same primary care physician for many years, probably at least 20.  I have always trusted what he has said about my conditions because they correspond with the test results I have received.
1	I definitely trust my physician in the sense that they are well trained  and belief they are competent
1	I am comfortable with her. She answers my questions in a language I understand. I don't like to take medication, so we discuss how to do things in a natural way.
1	I trust my primary care physician because she is never in a hurry to get to her next patient.  She makes sure you fully understand all of your options 
-1	I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have been dealing with it for years, but I don't believe my primary care physician has helped me control it. They don't always listen to my concerns with taking certain medications.
1	My doctor has been my physician for over 30 years and he has always been very upfront and honest with his medical decisions 
1	I trust my primary care doctor because when I talk to her she gives me her opinion and with my medical back ground I know that she has my best interest at heart. I know she cares and can tell by the way she responds to me
-1	I like his speech with me . It is full of love and cer toward me . He is very special in his way of speaking and learning
1	I trust my doctor because he always asks me if i understand or if i have any questions he is always following up with me and he is really nice
1	Very likeable doctor. Really wants me to be in good health. I am overweight and he wants me to work on that.
-1	I think I would distrust a doctor because they aren't involved in their patients health and they aren't prepared. 
-1	I trust my doctor, as I have seen him for a while and several of my family members (as well as family friends) go to him too. He is knowledgable and friendly, and is also open to hearing your thoughts and feelings about what's best for your health.
-1	I trust doctors because they know what they are talking about and you can rely on them to keep your best interest at heart. 
1	He listens to me and we discuss the findings, treatments, and plan options. He is always been right, but I'm also a good historian of symptoms.
-1	i trust my primary physician because they really help the sick and they how to help every one they see
1	My doctor spends 45 minutes every time I go see him. It is much needed. We talk about my medications and if I am on track 
1	he or she spent the time to do the hours for whatever good/bad reason to get the degree and then try to keep up, which maybe nerar imposssible
-1	I don't have a primary care physician. I haven't even been to the doctor since I was a kid. But I don't see any reason not to trust your doctor. What advantage could he gain by lying?
-1	I generally trust my physician because usually he will explain everything to me before any decisions are made. I think that they are knowledgeable and know what the fix should be. 
-1	I think my doctor cares about what is wrong with me but i feel he is to busy to listen one hundred percent. He is at a clinc for low income people
-1	My past experience has demonstrated my confidence in my Doctor and his recommendations. His history of tests, advice and goals have proven correct.
-1	my promary doctor is very thoghell when notices the blood test he sends me to a specialist for further testing
-1	I don't think doctors are not taught enough about health.  I prefer to trust myself when it comes to my health.  Doctors only like perscriptions for health. 
1	caring and thorough and has really helped my husband and all his medical issues always quick to respond
1	I've been with the same primary physician for 20yrs, I trust her and depend on her. She always has my best interest at heart.
1	She takes times to be thorough ad suggest what I need. Always have confidencein what she does even though sometimes it is not something I want to do.
1	I just found a new PCP, because my old one was grossly overweight and seemed to not treat  patients as individuals; she wasn't always this way; I know she has some personal problems.  She was wrong about some side effects I was having, and wouldn't listen to me.  My new PCP is very thorough, is a good listener, and is helping co-ordinate my care with several specialists, after an unexpected hospitalization.
-1	I have been going to him for a long time.He respects and knows what kind of person I am.He always Nswers my questions listens to me and helps in anyway he can
-1	If I didn't trust my family physician, I would not continue to visit his office.  I have been blessed with very good health (no major illnesses, never had to take prescription medicines at age 76) so it is difficult to judge my family physician as to trust or not. 
1	I have always had a good long term relationship with my PCP. I see him several times a year even when I feel fine. Health checkups, flu shots a vaccinations ...we are always on good terms. If there's a problem, he won't sugar coat it..he'll be direct and honest...I like that.
-1	I think my doctor does not have time for me.  I have to be my own advocate to find out what is wrong.
-1	He is always pushing me to have surgery. when my back hurt he said surgery, I said physical therapy and the therapy fixed it. he now says I need knee replacement now, but when I went to the orthopedic surgeon, he agreed with me and put me in physical therapy and I am much better. 
-1	my primary physician is new to me, so I dont have a built in relationship with her yet.  She's new to medicine, and that makes me think she is up on the newest medical trends but may also lack experience of knowledge.
1	I trust my primary doctor because she takes the time to talk to me and explain things so I can understand
1	Doctors in general, I feel, are usually professional and honest and I would trust them in diagnosing whatever issue I'm having.
-1	When it comes to protecting your physical health, being able to communicate with your doctor openly and without reservation is essential. When you have a primary care physician that you trust, you are more likely to discuss any health concerns that you have, ask questions about your treatment options, and comply with your doctorâs medical recommendations
1	My primary care doctor is always ready to be there when I need to talk to him and if he can't be there a nurse is always available to get back with me. He is available by phone 24/7 and that is a comfort to me. I have been going to him for several years now and also my brother has been going to him too. Makes sure appointments are set up so that I don't miss any. Explains things in a layman's language so that you can understand what is going on with you physically and what you need to do to take care of any health problems that could arise and to keep me healthy. Makes sure that all vaccines are up to date and that I get my flu shot every year. Very happy with him. Also my dermatologist I am very happy with..He is very up-to-date.
1	My doctor is thorough and honest with me, and discuuses every current issue if any, and reviews all issues in the past...so very happy with my care from my primary physician...
-1	I can trust my primary for basic everyday issues like a sinus infection or acne. But she is not a specialist and doesn't habe experience in more unusual issues.
1	My doctor knows my body as much as I do, maybe more. He knows my existing condition, and past history. If we try a cure for something and it dosen t work, then after awhile, we will try something else.
1	He tells it like it is. He's straight forward no matter if it hurts your feeling or not.  He has always been honest to me and my husband 
1	My doctor usually tells me everything that they want me to do and why I need to do this and why it will help me.
-1	My primary care physician is very easy to talk to and have discussions about any particular problem.  He is almost like a family friend.  We can talk about non-medical things, as well.
1	My doctor has always helped me in any medical decisions I may have to make. I trust my doctor and she helps me in anyway she can
-1	I respect the intellect of medical advisory of physicians however I have faith greater than any man. I trust that people are in me path of life for a reason whether it's a doctor teacher etc. Subconsciously only believing in faith as my provider of knowledge.
1	My primary care physician always listens to me.  He always answers any questions I have about any of my health issues.
-1	I ask about medicines I see advertised on TV if they would help. And he will sometimes say lest try it. Are if another doctor orders medicine for me he acts like it was his idea. I haven't found a doctor I truly trust.
-1	He has always been honest with me. He gives the expression that he undetstands and cares about how i feel. 
-1	I do not trust any doctor I have seen because all they do is ignore you and always write a prescription just to get you out of there office so they do not have to listen to anything your saying.
-1	I don't feel that my doctor has the time to spend with me on a one on one basis because of too many patients.  I also feel that when I ask the doctor to give me a certain test because other family members have a certain condition there should be no reason why I shouldn't be tested to catch an early diagnosis. 
-1	I have been with her for years , and always be honest and truthfully with me on very thing . i want to anything or ask anything ,she will take the time to explain everything to me .
-1	Giving me information about my laboratory results in a broad way and explains every detauls whats going on with my condition
-1	"I have a disability and I have found that some doctors will try and say that it may be related to something else, and try to prescribe courses of treatment that are inappropriate and do not work. So some doctors will behave in such an unprofessional fashion, just so they can be credited with ""curing"" a patient."
-1	I feel that doctors have a person's best interest at heart. I sense see that in the emergency room,  people seem to have the same diagnosis. 
-1	I trust my doctor enough, but I still can't fully trust everythig they say wehn it comes tp payment information and everything else I need to know. The overall feeling of not knowing everything is what keeps me from completely trusting them.
-1	I do not currently have a primary care physician, however, I trust most doctors to be caring and competent while I am proactive in my own care and research treatment options and ask questions of my physician.
-1	My primary care Dr seems to think I'm capable of more physical activity than I really am. My orthopedic surgeon knows exactly what I can do and is proud of my accomplishments.
-1	He listens to my questions and concerns and then tells me what he feels concerning them.  I feel he gives me his undivided attention.
1	I feel like they have my best interest at heart. I can trust that they know what they are talking about and are educated in their field so I don't have to worry about my health.
1	I have been with her for years and have never know her to put me off or not listen. She listens to what I have to say and goes with me. Her medications are spot on and she has checked my record before we have an appointment so we do have to play 20 questions.
-1	Doctors in general have to work to gain my trust-I have had very bad experiences in the past with doctors, so I would say that I am wary anytime I see a doctor.
1	I trust my doctor completely.  We have a long history of him helping me when I was seriously ill.  He has literally saved my life several times.
1	I trust my doctor because he has always been honest.  He has never mislead at any doctor's appointment.
-1	Right now, I have a very good doctor. She takes the time to explain everything. I never feel rushed and in the way. She make me fill like she cares.
-1	I generally trust doctors. They're educated, but I also know they're human and can have biases that may sway the education or logic.
1	"She is ""new"" since my doctor left  and I had to find another.  She is earnest, thorough and explains what is need to know,"
-1	My primary health care told me not to read the inserts that come in your medicine telling you about side effects, they were for lawyers only
1	I have been with the same doctor since I was a teenager and I completely trust him. I never   feel uncomfortable around him because, i know that, i can trust him.   I love my doctor and we share a very friendly relationship with each other at all times.
-1	My doctor has never given me advice or medical care or information that turned out to be wrong or incorrect
-1	I do not trust my primary care physician, but I do trust my specialist.  My PCP seems to be in a hurry and the practice is inflexible, and pushing tests/vaccinations I'm not interested in.  
-1	I trust my doctor but I always do my own research about my health and medications. I have no problems asking if something is right for me.
-1	I trust my doctor's assesments completely although I often feel he knows more than he is willing to share with me
1	I trust my doctor. She always tries to do what is best for me and addresses any of my concerns. She also listens to me and let's me explain any symptoms I've been having.
1	I trust my doctor because he always listens when I express concerns. He takes what I say into consideration and does not dismiss me rudely. He treats me as if he cares about me as a person not just a patient.
1	I believe that the Veterans Hospital has the best Doctors and Nurses and they have been treating me very well for over 30 years
1	Have had same dr for 8 years and has always looked out for my best interest and has made sure the I get the medications that I need
1	My provider is thorough, is patient, has a good way of explaining things. She has a solid education and training and has not been wrong in diagnosing my health problems. 
1	my doctor is honest with me. She gives me the advise I need. If I have a problem, I can rely on my doctor to give me the answers I need and require, I have a lot of failh in my doctor.
1	I trust my physician because she genuinely cares about what is best for me and she always advises me to take extra precautions just in case because you can never be too careful.
1	I trust all doctors to a point, and that point is there is a LOT of new information out there, new discoveries, theories and medicines. The average primary care physician cannot possibly learn it all.    When I had diverticulosus, the surgeon was going to remove part of my colon, and told me I may or not need a colonoscopy bag. I daughter and another friend looked up liposcopic surgery, and suggested that to drain the shit that was filling my abdomen. The surgeon agreed to try. It was successful. When he finished, the surgeon declared that if he ever had diverticulosus, he would want this procedure. I think we can trust our doctors, but we need to educate ourselves to make life better for all of us.
-1	I trust my primary care physician moderately. I have so many health issues on going it is hard for her to keep up with what is going on. I went to have knee replacement surgery in February. Ended up having my ankle fused instead. Apparently I was walking on a broken foot and ankle for over a year. It was aggravating my knee issues. 
-1	I am a retired RN so I know a lot about medicine, I know the kind of questions I need to ask to understand my condition and I realize the physician works for me and I'm not intimidated.
-1	I feel like I am going through an express line in the food line. I go in he asks me a few questions, write a prescription and that is it. They do not get to know you personally.
-1	My doctor and my health care plan have a very good reputation. Therefore, I am trusting them for my Healthcare needs.
-1	I have certain problems diagnosed and my Doctor has me come back multiple times to try new medicines instead of listening to what works for me. 
-1	My Doctor is very thorough and I trust his recommendations for treatments or prescriptions. However, I always do my own research and have refused drugs based on public evidence of problems.
-1	I think sometimes doctors get more money-minded than how they care for their patients. They have a tendency to sugarcoat whats wrong with a patient. I prefer that they are open and honest with me when it comes to mine and my familys health.
1	I have known and used the same primary care physician for over 30 years. I have high confidence in my Dr. based upon many years of interaction.
-1	My doctor seems interested in moving people from the in door to the out door in record time.  He rarely gives more than ten minutes of time to his patients.  
1	My doctor spends the time with me to not only get to know me but II know what my concerns are and delves into things that could be harmful to me and make sure that don't have things negative to my health that can't be seen on the surface
-1	I usually feel that doctors are in a rush and not always taking the time to get all the information to make a diagnosis or recommend treatment 
-1	He is relaxed, personable and most importantly, approachable.  These attributes make him trustworthy and reliable.
1	"My PCP goes to great lengths to ask me in-depth questions whenever I go for my checkups; I'm rarely ill.  It's obvious that she's reviewed my history before I'm ushered into her office; she inquires about occurrences in my personal life as well as about my medical issues.  Most importantly, she actually listens to me and respects my opinions and wishes where medical options are concerned; she won't attempt to persuade me if I say I don't want to risk a med because of its potential side effects - she takes me seriously, unlike some doctors I've had in the past.  She's not got a ""cookie cutter"" all-knowing attitude."
1	My primary physician and I are a team. He knows me well enough to suggest various options for health care with me first before just ordering test or medications. I normally tell him what is wrong and how I think I should be treated and he will either agree or recommend a different course. I trust his opinions and feel very confident in discussing issue with him if I have concerns about what he says to me.
-1	I went through 3 PCP's before deciding to stick with my current choice. This one said the right things on my first visit and instilled confidence in his approach from the get go a marked contrast from the previous two.
-1	She tends to go above and beyond when it comes to finding treatment options that specifically help me both financially and mentally.
1	My doctor always seems very concerned whenever I come in with a serious problem.  He listens to me & tells me what I need to know & do & is always very cordial & understanding.  
-1	My Dr is a great lady. She is baptized, filled with the Holy Ghost and really cares. on top of that she is beautiful inside and out. For the first time in a long time I am actually starting to fill better even though I have copd, Praise God
1	I trust my physician to do what he and I both think are correct in keeping me healthy and protecting my medical records
1	I feel like he has been honest and forthcoming with me.  I went in with questions and I expected him to have answers, because when I chose him, we had a similar outlook about the prescription drug epidemic in America.  That being said, I asked about different vitamins and supplements, since I'd heard a lot of them are unnecessary.  Not only did he tell me which ones I need, but the amounts, which was hugely helpful
-1	My Doctor is very caring despite the short time I have with her during check-ups and I trust her judgement. She always answers my questions and does her best to give suggestions. I trust her judgement but I also do my own research on what is best for my condition so I can be sure that it is the right decision. 
1	I have been going to my doctor for years and have not had any problems. She tells me exactly what I need to do and why
1	I feel totally confident with my doctor since it tells me clearly that it is what I have explains to me how the disease is and how it will cure me according to the treatment given to me
-1	My husband has a situation going on right now when it could be a bacteria (using a certain medication) or it could be an autoimmune issue.  It is all new to us and it seems that the doctor's sense of urgency is just not there .. probably because he has seen it all before where we would like more info, more tests ... more or different meds.
1	My primary care physician has been a faithful friend and advocate for me. She spends time finding out about my illness and she spends lots of time with me.
1	I've been with my doctor for a long and he understand my illnesses and treats with the utmost care. He always makes my health and wellbeing first priority. 
1	I   guess   all   I  can   say   is   that   the   guy   working   on   you  went    to  school   a  long  time   before  he   got   where   he   is   today   so   I  want   to   trust  him   or   her   completely , my   life   is   in   his   hands  on  Earth  but   ultimately ,  we   are   all   in   GODS   hands  and  when   HE   calls   us ,  its  time
-1	I trust my doctor because she seems to care about me - and listen to me when I talk. I have never had a problem talking to my doctor.
-1	I trust them because they went through years of intense schooling to get where they are. That means they know more than me seeing as they are the expert. However I will still do my own research
1	I have been going to my doctor for years & he is honest & straight forward about telling me what is wrong.
-1	I have not been with my primary care physician very long. I was with my last doctor for 22 years and trusted her extremely. She was very thorough and took great care of me. My current doctor is not as thorough and does not prescribe medications, just ginger tea for everything and his blend of vitamins. So I'm not sure how I feel about him just yet.
-1	I trust doctors to a certain extent. although sometimes I feel as if I need a second opinion depending on the situation. 
1	I would not be using the doctor if I did not have complete trust.  I have been with this doctor for 15+ years and she knows my history very well.  She has always explained things really well, especially when something out of the ordinary occurred,  When there was a problem, she found it quickly and was quick to act and resolve the problem.
1	I was diagnosed with breast cancer 17 years ago.  I followed my doctors suggestions regarding treatment & medication and am cancer free and have been for quite a while.  The doctor discussed and explained every in great detail
1	My PCP is a doctor for the right reasons. He cares. He has never tried to rush me out or not believe me in describing issues I had.
-1	when visiting with him he spends a great deal of time explaining and going over all my questions and advises me of all the wrong things I do and tries to have me correct them
-1	I trust him because he is a good person and he has never been wrong in the past. About none of my medical history he is the best.
-1	Because they are in the business of making money and the more sick I am and dependent upon the medication they are giving me, the better for them. I do not believe they truly want me to get well.
1	My doctor understans and is careing about you i trust him to the fullestmy doctor care he stays the same make me want to go back
-1	As a patient, you have probably had the experience of meeting a physician for the first time and very quickly becoming comfortable that he or she has your very best interests utmost in mind. The sense comes quickly; you become comfortable, less anxious. Unfortunately you may have had the opposite experience of encountering 
-1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I am in reasonably good health with very little by way of health issues.  The last time I needed medical care I was able to go to the local urgent care office.
1	My doctor visits are follow up type that makes it easy to communicate with him any problems that I may be experiencing.my doctor asks me questions as well as I ask him questions.we have open communication which is best for my conditions
-1	I trust the doctors I see enough to keep going to them. I like the health system that I use I think they have really great nurses and doctors and a great reputable hospital. So I will trust them more than distrust
-1	i trust my doctor in y health care because he or she she know what they are doing that is all i have to say
1	He does everything he can to make me healthy!  He provides all my needs and is always there to help!
-1	Distrust as he's not always forthcoming. Had a recent incident which resulted in x-ray and he deliberately misdiagnosed it. Protecting someone.
-1	Some doctors tend to be lazy. Not all doctors can be trusted just because they are doctors. You have to trust them obviously because who else can you trust.
-1	I don't usually trust doctors to treat patients as individuals, but instead use a one size fits all approach, by which I mean over-issuing prescription medications instead of offering alternative solutions for curing and/or managing health conditions.
1	Doctor dont tell u everything they just trying to get paid just want u to take different medications
-1	My dr. Is ok but I'm not getting anywhere with her I feel like shot all the time and tell her how I feel and it seems like it goes in one ear and out the other without stoping
-1	Some of my specialists are excellent doctors, but others take an approach f get the meeting over with as fast as possible
-1	Sometimes I feel my doctor does everything by textbook without looking at the whole picture.  For example, she was going completely by BMI without looking at my body type.  I have a LOT of muscle as I work out often.  After examining me she agreed with me.  
1	I have a great trust in my doctor.  He lets me know how things are and if any changes need to be made he explains how and why.
-1	He has prescribed me a medication that could have caused serious harm due to an interaction with another medication I was on, which he knew I was taking. He has also prescribed me a medication that could have prevented me from having more children and did not mention this. He is also not as knowledgeable about my condition as he should be given that he specializes in the area. He works at an office that has incompetent staff across the board. I would use another office if my insurance allowed me to, but unfortunately they are the only option. 
1	My Primary care Physician is a HEALER, NOT A BUSINESSMAN, LIKE THESE YOUNG QUACKS THAT ARE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY. Outside of my father, he is the finest man I have ever encountered. 
-1	Sometimes they give you the wrong information . Or may say you have something and not tell you what to do about it. 
-1	When I had a life threatening illness my doctor made sure they monitored my condition  every step of the way.
-1	If I didn't trust my physician, I would change to another physician.  I have stuck with the doctors I have because I have developed a trust for them and their judgement.
-1	distrust has been established due to a mutual disrespect amongst myself and the non-medical personnel that staff the doctors office. As they seem to believe that they are well aware of how to treat me and better capable of handling it than I. 
-1	"She doesnt take the time to figure out my treatment optionsb she just goes with the first thing she knows. If she doesnt know of an alternative, she says its something i ""have to do"" regardless of negative side effects I've already experienced on that course of treatment. In my own personal reaearch i often discover multiple other avenues of treatment thay may work better for me, but she is unwilling to listen to my concerns."
-1	I sometimes trust doctors. There are good and Bad people in everything. Not all people are bad. I feel like they do the best they can to help people 
1	been going to my doctor for 40 years never had any promplems he doeas everyb thing he can to see I get the care I need to stay healthy
-1	I do not have a primary care physician at this time , but my husband and i are in the process of finding one and also going to have physicals done .

-1	my doctor always listens to what I have to say.  If i have a problem I make sure to let my doctor know.
-1	I do not trust doctors in General from past experiences.  This is in regards to family members not getting the care they needed in order to prevent death
-1	My Doctor spends a lot of time listening to me which makes me feel as though she truly wants the best for me. However, now and then she writes referrals or orders tests that I never hear about again and had nothing to do with my complaints.
1	My doctor and I have a very strong friendship as well as doctor/patient relationship. She listens to my opinions and thoughts and we make my health decisions together.
1	She has always been open with me about her feelings and suspicions as well as the eventual official diagnosis. She treats me with respect, and, even though she knows more than me, she doesn't talk down to me when she explains things.
-1	My doctor is very nice, she tends to be very caring straightforward, she never holds back information from me. She tends to be worried when I tell her something is wron
-1	I feel as though she listens to me and takes the time needed for my care. I do not feel rushed when I am see my Physician.
1	I've had my current doctor for three years now and he is the best doctor I've ever had. He is thorough in his assessments and is totally trustworthy.
-1	She listens does not make me feel in a hurry not many Doctors take the time to listen ,no useless test are done
1	My primary physician always gives options for care and leaves the decision up to me after explanations as to why he would suggest one option would be more beneficial than other.
-1	I mostly trust the doctor.   I believe with how the current healthcare system is, that there are unnecessary tests being done to give them extra money.
-1	i have a new dr so i trust her in a general way, don;t really know her. i do trust most dr.s Have had some good ones.
1	I cannot imagine any physician not having a patients best interest.  There are many avenues to go if that is not the case.  
-1	I just started with a new facility for my medical care.  The two doctors I have seen there so far seem to be very nice and helpful.  This is a walk in place, where you see whichever doctor is there, you don't need an appointment.
-1	I really don't go to the doctors, but when I did in the past they always treated me with compassion, and patience. 
1	My primary doctor shows empathy and actually listens to what i have to say to him. He's honest with me about everything. He tries his best to help me whether its getting a referral to someone else or getting information for me.
1	Very knowledgeable. Works for an excellent health system. Great bedside manner and caring. Takes the time to hear and address my concerns.  I don't feel rushed during my appointment.
1	My doctor has been reliable and honest with me.  She does not hesitate to question me when I have not followed her advice
-1	I see a do and not an md because a do treats the whole body and not just the symptoms.  I also see an acupuncturist on a regular basis.
1	I trust my doctorsâ because they know how to take care of me, take care of my needs and give me the right medicines and care.
-1	I have been with my current primary care doctor for over a year and he is very trustworthy. He explains diagnoses and treatment options in simple easy to understand language i understand. 
-1	I've been seeing her awhile. We talk bout things. I just trust her.  She listens to me, we talk about each issue. 
-1	I should be able to trust my Dr. I have no reason not to trust them. I have had no problems with any of the Dr.'s I have seen.
-1	She hasn't given me any reason not to trust her. She gives me plenty of her time, answers my questions, is friendly.
-1	my doctor is very through in way he does, he has me come every three months for a check up and to get my meds refilled and every 6 months he does my yearly and checks my blood, urine and checks my prostate
1	I trust my doctor because he has never told me information that he could not back up with scientific and medical proof.
1	I have been with my PCP for several years and I have grown to have more and more trust for him. Since Doctors are people too they can make mistakes or have errors in judgement. The one that graduates at the bottom of their class still gets the same credentials as one who graduates at the top.
-1	First off with my current Dr. I have researched that individual, and have spoken with people that have this particular Dr. as their Primary Care Physician. I check out the reviews online by individuals, and as well as the PCP's background information.
1	I have had my physicial for many years and she is always receptive and explains everything to me in depth. I feel that I could reach out to her whenever needed.
1	My doctor is very thorough, he always listens to everything that I have to say. He also makes sure that no stone is left unturned when it comes to my health.
1	I trust my doctor he's knowledgeable he knows my kids the next best to myself. They seriously help me 
-1	Sometimes people just look out for their own well being more than others no matter what profession. Also plenty of doctors have been wrong in diagnosing issues I'm having. They mask everything with medicine instead of treating the root cause. 
-1	I don't know that I actually trust my doctor, but I don't actually distrust her either. I guess I trust her to do what's best until she proves otherwise.
-1	"Primary care physicians usually are very straight forward with the facts and available treatments, but most are in and out types. Diagnosing the problem quickly without digging very deep into the situation, giving the usual treatment that has worked well for ""most others"" and not thinking whether or not the treatment would be best for you. "
1	I feel my doctor has my best interest in mind and treats me with dignity and respect at all times. I have no complaints about my treatment.
-1	I had galstones in Sept. Of 2015 and my doctor thought it was an ulcer. This made me sicker for longer, and I couldn't get the care I needed. That's why I distrust doctors sometimes.
1	i consider my doctor a friend. he is very open and honest to me even when he knows i might not like his advise.
-1	i see my doctor once a year she is very nice and easy to talk to good at having tests down and prescribes the medications i need
-1	Trust him because he will find the right medication instead of just giv g one and hoping it will eventually work. He also wants the right dosage and will keep checking to make sure they work
-1	I don't have a primary care physician anymore. I don't really get sick. I just kinda play things by ear and go from there.
1	She explains all my medications are for and what any procedure is for and why. I have trust in her. I can get appointment in between my regular appointments if needed without any problems.
1	My primary care person is actually a NP that i have been seeing for years. She gets me, my actual PCP supervises her but does not get me and i am not fond of her bedside manner.
1	He never jumps to conclusions, he will talk to me about what ever it is and do tests if that's what is needed. 
-1	I don't trust them as much as I use tro. They do not take the time to learn about you and listen to your concerns it is a joke.
1	He has helped with some of my medical issues when other doctors didn't. He listens well to everything I say and makes you feel comfortable. 
-1	I feel that she wants what is best and is honest and has my well being first when it comes to me and my health
-1	I trust him, he is very nice and kind and seems to care about his patients and wants what is best for them
-1	I don't necessarily distrust my physician, but the medical field in general. I don't discredit their knowledge, but don't trust their motives. It's all about money to most medical practices.
-1	"The reason I trust and don't trust doctors is because I feel that a large majority of them are financially driven and often give responses to clients/patients based off of biases. I also believe that even some honest doctors tend to sometimes fall victim to having to concede to company policy's and ""unethical"" medical industry standards."
1	Doctors and nurses ppl must have full trust in and clinic and hospitals along with billing and paper work 
-1	doctors are paid by number of tests and other billable transactions they can perform on patient.  so they are only interested in increasing the number of tests and unnesessary operations for no health benefit.  need single payer health care
-1	I have had great doctors and I have had bad doctors. It takes research and checking them out before you trust a doctor.
-1	i would hope i can trust my physician, nobody really knows someone 100% so sometimes there is room for doubt
-1	My primary care doctor gives me options to different medical situations; if she feels I need to see a particular type of specialist for my condition, then she refers me to one.
1	I had a serious medical problem two years ago and my primary care doctor has been great with all the following up that has to be done and have explained everything to me the time.
1	My doctor doesn't try to pressure or shame me into doing anything or taking any medication that he feels I need if I object. He respects my opinion.
-1	I really like my PCP. He listens and relys on my instincts as to what is going on. He is geniuinely nice and appreciative of my time and efforts.
1	He takes the time to listen to me thoroughly.  He gives me advice that makes sense and has been proven to be valid and true in the past.  He cares about me (remembers things I have mentioned), and seems genuinely please when things are going well for me.  During one crisis I had about 5 years ago, he called me a few days later to make certain I was all right.
-1	He seems to know what he is doing and I rarely see him for anything outside of being sick which I rarely am
1	I have been with my doctor for 15 years.  She is awesome and has made me feel completely comfortable with all of my health care questions and needs.  I travel almost an hour to see her as her practice moved.  I have no qualms about driving that distance because I know I am getting superior health care.
-1	I see a nurse practitioner in a clinic and he always takes time with me, never seems in a rush. Willing to get things tested if I wish, if it's not an urgent matter. 
1	In my lifetime of 79 years I have had no reason to distrust my doctors. I have done research into my choice of physicians and am therefore confident that they are trustworthy.
-1	I do not even have a primary care physician. I have not seen a doctor in years. I am in good health and do not need to visit a physician for any problems. 
1	I have a new primary care physician who is very cordial, friendly, smiley, smart, and caring. He looks at you and listens carefully to what you say and responds very politely and respectfully. He explains things nicely and with details and examples. He takes his time with you and makes sure he's answered all of your questions before the session is over. He doesn't order unnecessary tests or medications. He is great!
-1	"i don't trust someone that i can't understand. i don't appreciate being ""talked over"" because i am not understanding what they are saying. i will not go back to that doctor, unless i absolutely have to because i care about my life and well being more than some stranger with a diploma does. when i find a doctor that treats me like the intelligent human being that i am, i am more willing to listen and discuss my concerns with them. if not, they are plenty of doctors that i will go to until i find one willing to co-operate with me."
-1	she is curt, rolls her eyes when i tell her what is going on with my body, she is dismissive. she doesn't tell me stuff like do not  take your thyroid pill before your blood work, so my blood work is screwed up, i know she does not believe things i have had tested or experienced in the past are true facts. they are quite oddities and hard to believe, but yet all of them tested at least 3x before the dr's back then believed what was going on. it is my fault i am still with her, but my file could probably go around the earth once. i am lazy and honestly do not want to fill out new patient info sheets. when i do see a new dr, i have them send me the forms and it usually takes me about 3-5 days to fill them out.  i am content to know what i am dealing with my mean dr.
-1	Doctors are in it for the money from the health care industry. Doctors do not listen to their patients.  All they want to do is write scripts and not solve problems holistically.
-1	I think most doctors are trying their best to provide good care but you really need to be your own advocate when it comes to your health. If something  doesn't  feel right or you are not getting better, get a second or even third opinion. 
-1	I trust that he knows what he is doing and that he wants whats best for me and my health. Ive also have never had a problem with my doctor.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been seeing my doctor since I was 3 and he has never disappointed me 
-1	they do not listen or read my chart when I tell them something, Its like I tell them and they look at me as if I have two heads
-1	I've been put on meds that ended me up having renal failure and hospitalized. I had another doctor prescribe something that didn't work well with another medication. I'm overly cautious.
-1	She has always been earnest with me about whatever I when to see her about. She has never beat around the bush when it comes to my health.
-1	he takes the time to listen and explore options with me. he listens thoroughly and consults when necessary
-1	I don't believe my doctor has read my medical history and pays any attention to me when I try to address it. The doctor is constrained by some CDC guidelines  which have left my issues untreated for years now and now I suffer more issues so I no longer trust my health care office and they also gave me a vaccine that I had refused for years and I decided to not worry about it until the bill came for $375 that insurance will not pay and that I do not have. I no longer trust them and don't feel I have anywhere to turn for medical care at this time.
-1	doctors dont seem to care like they used to.  They rush thru the appts just to make that money.  They dont listen nor do they act like they care about what you are saying.  
-1	Depends on the expertise of the doctor. If he/she is a specialist then I have a little more faith in the diagnosis. 
-1	i don't know my primary physician well enough as I never used him more than once a year so I really can't say.  Now that I'm older, I'll use him more
1	He has always took time to listen to my concerns or questions, makes sure he answers and acknowledges everything I say or ask. He always makes sure I know how to contact him via the offices site and e-mail if I have any further questions or concerns.
-1	My doctor is pretty good at being very diligent and listening to me and answering all my questions and exploring all treatment options.
-1	It seems that it depends on what mood she is in..maybe in a hurry at times and doesn't appear to be thorough
1	She is very smart about what is new .When ever I call emergency, she takes me on . She never knocks me down .Explains every thing an never rushes me out !!! 
1	The reason I trust primary care physician is because because they always explain test, results and procedures in a way that I can understand exactly was is happenings
-1	he is considerate and open with helping me with my illnesses almost always right and usually gives me choices
-1	I don't necessarily distrust them, but overall they just want the salary and some of them are being paid by pharmaceutical companies for certain drugs 
1	My doctor knows me and understands me.  He cares and is very educated.  He never talks down to me and talks in words that I can understand.
-1	I think doctors try to push too many drugs and don't give alternative and lifestyle treatments that would be better.
-1	I basically go to the doctors once a year and always listen and ask questions of my doctor.  We usually have a good conversation about different things and I walk away learning a new thing or two.
-1	My doctor is a good doctor, but her staff is not very responsive to patients needs. She doesn't understand my personal problems as well as she should.
-1	I have not been with my primary care physician for a long time so I can't say that I fully trust him at this time.
-1	i trust her because she always listens to me and helps me out all the time makes sure that i feel safe and any test i want done or need done she does it i like it its nice 
-1	I have found in the past with primary care physicians I've had that they are interested in providing me with prescriptions I don't need and calling it preventative. 
-1	I believe that many doctors will run unnecessary tests to make a quota set my their practice.  For instance, a dermatologist may do a biopsy when there is not a good reason.   
-1	"I've had a bad history with doctors. They tend to condescend to me, to pick on me for my weight until I get compulsive and self-destructive about my eating habits, and give me drugs that wreak lasting havoc on my system and then just shrug it off (""Oh, well, that doesn't happen to most people.""). This one seems good, like he actually listens, but I'm still wary."
-1	I trust my primary care physician to try to do what is best for me. However I realize he may be constrained by insurance restrictions or influence by drug manufactures.
1	I trust my doctor since i have enough time dealing with him and also i entrust is to my family and my friens and colleagues
1	My primary care physician does not make recommendations lightly and explains decisions carefully. He listens to my concerns.
-1	I don't really feel either, i don't know them enough but they do help if i need it.  they can guide me but don't just give me all the answers, and they have ok ratings.
-1	I trust my doctor because he has been the whole family doctor and has been treating me since birth also has answered all questions i've ever had bout me and my family members
-1	They don't listen to the patient.  They give you therapy before they even xray anything.  Everything is either your dehydrated, to walk, go check your eyes and other hairbrained answers.  I wish old school doctors still existed.  These young ones are terrible.
1	Because I've been seeing him for years and I haven't had a any problems, He's good and professional 
-1	All doctors treat you for symptoms you dont need medical attention for. They get a kick from certain medications, so they convince you to take it. We have proven it. A doctor told (Ã) to take (said medication), and (+) didnt take it, and after 6 months, there was no difference.     I only take mine when I need to.
-1	I trust her and ask questions as I need to about health issues or concerns. I can ask questions about different medications or choices that I have   
1	My doctor listens to me and explains test results clearly. If I have any questions he takes the time to answer them. He doesn't rush through anything.
-1	I mainly trust the doctors that I see or my children but I definatly make sure that we agree upon a treatment
1	"I've dealt with a heart issue since I was 8 yrs old. Had a major ""episode"" almost 3 years ago & my current PCP has been very open about theories, treatments, test results & options. He has listened to my questions/concerns as well as let me participate in my care as far as refusing or suggesting a similar or different course."
-1	I tend to trust Doctors that listen to my concerns more so than Doctors that talk at me with a know it all attitude.
1	I have a great relationship with my doctor.  I trust him completely for my care.  He does a great job.  I would listen to his advice and suggestions. 
-1	i trust my doctors to a certain extent but you cannot trust anyone completely. i dont have any specific complaints about my current doctors. 
-1	I do not completely trust my doctors because I don't have a primary care physician and I see different doctors when I go to the doctor.
1	It is his job to give his patients the best care and treatment. If not, he could be sued, and could potentially lose his license 
1	I trust my doctors they usually tell me the truth about my health weather I want to hear it or not i learned alot about my health by asking questions  also i learned alot of medical terms 
-1	it seems to work out just fine for me. I find that i can trust doctors pretty easily and have no issue in that regard because i have never had any reason to not trust them. so it works in my favor. 
-1	Don't always spend enough time or ask if you have any questions. Just want to get you in and out. Therefore how can one totally trust if they don't get to know you as a person.
-1	After listening to my concerns the doctor prescribed the medication that would best handle my medical condition
1	I feel like I can trust my doctor because he sees you as a person and not just getting some kind of money benefit from his patients and cares for each one no matter who they are or the financial differences. He shows respect and trays to make everyone comftorable and like a friend.
-1	At times, my doctor seems more focused on generating money than actually treating me. I have had several tests that seemed unnecessary. 
-1	My doctor is pretty straight forward is sensitive but to the point.  I must trust he only has my best interest at heart
-1	They don't always take my concerns into account. They are in a hurry to get me out of the office a lot of the time 
1	He is friendly and really interested in what you have to say and is never hurried when speaking and treating me,   He diagnosed my wife's condition just by looking at her after several other doctors had no idea what her medical problem was.
-1	I recently had to switch primaries and she isn't as easy to talk to nor as thorough. I always feel rushed when I see her
-1	My PCP is associated with a family practice facility that trains family practice physicians.  He is attentive and represents what I would expect of a family practice physician.
-1	Doctors are good for diagnoses, but prescribing medication is one thing I do not trust doctors in this area. I believe medications are prescribed for the doctors benefit, not the patient.
1	I trust my doctor completely, he has the knowledge to tell me all the options that I have for what is wrong with me.  We will talk it over and come up together with what we are going to do.
-1	I feel like my primary care doctor has a lot to accomplish by stating what might be wrong with me but also feel like they are just doing their job 
-1	I have had alot of experience in dealing with doctors because I took care of my ageing parents. I do know that sometimes doctors do whats easy for them and they look at the ageing elderly as if their life is almost over anyway. For that reason and others I dont truely trust every word my doctor tells me. I get second opinions first.
1	I've been going to see him a long time and he tells me the truth...even when it's hard to hear.  He never spares my feelings and always shoots straight with me.  I really appreciate it and trust everything he says.
-1	My primary care physician seems inexperienced and doesn't give an educated opinion of my symptoms. She doesn't ask many questions of give helpful solutions to my medical problems.
-1	The doctor's experience, Your level of education, Your work experience, Their industrial-level status
1	because he has not steered me wrong and has treated for years. Furthermore, he has sent to me to several specialist who were both professional and excellent doctors as well. He carefully explains any medication changes that he makes and why he is making them, and he listens to me.
1	its hard to trust sometimes. sometimes they are just there for the money, and some really do care about you
1	He explains things well. I never feel rushed during a visit. He takes time to answer all my questions.
-1	I trust her because I know that she listens to me and what I have to say. However I don't think that she agrees with my diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, which was diagnosed long before she became my doctor, and so I feel she does not really believe the pain that I am in. She also seems to be always looking for another reason for my pains. Which I have been through numerous times with other doctors. So I don't always trust her to believe me. 
-1	I generally trust doctors, but also have some degree of skepticism and will ask questions of medical providers until satisfied with the answers I have received.
-1	i view my doctor a partner in giving me the best advice from their professional point of view, but at the end it's really my decision to make
-1	My doctor is friendly and sincere, but more and more she seems a bit hurried in getting me in and out. I still generally trust her, but would appreciate more time or discussion
-1	Doctors are only as knowledgeable as they are taught and what is told to them by the pharmacy industry. 
-1	I someti,es feel that my best interests are not met. I feel like the dr is doing things that require me to have to spend more versus dealing with the issue at hand.
-1	My primary care physician is very intelligent and knowledgeable.  However their are conditions that he does not know the details of and when questioned he dismisses concern.  He is not likely to discuss emotional reactions to anything.  That is fine with me but he has patients that are upset about that aspect.  He is very clinical.  He trusts lab tests for most everything.  I trust him but wish her was a little more curious about symptoms.  It is possibly an age thing as he is ready to retire.
1	I have been with my primary care physician for almost 20 years.  He discusses everything with me and utilizes my input into treatment plans.
1	He's a great guy that truly wants me to be as healthy as I can. I swear he wants me to live to 150, happily, healthy, and active.
-1	My doctor always seems to know what the correct diagnosis is for any given thing for which I consult him. Sometimes he's a little rushed but he does try to make conversation and show interest in my life outside of whatever medical issue is at hand.
-1	My doctor explains my condition with good verbal skills and help me understand his medications and the way to take them and how to use them.
-1	For the most part, I feel that they are most knowlegeable about medicine. I have no reason not to trust their judgement for most health information.
1	I have had a bad experience with another doctor.  She is very through and concerned.  She listens and takes her time. 
1	I have complete trust in my physician,been going to for 15 years.never had a problem.knows what doing.office staff friendly,clean,and askes how your doing.
1	He takes time with me, listens to me and is very responsive and honest.  He is caring and personable, easy to talk to.  
1	I have been with my primary care doctor for 11 years.  I trust his decisions where my healthy is concerned and he has been right on.
-1	My doctor is new so I don't really know her that well.  I will however put trust into her degree. She belongs to a good insurance organization also. 
-1	I trust that they know what they're doing, but sometimes it seems they are trying to rush you in and out because they have other people to treat 
1	My doctor thoroughly explains procedures and options I may have, helping me make the best choice.  She patiently answers all my questions.  She consults with specialists I see to be sure that her treatment will not interfere with theirs.
1	I have never had a doctor recommend anything that was harmful for me. My doctor's have always been sure that i understand everything going on with me. 
1	I completely trust my primary care physician because she is so thorough at each visit.  She really listens to me intently.  I never feel like she is in a hurry.  After she addresses what issues I came for, she always ask how I have been.
1	I trust her because she seems to really care about me and really listens to what I have to say. She doesn't dismiss what I have to say, big or small.  Nothing I talk to her about feels silly to talk or ask her about 
-1	My primary care physician is a local p/a but is not afraid to refer me to specialists in larger cities as necessary
-1	In the 1950's a medical career was a vocation of helping others despite the fact that it paid much more in respect than money. By the late 1960's medical school had become a hard, but sure way to wealth. Too many are focused on the payoff today. 
-1	I have been with the same doctor for 18 years.  I trust him to make the right decisions concerning my health. 
-1	I generally trust my doctor because she is highly educated and has gone through years of training in her profession.
1	I trust my doctor because he listens and is open to what I have to say or suggest. He also is very good at explaining things and various options available for whatever I may need. (for example: medication options) 
1	I trust my doctor because I have been going to her for a while and she has always taken good care of me and always been honest and upfront with me about things.
1	I trust my doctor because I have been a patient for over 30 years. I respect my doctor in providing good care towards me.
-1	for the most part I trust my various drs, and follow their recommendations. however when it comes to taking prescription medications, I am reluctant to add any to the ones I already take, and feel that sometimes drs are too ready to pull out the rx pad.
1	Good communication is a must with your doctor. Mine is a very relaxed and sincere man.  He gives me his attention and takes his time to make sure everything is clear and that I have no questions.  He explains everything fully and has a game plan for how to proceed forward, and I love that about him.
-1	I do not have a long relationship with my doctor but am confident that they are skilled and motivated to address my issues. 
1	It is very reliable since my whole family goes with it. Makes his job perfect, is an honest, responsible, caring and professional person. So I fully rely on your capabilities.
-1	i trust my doctor because he has never been wrong or told me anything just to get money out of me, he is a very honest and caring doctor
-1	i have only met my primary care physician once. i do not tend to trust most people so doctors are no exception to that rule.
1	I trust my doctor because I have not found anything to distrust them about. I understand what he tells me and it always seems to fit with what diagnosis he has for me. I make sure to look up things and learn about them and nothing has ever raised my suspicions that my doctor is wrong or way of base.
1	My primary care physician has never done anything to cause me to distrust him. Every time I've needed assistance I've been met with high quality service and solutions.
-1	They are self serving like all humans, which means they can't be trusted. This is true for any given example involving humans and trust. However, individuals can be trusted. The problem is there are too many doctors and not enough caring people. Doctors want to line their pockets in gold and caring people want to actually help. Unfortunately, there are little to no caring people left in this world. Doctors sign up knowing the work will he hard, then when they actually see it is difficult, they just give up and turn into worthless meat sacks like everyone else. They commit themselves to a life a servitude then do nothing of the sort. They are profoundly hypocritical in most aspects, and far too lazy to truth know how to, or be able, to help. Doctors are worthless in our society. Until I actually see one personally that is willing to deal with the rabble and listen to my personal, legitimate problems as just that, I will never trust, nor respect those morons. 
-1	because i trust my primary care physician and i have complete trust in my doctor. My doctor is totally honest
1	I trust my doctor thouroughly. She let's me know what works and doesn't work. She is truly intetested in me as a patient and her nurses have called after a sick visit to see how I'm doing. She's awesome. 
-1	for the most part I trust some of my doctors.  I don't have a primary care physician but I have other doctors I see regularly.
1	I have been with him for a long time. He listens to what  I have to say and works hard to make sure that he gives me good care and treatment and gets me feeling better. If there is something he feels he can not help me with he will find someone who can treat me better
-1	Somties we must make hard decisions and know what is best for our health and i dont think a physician has all the awnsers
1	My dr is caring and competent. She listens to me and always is able to pinpoint and fix my problem. I trust her opinion and feel confident she has my best interest at heart
-1	All my trust is and will remain in God.  I only trust Him an if He assigns a doctor for me I believe that he will use her in a honest way.
1	My doctor has never steered  me  wrong or had me  do anything  without listening to my concerns . He  explains things to me in simple language.
-1	I do not trust doctors at all it seems there thing is to give a pill for a pill and this side effect will outweigh this side effect
1	Because he was my student in high school; I know him well; we have a strong bond and I know that he would not tell me to do anything that he wouldn't tell his own parents.
-1	he tells me everything needed for each visit why and the whats in very detailed and common English which is very easy to under stand
-1	My primary care doctor has a good bedside manner,she's very thorough when she explains everything to me.She tells me what she thinks I need or don't need for my care.
1	My physician has always been very open about what she thinks I should do about any condition that I am curious about at the time.  She has always been very thorough in her explanation of things and questions me as to whether I have any questions at all.
1	My doctor  is a do.She is there first do primary care doctor I have had. She is  more holistic in her approach to patient care. I like that.
-1	I've been with my doctor for 10 years and I trust her and I'm very healthy person so I tend to only see her once a year 
-1	The doctors I see now are always open and up front with me about the treatment I am receiving. Because of this, I trust their judgement in making a diagnosis and the possible treatment(s).
-1	I trust my PCP as I have been seeing her more than ten years and she has helped me through a number of illnesses, chronic and other. 
-1	This one is hard to answer because my old doctor retired and I now have a new doctor that I've only seen once.  She seems ok, but very different than my previous doctor who was really personable.  She is more professional and not really into have a relationship with her patients.
1	I trust my doctor because she takes the time to explain things to me, answer my questions and have a discussion with me regarding my health.
1	I have been with my doctor for a long time. If he doesn't know the answer to my question he will find out for me. He is very caring and attentive towards me about my problems.
-1	I think a lot of doctors these days, especially young ones, are not that concerned with taking the time need to solve a medical problem. They want to take the easy course, get paid and move on to the next patient.
-1	they have always been honest with me and take care of me all i have to do is call them and they will work me in
-1	I don't have a regular physician at the moment but when I do I stick with one who I feel is great at their job
1	 All my doctors have always given me competent information and competent care. I trust them very much.
-1	These days I feel that doctors care (with some exceptions) more about their bottom line than their patients.  Not so long ago I believed everything that my doctors would tell me but not any longer.  I was particularly miffed when a former orthopedist had no clue as to how to help me after I fractured my hip and got really upset when I sought a second opinion and had the other doctor operate on me.
-1	he listens and explains things very well.my family has been a patient of his for over twelve years and everyone understands his explainations and plans for treatment.
-1	I tend to trust my physician inasmuch as he knows me for nearly 30 years and I know him well enough to know when I'm getting short shrift.
-1	I am doing fine and very healthy and nothing wrong with me. I am non-smoker, non-drinker, non-drug, and stay out of trouble, etc. I have one indoor cat. 
-1	It seems to me that most if not all doters are working for pharmsudical companies to try new drugs on unsuspecting patients,which seldom works on individual people rather than the majority
1	I trust my DR as he is always kind and asks all the right questions and spends time with me also I never call unless I am really sick and he always sees me the same day
1	I've seen the same person for several years and we have developed a rapport with each other. I trust her to tell me the truth.
-1	In general, I would say I trust doctors since they are the professionals and they know what they are doing. Being able to become a doctor would imply that you are well educated in that area and have an adequate understanding.
1	My previous Doctor took time to explain everything to me. I never felt rushed. He knew my medical condition and always provided me with the latest and best treatment for me. 
1	never has given me a reason not to trust him seems open and honest if i ask something takes the time to explain

-1	I trust my doctor based on her reputation and referrals.  but have not been with them long enough to build that trust on a long term basis.
-1	I do not see a primary care physician. I prefer holistic medicine, ie. natural or herbal medications, essential oils & studying changes in diet to aid in healing the body naturally. Our bodies were created to heal themselves. The use of synthetic medications tend to cause other physical side effects. They focus on the symptoms rather than the root problem causing the symptoms.
1	My doctor takes time and listen to what's going on with me. Takes time and doesn't rush. Takes time to explain
1	I have only been going to him for 6 months but his dad has been a doctor in town for 30 years. He seems to be caring, knowledgeable and a good listener.

1	i trust my LNP greatly, she recently listened to me and wrote me a RX for an Ultrasound. We discovered my gall bladder was full of sludge(pre stone condition) , I now cann look forward to finally some relief. 
1	I trust my care provider she has been very understanding and very helpful with my needs she has also called my house with different concerns which is unusual for doctors to do nowadays
-1	he knows what is best for me  they care about what happens to people because of their health. Doctors care I believe
-1	I trust my doctor because I can talk openly with her and she takes the time needed during my appointments
-1	I've never been given a reason to distrust a doctor I've seen. I've always been given information and had my questions answered in a reasonable manner. 
-1	I trust them because they went to school for being a doctor or physician I don't trust them because of the reason they push lots and lots of medicine on people when the main thing they need to tell the patient is to eat healthy and stop being sedentary 
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part and he does spend time with me when I have questions.  If he does not have answers to my questions about a specific problem, he would send me to a specialist.
-1	I trust my doctor in regards to being thorough with my medical needs but he has hundreds of patients so sometimes it feels like I'm not getting his total attention.
1	I trust my doctor because he discusses things candidly and in ways I can understand. He always answers any questions and takes my wants into consideration. He is open to exploring any treatments that might benefit me and is honest about side effects and reasons why or why not something may be a good idea. 
-1	I don't trust doctors because when I had my son they gave me to much blood pressure meds, which cause my blood pressure to drop uncomtrolably with out stoping so much to the point where I need oxygen 
1	I trust my primary care physicians because they are honest & upfront with me. They don't tell me what I want to hear.
1	No matter what my condition was or is mu primary care physician was able to make a correct diagnosis 100% of the time.
1	My primary care physicians takes the time to talk to me, even discussing things that are going on with my family and work that might be affecting my health. She seems truly concerned about my well-being.
1	My doctor is open and honest with me. He is very thorough in his examinations and he seems to listen to what I'm saying to him. 
-1	I trust my primary care physician based on the relationship that developed.  She discusses the latest information.  She is also an instructor. 
-1	Because every Dr I been too has mix diagnosed me,missed broken ribs,an tell u anything an think u are drug seeking. But don't care if you are actually in pain or sick
-1	I think she has so many patients so I feel like a number. I also thinl she wants to prescribe certain medications. I assume rhere are kickbacks 
-1	I do trust what the doctor has to say almost all the time. If it is something pricey and serious, I will get a second opinion.
-1	I don't distrust them. I place very high trust in them because they have been through years of school so that they can be in a place where they are.
1	My primary care physician spends a lot of time with me.  He has even come in on his day off to see me.  He listens to my opinions, respects them, and is open in discussing issues with me.
1	he is willing to work with me and try other ways instead of adding more medicine that would be more harmful then helpful
-1	It is not that I distrust my primary care doctor but that I am fully aware they are human and humans make mistakes and or tend to miss things that aren't obvious so I am a strong advocate in believing in my gut and getting a second opinion if I have any doubts 
-1	Doctors make extra money by referring to other doctors and by prescribing certain medicines. That is counter to my best interests. I take what the doctor recommends with a grain of salt.
1	I basically trust doctors because they have more knowledge than I do. I do not completely trust anyone.  If my doctor says or suggests something I do not agree on I will question her. If I ever feel I can't trust my doctor I will find a new doctor
1	this is a get one for me.being going for a long time.i like very much.he is the best one for me.that is why i go to him.
-1	I trust my primary. I believe they would never tell me nothing wrong, or give me something that's not good for me. An the same goes for my kids. I have trust in my primary doctor, and believe he/she will not harm me and my family.
-1	At the moment, I am in between a primary care physician.  I have been with an internal medicine doctor as my primary care doctor for almost 30 years and for the last two years (I go in once a year for a physical checkup), I feel I wasted my time.  He read my blood work and didn't even ask if I had any questions or problems to address.  I now have an appoint next month to see a new internal medicine doctor.
1	i trust my doctor because she takes her time with me to find out what is best for me. she also gives me advice on what kind of medications that would be good for my condition
-1	I am neutral about whether I trust or distrust doctors because there are many factors involved. You sometimes have to see different doctors and the circumstances are different for each one. 
1	I have been with him for over 10 years and we have developed a trust. If I had to find a new doctor, I would have a hard time finding one that I have the same kinds of relationship with.
-1	I trust my primary care physician to a point.  I trust her to know mainstream illnesses such as flu, colds, strep, UTIs, etc.  I would not have full confidence in her medical knowledge in more rare or extreme illnesses due to her age and lack of experience - she is barely 30 years old.  Also, I fully research any recommendations to verify her information.
-1	feel that she is rushed and doesn't have the time to address my concerns. i'd like to try a different type of a medication and also manage my chronic conditions better
-1	He's fine for check ups but quick to refer me to a specialist without trying a treatment first.  After I see the specialist, my family doctor defers to them and doesn't stay in the loop.
-1	My doctor has a lot of patients so she has to see them all she might miss something I need medically 
-1	i have little trust in doctors.I have had to fire them because of their care less and evil verbal abuse.When give detailed testing procedures I had to refuse the action as it was a sure failure and would spread the current infection.I was offered perscriptions that were incorrect.I knew what would work but the doctor did not know for one month.Had I not been able to deal with the infection I would lost a life.
1	I have been with them for years and they have a great practice and have never made me second guess anything that they have done. I actually need to go back.
-1	He does take the time to pay attention to me and answer my questions.  He is about ready to retire and I am saddened about that.  These EHR mandates are a source of trouble for him
-1	my primary care physician helped save my life, he was able to find, diagnose and treat an illness that could have killed me
-1	I trust her because I think and hope that she has my best interest at heart... There's always a 24 hour hotline just in case I need help in the middle of the night. She's always supportive
-1	I trust them, She isVery in tune with me. She listens to me, she takes her time.  She doesn't rush you through and not listen
-1	I have been with my doctor fer a lot of years as well as he was my fathers doctor. He is more then competent as well as being a trusted source of medical needs and advice.
1	I have no reason not to trust my physicians. They have always given me information that is thorough and thoughtful.
1	We have a great dialogue with  each other. He seems to actually listen to me, unlike other doctors in my past.
-1	I don't completely trust my doctor because I don't feel like I can trust any doctor after previous experiences with bad doctors. However, I feel like my doctor genuinely wants to help me and cares about what happens to me, I just don't think they always tell me what my best option of treatment is all the time, etc.
-1	To be honest, I haven't been to a primary care physician in many many year.  If I did go see one, I would have a great deal of trust. 
-1	My primary care doctor has changed 3 times in the last year.  I totally trust my gynecologist and cardiologist.  Sometimes doctors want to charge insurance companies for additional testing.  Sometimes they don't want to tell you that you should maybe see a different specialist.
1	I trust my doctor because he has been around for many years and has the experience in treating pretty much everything. 
1	always trust my doctor all the time and he totally helps me take care of myself and my family all the time
-1	I trust my doctor for the most part. I feel that he will do right by me but sometimes I feel I am being rushed. I can not think of anything else to say.
1	I trust her implicitly. She is thorough, asks questions, actually listens to my answers and answers my questions. She is friendly,  seems really interested in me.
1	I get a very strong impression that my doctor is looking out for my best interests and she is very knowledgeable about my conditions. 
-1	I trust my doctors because they have been there for me and have helped me find medical conditions that I didn't know existed and without them something bad could have happened.
-1	I trust them because I have been going there for a long time and like all of them and know they would do anything for me and my health.
-1	It just seems doctors are to eager to get to the next patient. They never spend enough time with you.
-1	Sometimes I feel my clinical doctors are overwhelmed with too many patients and just skim the chart of the patient before him. His skimming the page can hardly relay too much confidence on said patient. 
1	I distrust the doctor sometimes because I'm unable at times to get proper medicine I need for pain. However, I do trust the doctor with filling me in on information about my health.
-1	I've known too many doctors to do things in a rush. I wish they would of sat and had  a conversation with me, instead of telling me what needed to be done, cause some things aren't actually necessary. 
1	I completely trust my primary care because I left his practice for 1 year many years ago and I got very sick. And the new doctor could not help me.. I went back to him and stayed and told him I would not leave again. It been over 25 years.
-1	That is hard to answer with any amount of certainty as my primary doctor has just retired and I have only had one contact with my new doctor.  That appointment went satisfactory -  but don't know the whole picture.
-1	I trust doctors because they have medical experience and know more than I do That is why I go to them when I am sick or have a medical problem
-1	Often times its feels as if the primary care physicians, allergists, and other doctors will sometimes make things worse than what they really are at the time. Sometimes it is like they want the patient to spend more money out of pocket and constantly come back for nothing.
-1	I feel that my doctor is completely up front and honest in all aspects that I deal with him. he has a very good reputation.
1	Typically doctors are there for your well-being and they have no interest in being dishonest or holding out on you usually they want what's best for you and will give you the best informed information about what is best for your condition and how to diagnose it and take care of it properly
-1	Now a days physicians could care less about patients its about money to them sadly to say...there isnt much more to say other than that
-1	i'd like to think most doctors are good. some out there are terrible and just want to make more money. but there are plenty good ones out there to trust
1	I have researched my physician thoroughly and I have known her for a very long time.  She always has my best interests in mind and has proven herself trustworthy.
1	i trust my primary care physician because I have been seeing them for many years and they have always been very caring and helpful no matter the situation. i also trust them because i think they want to have a good reputation so they do their best with me as a patient.
-1	I trust because they talk to me and explain all my option and care about my needs always there in an emergency
-1	Because my doctor asks what medications I need. He knows I do my research. My doctor knows that I am a therapist.
1	I trust my primary care physician. I've seen this physician for many years and have never had a problem discussing concerns or listening to what to do to be proactive in my health.
-1	I have been having some health issues and they are not really sure what is wrong with me.  We are testing multiple theories but it is frustrating 
-1	Doctors like my primary care physician are mostly thinking about the pharmaceutical companies and the bonuses they get while masking the problems and side effects as care to their patients.
-1	I trust my primary care physician because my mother used the same one. Also, my physician is caring, kind and considerate to me when I visit. 
1	i have a long term relationship with my doctor and can talk frankly with him. we un derstand each other and he knows my history very well
-1	I trust most doctors. My office is full of residents, with full fledged doctors overseeing them.  They are usually thorough, however, a few have been known to rush me & do what they want & not listen to me.
-1	My doctor always listens to my concerns and addresses them in a timely manner. I don't feel neglected or rushed when I am at my  appointment. 
1	I have complete trust in my doctor. He has been my doctor for at least 20 years. He is caring and compassionate. believe he truly cares about me as a patient and friend. He convinced me that I have a long life to live if I take care of myself. I lost over 100 pounds with his encouragement. I believe that I can tell him anything.
1	I hadn't seen a doctor in many years when I found my current one, and she has always been upfront and forthright with me about my medical conditions, She has helped me get used to the medications I have to take, always explains why I'm getting them and always answers all my questions to my satisfaction
-1	I trust them but plan to do further research regarding conditions I visit the doctor for before completely trusting treatment options
1	I DO NOT KNOW IF MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ALWAYS HAS MY BEST INTEREST AT HEART. I AM NEW TO HIS PRACTICE AND HAVE NOT FULLY MADE UP MY MIND ON HIM. 
-1	I think he has my best interests at heart, although he appears to be overworked with the number of patients he sees (Veterans Admin).
-1	My doctor does not always take time when I see him.  He hardly spends time with me. That is all I have to say.
1	I have been told by another doctor that my doctor is one of the best in his field, which is a great complement. When one course of action comes to a halt, he always has another course of action to take.
-1	I don't have any reason not to trust them. I haven't had any issues come up because I've trusted and taken their advice in the past. I don't think they would tell me false information.
-1	well Trust is, of course, essential to both physician and patient. Without trust, how could a physician expect patients to reveal the full extent of their medically relevant history, expose themselves to the physical exam, or act on recommendations for tests or treatments? Trust promotes efficient use of both the patient's and the physician's time. Without trust, the process of informed consent for the most minor of interventions, even a prescribed antibiotic, would become as time consuming as that needed for major surgery.rust may even have therapeutic value, enhancing the efficacy of prescribed treatment.22 Most importantly, trust in the doctor caring for them is of great importance to patients. Patients who trust their doctors rate their care more favorably, as demonstrated by Keating et al.23 in this issue, as well as by others.20,24 Numerous open-ended studies of patients' views about their care, in a variety of contexts, most of which did not include specific hypotheses about trust, have found that patients spontaneously discuss trust and its importance, adding
1	He has been there every step of the way. He make me feel comfortable about dealing with my illness. 
1	Doctors are humans, and make mistakes.   Patients are individuals, and not a one fit works for all of us.   What may work perfectly for others, may be an awful thing for me.   
-1	I do not put my full trust in doctors because most do not care for your health unless they are getting paid.  If you have no insurance they set you aside than rather to assist you.
-1	My doctor was going to give Zoloft to my husband for anxiety knowing that he has heart problems. She also wants me on pain management and I don't want to do that. 
1	Doctor  John Smith in Springfield is my doctor. He is the kindest and considerate person I have ever had as a doctor. The one I had before was Jane Doe, she was mean rude and could care less about me. She should never have become a doctor. She hates people, I was not the only person that she mistreated.
-1	Doctors are human and as such are not above making mistakes and missing things that should have been observed and so we have to remember this and question things along the way.
-1	I don't have a regular doctor at all I don't have health insurance so if I get sick or something I have to go to the emergency room
1	I have had the same primary care physician for somewhere between 10-15 years.  Moreover, I have gone to the same practice for more than 25 years, so there is a good file built up of my records.
-1	I believe sometimes a doctor will persuade you into what they think should happen or their beliefs. They don't always look at it as your way of thinking just what they've been taught and learned. They also aren't alway as compassionate about and undertanding about the way you feel they do things every day and some doctors loose their passion for their work and it becomes just a pay check.
1	My doctor is ethical is her behavior. I have witnessed her bedside manner and he skills in action. Her patients and colleagues admire her. 
-1	most doctors like to load their patients up on lots of medications. for example, when i was 17 i went to my doctor with stomach pain. it turns out i have acid reflux, my doctor gave me medication for it instead of giving me a list of foods to avoid.
-1	My doctor most of the time so thins in my favor she make sure I do ever text she ask me to do and do follow up on my med
1	Because she always goes out of her way just o male sure things get done safetly and effectively. I've been with her for years and don't plan to change to someone else 
1	i trust my primary care physician because they are very competent and i am pleased with them. very good prescriptions and affordable health care for me and my family. 
-1	My doctor seems very stern and I am uncertain whether she truly knows what is best for my body. For instance, she strongly recommended that I take birth control. However, I am not open to the effects that it will have on my body and at this point and time in my relationship, a child would not be such a bad thing. She did not care for my feelings and was only concerned about the medical aspect of the situation. 
1	I trust my doctor because of his track record and because of my own research into my condition. When  we meet, he seems to genuinely care about me and my conditions, and does not judge me. 
-1	Doctors are there to help figure out what is wrong with you with the information you give them the more correct information they have the better the results. Most of the time they just give the brugs that is design to help the problem that you have 
-1	He's a very caring and professional man, but I'm not sure if he chooses the right treatments for me. 
1	My doctor is very thorough and he goes over my chart with me.He also ask about how things are going with other Dr he have recommended me to see
-1	Some doctors these days do not listen to what their patients are telling them. They are to much in a hurry to get to the next patient.
1	I trust my doctor because she is very knowledgeable. She has diagnosed issues that others were not able to pick up on. 
-1	I don't completely distrust the doctor's word. I just believe that things can change for the better quite often through prayer and fasting; believing in God
-1	The medical field as a whole is unreliable and the drug industry is completely untrustworthy which makes the doc harder to trust because drug reps coerce them into pushing their drugs even tho another drug would be much bettet
-1	Have many years of experience. Have been in the community for decades. Will take the time to listen to my questions and concerns
1	My doctor takes her time during my appointment to answer all of my questions and concerns. She seems concerned about my health concerns as well.
-1	I want to say that I completely agree with my doctor but some of the things that he says I find it to be true
1	I am between doctors right now, but my last doctor was very patient, knowledgeable and concerned about any problems or conditions I brought to him.  He would  asked question about my symptoms and suggest remedies for me to consider.  
-1	At times, their mane concern is to make money through my insurance or even through me. I would rather look up my illness and take care of it in my only unless it is really savvier, then I would go in and have the doctor take a look. 
-1	I trust my physician because they have all the resources to handle my situations but they are not perfect so I do not completely depend on them to be honest and correct about everything.
-1	I trust my primary care physician. She is trustworthy and knows what she is doing most of the time of my visits
-1	my doctor only cares about stupid things and not actual issues. I do not get the help that I need. they only throw drugs at the problems and send me on my way
-1	I trust my physician because he seems knowledgeable about health care. Not only that he seems to generally care about his patients. He never rushes through my appointments and answer any question I may have.
-1	I do not have a primary doctor but when i receive treatment i do trust what the doctors and nurses tell me because they have more knowledge about what is wrong with me
-1	I JUST SAID NEUTRAL THAT DOESN'T MEAN  NOTHING.I DO TRUST MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. I DO HAVE A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR
1	He is super good the best  I had he give all kind of tests  ask a million questions  my other Drs.  just gave gave out prescriptions.
-1	My physician takes time to talk, answer questions and make suggestions. He makes sure that I understand what is best for me and does not make me feel rushed and that he does not have time to discuss or hear my concerns.
-1	I asked my physician about certain medications and she said that she doesn't like to prescribe those drugs. I respect her respect her reasoning, as I feel the same way about certain medications
-1	I feel that my provider has my best interest in my physical well being and takes the time to answer any questions I may have.
1	I have had the same primary care physician for seven years.  We have mutual respect and trust in each other.  My primary care physician is very credible, highly credentialed, and always professional.
1	My doctor has been with me throughout three pregnancies. I was sooo sick that I was hospitalized each time.  She was always upfront with me. She and all the doctors in the practice had excellent bedside manners.
-1	I trust no one, so therefore I  will ask alot of questions.  I think everyone should get a second opinion; or ask questions until you get all questions answered .
-1	I trust him because he takes time to explain things and doesn't rush me out of his office and comes across as sincere and even ends visit with a prayer for you
1	My doctor has always been proactive in my care and scheduled any tests that I may need. I would recommend my doctor to all my friends and family 
-1	She doesn't act like she is too concerned about my problems. She speaks over top of me. She doesn't do proper testing or know about the specific diagnosis, so smuts hard for her to recommend me to the proper specialist.
-1	I feel that today's doctors are trained to see people as numbers rather than people so it is hard to trust whether or not they really care
-1	I trust my doctor because I've been with her a few years, and she helps me with everything, all my health needs. She's very thorough and asks me questions to really understand my concerns. I do feel like all doctors push medications and sometimes I feel like some of the medications I'm supposed to take can make situations worst or the misunderstand my needs prior to providing me with a medication. 
-1	My doctor's seem to be laid back and more concerned with quantity than quality, coming up with treatment's before even fully diagnosing a situation
1	Unfortunately, time and time again, we have seen lots of dishonest practices from physicians. This is why I cannot trust the a 100 percent.
-1	I may not have the best relationship with my kids primary care doctor, but I do trust her. She is a very straight forward knowledgeable person that has practiced medicine for for 30 years.
1	He's always been honest and have had precise diagnosis on my health conditions.. He's also very careful knowing how to handle injurys.
-1	He or she doesnt listen to me. They tell me what they believe to be wrong or right with me. I believe they just want peopls money and that they arent looking out for our best interest. I do trust some doctors but most of them I dont.
-1	I currently do not have a primary care physician and have not seen one in over 20 years.  I can not afford medical insurance for myself at the moment.
-1	theres no way you can trust or distrust your primary care physician unless there was an appropriate plays going on
1	They have been my doctos for awhile I believe it was when they tell me things. They haven't steered me wrong thus far.
-1	I trust doctors to a certain extent because each individual case is different and the patients needs have to match with the doctor's orders.
-1	 i trust my primary care physician because she takes my concerns seriously and runs through tests and exhaust all possibilities
1	No exact reason why. Doctors have saved me multiple times before in the past and also will be in the future.
-1	You can never trust a doctor all the way good or bad. Some times they out for money sometimes they want the best for you. 
-1	Doctors are people too. they are practicing medicine, so they don't have all the answers to medical problems. I don't completely trust anyone. 
1	My doctor takes the time to explain my over all health and where it should be. My doctor also takes the time to listen to my concerns and explains all my options as well as the risk of those options
-1	I recently switched from my pediatrician to a regular doctor and the general exam was less thorough. I felt that I could say anything and he didn't seem to care.
-1	Sometimes I feel that my physical don't listen to what I am telling her. She focus more on not giving out to much medication to her patients. I understand that she have to be careful, but it leaves me in pain and still sick.
-1	I have had my doctor for a number of years and will go to great lengths to make sure I get the care I need and answers all my questions no matter how they may seem

1	I trust my primary care physician because the last time I had a medical question to ask, I recognized his answers weren't just answers that benefitted either himself or someone he had close ties to. He informed me of options he that he personally told me he didn't agree with but made sure to say to me he understood my decision is not his yet he wanted me to understand the full picture. He didn't have to do that but he did and with a situation like that made me trust he had my best interest at heart.
-1	I think my doctor is knowledgeable however I sometimes feel rushed during appointments.  My doctor answers my questions but I feel like he doesn't want to take the time to thoroughly answer everything.
-1	I have trust in my primary care physician, he be good on alot of care. He be totally honest about all different treatment options in my condition.
-1	They always mix things up in the go so doctor report and most of the time they are wrong and if I go somewhere else they tell me something different

-1	Don't have primary care physician but don't completely trust doctors because if patients get well doctors out of business.  Also push too many pills.
-1	I trust my OBGYN caregiver because she is always honest and answers any of my questions with not only her professional opinion but based on her experience 
1	i trust my physician because that is their job to tell the truth and help you as needed. a doctor should always provide the help you need and should have a solution to your problem.
1	i trust them to do whats right for me and to give me good advice.  its their job to take care of me and  trust them to do so
-1	I feel that doctors do their job to the best of their ability but at the end of the day ethnic race and money is their main concern. If you have a condition that could be highly expensive and you have Medicaid like me then I doubt that they will tell you anything until it's too late.
1	She takes the time to listen to my concerns and ideas and plan for my health, as well as providing valuable information to assist me in doing so.
1	I trust my doctor because she has a calm cool confident professional manner. Asks questions that are appropriate to my condition.  And always answers my questions truthfully.

1	I trust my doctor because when he is with me he is force on me, he listen to what I am saying and take action about what I am saying. 
-1	I know next to nothing in the medical field and I see no reason why my doctor would not be interested in me regaining my full health. Hence, I see not reason not to trust them. My trust is not complete because they are still humans and can still make mistakes.
-1	Presently, I don't have health insurance  but it depends on my health needs. Or if, success has been accomplished after first visit. It depends what type doctor, too. I have issues & experienced certain problems related to my health for being neutral. Those experiences effect how I think, & causes some doubt about whether I am getting proper care. I know, I am responsible for my well-being, my understanding about why my body malfunction but need the assistance of others when in need. If, a medication is producing ill effects or too much is given. When, I am in control, I stop immediately & I don't take. Once the wrong thing has been administered it maybe to late. We all have our needs, & we may have same things. But body function differently when taken, the understanding.
-1	I used to hae a primary doctor that I completely trusted. Now, he is retired,so I do not trust doctors so much!
-1	I do not trust one of my physicians because even though I feel pain I always get the feeling that because they know nothing is broken I shouldn't be in pain or as much pain as I say I am. Also they give presriptions that either don't last long or just not work at all. I Do trust them because I am referred to them by my parent and some of my other physician are much more different. 
-1	i trust my doctor with the upmost respect as long as i provide him with details on what is going on with my body and he/she can elaborate on my health
1	I trust my Doctor's knowledge and his suggestions for my future health and what is best for me and my family.
1	He has not been wrong about anything yet. Therefore I will continue to trust him. If there was ever an instance where he was wrong then maybe we will start to have trust issues.
1	Whenever I have my yearly check up with my doctor I have trust in the outcome.  But if I were diagnosed with something I was not sure about I would get a second opinion.  I have a pretty good trust in doctors because before I go to a doctor I research him/her first so I know I have the best pretty much.
-1	My primary physician, sometimes I trust and distrust her at times. I don't really get what I need from her educationally when I'm there. 
-1	I don't trust a lot of doctors. Not all doctors in medical field are there for patient health, just money for lining their pockets. Not for well being of patients.

So I always trusted his judgment because I have pretty much known him my whole life.  I also trust my new doctor because he is a doctor and that is his job 
-1	I don't trust them because They only prescribe medication as treatment and only see you briefly. I trust them because they know more than me and they are supposed to be concerned about my health 
-1	I feel like all doctors are there first for the income and second for the health of the people. It's kind of hard to tell whether or not a doctor really cares about your well being or they just tell you anything to get you out of the way.
1	i trust mine because she knows her stuff and she has progressed my health much more than before. she has the knowledge to tell me truthfully whats right  from whats wrong
-1	I have trust to a certain extent, in doctors generally...never been misdiagnosed or anything. I have sought out second opinions. Most doctors encouraged you do do so, if they are trustworthy.
-1	I trust my primary care physician or regard to doctors in general because they are doctors and suppose to be trusted they hold information that is very private and personal to us and have to be trusted because of such. She's also kind. 
-1	I generally trust doctors to offer their best insights based on their knowledge and experience, which far surpasses mine as it relates to general health concerns.

However, I'm also assertive enough to make my own thoughts and questions known so that together, hopefully, we determine the best plan for my personal health. 
1	I trust my doctor because he knows all the right meds I should be on and what I should do and not do . He always answers all my questions I have and makes sure I am always okay .

-1	Some doctors are good and some are not so good. They are just in it for the money. I really wish there were better doctors. 
-1	In general all human beings (including physicians) share a margin of error potential.  Therefore, I do not blindly place explicit trust in any person.  It is important for all consumers who are able to act as their own advocate to assume this responsibility. Second opinions and thorough research should be considerations used to influence these personal decisions.
1	I have had the same doctor since i was little. My kids go to the same doctor. I trust the Urgent care centers in case of emergency
-1	Has a personal caring disposition with me at That is very important to me and my health has a knowledge of getting me to where I am health wise

I now have immune system problems and lymphodemia.  He gave me 5 years to live.  Before this the Dr was always right.  I approach Dr's like I do Medicine, with caution.  Only if I really, really need it.  
-1	With all the schooling and expenses doctors have to pay in medical school I would hope they enjoy what they are doing. I trust my doctor because that is their profession and I feel comfortable with their decisions

-1	I mostly trust my PCP. The only bad thing is I feel rushed. Which also makes me feel like she doesn't care. But she does try to find me help through other doctors or whatever is wrong with me. She does ask me questions that I don't even think to ask her. She seems to want to cure me quickly .
-1	I have not been given any reason not to trust my physician. She is willing to hear my concerns and prescribe necessary medication based on her assessment of what is wrong.
-1	I think that with any doctor I will have some distrust from their patients, because its a money making business. I think that how much income a doctor generates definitely has an impact on the amount care that the doctor provides. I personally often have these distrusting feelings but I also have no problem asking questions for clarification.  I will object to something that I disagree with and I will go else where for treatment.
-1	It the medicine that I have to take it is a simulated and because of that I have to suffer they don't believe another me to see strength doses I have came to her two time try get her to gave me the help needed seemed to me that I am faced impossible odd

-1	I an neutral to most doctors because they are in it for the money. The more medications they proscribed the more money in their pockets 
1	My doctor seems very trustworthy and every time I go to her she gives me great advice and seems as if she cares. I go mainly for womanly checks and she does a great job making sure I'm comfortable.
-1	I trust my doctor him to a certain extent because they have the knowledge and understanding what's going on. It's always best to get a second opinion because you don't know exactly what's right and wrong.
-1	I trust my doctor but through past experience I know that doctors sometimes make bad decisions that can end up in devastating circumstances. They often have support so should not make snap decisions without consenting other doctors and nurses.
1	I trust my primary care physician because when ever I had concerns about the medication i was taking they've always listened to me and made changes in the medication that was effective and had less side effects.
1	I went through a few doctors before my current doctor. So I have a lot of confidence in both my doctors, I have to see a neurologist and my primary doctor.  The first neurologist actually admitted to me that she didn't know much about my condition so therefore I had no confidence in her at all.
-1	I trust my doctor to an extend, but I think it's always important to do research on conditions for yourself and God third party medical opinions as well.
-1	They are honest and helpful. In a human level they give you tips on what is right for you.i feel they break down the good and the bad of your health situation in a way that makes you think. Other times they try to hard or not enough to be on your side. You can tell if you trust or distrust by personality.

1	I trust my doctor because he knows what's best for me, more than I know what's best for myself. As a trained Juliard physician who has a better understanding & working knowledge of the human anatomy, along with eight years of attending the best schools on a person's overall physical, mental or emotional health, I can rest in knowing that I can put my trust, and ultimately my life, in the hands of one who's more highly qualified as what's best for my continuing to live a long and healthy life. 
1	The reason I trust my primary care physician is because I have complete confidence in him.  He's been my PCP for over 16 years.

1	I have an integrated health doctor. This one has been the best fitted for me. She listens to my concerns and we try alternative options before going straight to prescription meds. 
-1	I rarely go to the doctor, so it is hard to answer this question. I mean what else am I suppose to say in this

-1	Im not soley untrustworthy of doctors however mesicine in my opinion has stiffled the body from self healing medicinal alternatives also doctors are worry about money more than patient and thats a concern of mines
-1	My doctor is very caring, and makes me feel confident about treatments he suggests.  When you go in you feel more like a family member than a patient.  He doesn't rush he is thorough and he can't get answers he'll refer you somewhere that can
1	I don't distrust my primary care physician, but I'm cautious in general and if there's room for a second opinion I will always consider getting one.

-1	I think some physicians knows what they doing while some makes some mistakes...but all in all they are ok
1	I dont my parents have been here  but I see that I lose once I walk out the dooor to something else orthers will take how they feel about health care and use it for the self and not orthers people are a custom to hear they ant shit and it just builts problem more and more for that person to have mental break downs but it has move from mental to physical as well and it is excepted that the y get off the hook and not say on the hook .

-1	The reasons I trust my doctor is that they always answer my questions thoughtfully and in detail that I can comprehend easily.
-1	Times have changed, time being the operative word. These days ,the administrative factors influencing medical care are abounding. Time is money and the less time spent with a patient, the more patients a doctor can see , thus, the care suffers.
-1	My main issue is how doctors are educated and their over reliance on pharmaceutical drugs. In my experience it is the rare doctor who takes the time to actually diagnose a problem rather than putting a 'band aid' on itin the form of some prescribed drugs.
1	Their job Is to keep you alive if they fail that then that's a loss of life on their hands. Their completly trained for eight years to be doing what their doing
-1	He is willing to listen to me about my illness and help the problem by giving necessary medicine. When ask questions by writing it down he make sure he looks at it. And I ask him what vaccines do I need base on my age. And he make sure it get done the same day.

1	I trust in there ability to give the correct information because doctors are right on the spot with listening to you an getting you the things you need to make you feel better 
-1	I do not have a strong amount of trust in any doctor. Doctors often lie or leave out information pertaining to medical information, in order to make their money. For example, doctors are aware of how dangerous kemo and radiation are, but they continue to sale it to patients. 
-1	I have have known her for many years! She is very good at her job and care about me as her patient. She as a physician has been practicing for quite some time.

-1	Typically my doctor seems to always want to do things that cost but i have no money. I feel was though she always wants me to visit but never helps me with my problem
-1	I have never had major health problem. My doctor has done well in yearly physical exams and I think she will be good if I have a major health issue

1	I usually trust my doctor since she is a health care expert.  However, if I need surgery, which is very serious I always try to get a second opinion.  Also, if I am diagnosed with something I always get a second opinion.
1	Now he take care of me talk too me and tell me what I need too know About my health it is a good thing my doctor is great give me the things I need too know.
1	I have been going to the same pediatric physician since I was 3 years old and have continued since the past 17 years. Since I have been with this doctor all of my personal health risk and issues have been taken care of accordingly.
-1	Some Doctors care about their patients and other Doctors care about their wallet. There are so many sick patients out here that needs help but their not getting it.
-1	I want to trust doctors as their job is so important and I would like to believe that they know that and always want to do the best thing but not all people do the right things and people get into some industries for all the wrong reasons. 
1	She makes me feel completely comfortable and she listens. She explains everything to me and answers any and all questions I may have.
-1	I've known my doctor since I was little I trust him completely in every discussion we have and every decision he makes I even trust the nurses

-1	I trust my primary care due to the years of experience, references and relationship that is trusted and have been known to deliver sound results and recommendations
-1	On more than one occasion, just to be sure, I have sought second options and been told different than the what my doctor has said. Sometimes something as simple as a google search and bringing new questions to the doctor based on said google search has changed my doctors opinion or suggestions for treatment. 
1	My doctor is confident and knowledgeable. He listens intently and compassionately. Doesn't prescribe a lot of unnecessary testing. Has been right on the mark with his diagnoses so far. 
-1	Been with my doctor for years. she is very thorough does not rush me off. i found out more about my well being by her patients & understanding. 
-1	Primary physician seems balanced in giving medical care and treatment. Not too emotional. Intelligent. Bilingual or more. Stands her ground.
-1	Cause he  try to get me out of the office fast and always say exercise to every problem I have and that's not what's going to solve my issues 
-1	I believe that they can be trusted for the most part. I do believe they may prescribe certain medicines to get a kickback but I dont believe they would completely lie about a condition.
-1	I don't have full trust in my PCP due to an incident with my husband.  6 weeks after his office visit they notify him that he needs to have an ultrasound on his kidneys because his cortizone levels were high and they thought his kidneys were failing.....6 WEEKS LATER THEY NOTIFY HIM THEY FEEL HIS KIDNEYS ARE FAILING.  Then 3 months later the office contacts him about whether he had this other test done (can't recall the specific test) of which he informed him that NO ONE made him aware he needed this done.  3 months they wait to see if he had it done!!!  I call it negligent or they have to many patients and can't keep up with their responsibilities.
-1	I trust my doctor because she wants to help me and she cares about me.  She also takes the time to listen to me and does not rush my visit.
1	My doctor has several years of experience and has always been forthright and open with me when it comes to routine appointments as well as necessary test. I have had different doctors in the past who were not that way.
-1	I do not have a primary care physician.  I usually do not trust them.  Not really into doctors. Doctors will lie
1	I trust my Primary Care Physician because she actually knows her job. She treats her patients as if they are her own family. She can look at me and know what questions to ask.
-1	I trust my physician because they are a medical authority and have dedicated their life work to understanding medicine.
1	I trust my primary care physician because he knows more about medicine than I do and he has done all his research and will know what's best for me through my symptoms.

1	I have been going to her for many years.  I have been through several medication conditions within those years and she has alway been thorough, patient and understanding and making sure I got the best possible treatment.  
-1	It depends on the doctor you have. You need to get to know your doctors personality and character so you can determine your level of trust. I feel my new doctor is thorough and attentive to my needs. I have a high level of trust in his ability and concern.
1	My primary doctor always takes the necessary time to explain the test results and ohysical examination so that I fully understand the visit.
-1	he is older and not up to date on a lot of the newer advances in medicine and I feel he prescribes stuff to get the perks

1	My doctor actually seems to care what happens to me and how my treatments are going and affecting me
1	I've been going to the same doctor about 15 years now - if I don't trust her I wouldn't Be going to her.  She's  very understandable when it comes to my needs and knows what best for me.
-1	With the on going battle over the cost of health care, doctors are more frequently making decisions that benefit them rather than the patient now a days.
-1	I don't trust any human to take care of me.  We all make mistakes and I refuse for their mistakes to be made on me.  The most a doctor can do is tell me what they believe is wrong but it's up to me to fix it.
1	I have not had any sort of medical situation that would require me to analyze the extent to which I trust my physicians so right now I really have no reason not to.
1	I am able to ask any questions and have those questions thoroughly answered.  Explanations are given as the examination is being conducted.
-1	I just established a primary care physician not to long ago so I am still gaining that trust. So far it seems like she is trustworthy and really wants the best for me. I have heard good things about her which is why I decided to establish her as my pcp 
-1	the personal treatment they give me gives me a sense of how the physician cares about my health. As though they are more knowledgeable about me than i am. I'm a little distrustful of residents who have not had a lot of experience  because i get the feeling they're just guessing or they're not to confidant of there diagnosis

1	I believe there is a monetary factor connection to some of the health care decisions on the part of the provider.
-1	I trust my primary physician because they went to school to become a physician so I know they pretty much know what they talking about and have my best interest.  I wouldn't trust them if every time something happens and I ask questions and nothing works out 
1	I've been with the same doctors for over 25yrs I definitely trust them, if there's a situation that needs to be address I am confident that my doctors will inform me and give the guidance to take the appropriate action to address the issue.

1	I trust them all no matter what the situation, sometimes I do get other opinion on something just to make sure.
-1	He doesn't take time to listen to what is I am saying. He comes into the room, checks your breathing, look into your ears (only if asked) and then proceeds to write prescriptions 
-1	I don't think doctors know what they think they know. I have multiple disabilities, and at least one is an orphan - no known good treatments.  The ones for the standard form don't work well if at all.  And the ones they won't give me are the only things that ever did any good!

1	I have used this doctor for many years and he has always guided me correctly and medical directions I need.
-1	I see more specialists than I see my primary. The specialists are very conservative in treatment planning and sometimes I have to present my own research to get treatment moving along

-1	My primary doctor is a smart, honest and caring person , I trust him taking care of me in my time of need, he explains everything in detail and breaks it down so you can understand what you need to know and then he asks if you have any questions and if you do he will kindly answer them and tell you what you need to know 
-1	I generally trust my physicians, but I'm not afraid to ask questions or challenge their proposed approach if I'm aware of something they may not have considered. If my treatment isn't working, I'll do some research on my own and come back with questions the next time.
1	i don't know yet. Not so sure what to do but, I'll keep trying the best I can. Maybe things will get better sooner or later.

-1	i've been seeing him for a very long time and he has never let me down or given me bad medical advice. i trust him one hundred percent.
1	Having had the same doctor, nursing and staff for over ten years, has built trust in his decesions. Even after several years have poor health the overall satisfaction with medical care still exists, even with costs and scripts rising, staff have tried to provide all avenues od discounts that may help me

1	My doctor is always patient and thorough with me, even though most of my problems are mental and not physical and I have another doctor to handle the mental stuff. Even when she's running behind she spends the full time with me
-1	Experience with her treatment has given me confidence in her care. I can't say I have complete trust in anyone.
1	They could be lying at any point making up fake illnesses that I could possibly have.  This would be so they make more money off me

Idon't feel comfortable around her.  Iavoid her and go to a separate clinic or straight to the hospital if I need care- such as when I just broke my shoulder.
1	i have already explained this. my doctor and i have a good relationship. we talk, we discuss. she is open with me about where i am at in my care and listens well.
-1	I know what is wrong with me but I try to tell my Doctor and he thinks nothing is wrong.  All my X-rays,  CT tells a different story.

1	I trust my primary care physician because I have been her patient for years and years and she hadn't let me down and don't think she will regrading my health. 
-1	I trust my physician due to the fact of being a paitent of his nurse for a number of years in the past
-1	They are guided by big pharma and their paychecks. Why else would there be advertisements on TV about something a doctor should be prescribing?
1	First she is a woman, I trust female doctors over male. She listens and even argues with about taking care of myself.
-1	Because he is a very good physician and he has been honest and trust worthy in the past, so I have no reason not to trust him, and so far he has been right with the medical issues with me.
-1	At times I feel like just a number and a way to make them money. Other times I feel that they are truly co concerned for my well being and my health care. 
-1	I feel that, similar to lawyers, medical professionals will sometimes look to profit instead of wanting the best service for their customer. For example, a few years ago my dentist suggested braces, which would've been an extra 4,000 dollars. I refused, and my teeth are still perfectly healthy.
1	She listens to my concerns and gives options and realistic goals and expectations. She makes wonderful referrals and explains everything in great detail. 
-1	At this current time I do not have a primary doctor. The reason being is that there is nothing going on with me. As me trusting or distrusting a doctor that's neither here or there because I trust in a higher power 
1	it took me a while to find the right doctor, but after almost 3 year I think I have finally found a doctor that I can truly trust.
-1	It is not that I don't trust doctors , I'm a little wary. I do also ask many questions and I don't like to be rushed
-1	I trust doctors to the extent that I believe that they are knowledgeable about the specific issue being addressed. Not all doctors are well-informed, nor do they have expertise in all areas. 
-1	Because the doctor I have has been through the necessary schooling and experience so I trust his or her judgement
1	Doctors in general know what they are doing.  So I trust them in making decisions for me.  I like when a doctor shows empathy for me or any other patient.

1	My docotor is an amazing woman and she helps me all the time when I'm sick and also gives me advise to walk in her shoes 
-1	He doesn't always look into what is wrong with me.  He just assumes. I'll tell him what it wrong with me and he will say oh well it sounds like this and that but doesn't do any kid of tests at all. Thats not OK to hold someone's life in their hands

1	I trust my primary care physician because he us experienced.  He also takes the time to figure out what is wrong.   He is also available when I need him.
-1	CONSECUENT PORTFOLIO SOLUTION OF ESTIMATING SIMPLE CONTRARY OF THE INSPIRED PROSPECT SECURITY INPUT ACCOUNT RIGHT
-1	I feel that they don't totally tell me.everything honestly. They are more worried bout money and the pharmaceutical company.  
-1	I feel they just want to hurry me out of the office. And although I ask the questions they cliup through them without full explanation or simple yes and no as opposed to futher explanation.
-1	I don't have a primary doctor because the ones I went to weren't that great and I feel that they didn't understand me or didn't believe me and my condition and made me feel like I was lying
1	What ever she tells me always works. I have never had any problems trusting my Doctor and any of the other Doctors I have ever seen.
1	My primary care physician has always been great. She is very personable and honest. She reccomends nothing but the best for me. I am very thankful to have found a doctor like her
-1	They seem kind and I have never had any issues with them. They come highly recommended. I have be given accurate diagnostics, advice, and medication for any illness I have had. 
-1	I do care about my primary care physician because i have a close relationship with him and he knows me for years
-1	I don't trust ANY physician. They're in the pockets of big pharma and push possibly harmful or unnecessary drugs for personal gain. Money is their bottom line.
-1	My doctor is very trusting. She is transparent and completely open. I am able to ask her anything and she will give me the truth whether it's good or bad. I feel confident when I see her for treatment.

1	he always takes his time with me, gives me advice and then leaves it up to me.  Great be side matter.
-1	No primary care physician, but I feel that their Hippocratic oath binds them to being the best they can for their patients
1	he takes good care of me and if any thing is wrong with me he will sit and explain my options to me and we can decide what form of actions to take
-1	Sometimes when I'm sick, I go in and they give me one medication. My condition sometimes stays the same and sometimes gets worse, so I go back in and they give me a different medication. I understand that medicine practice can be experimental, but I hope that isn't regularly the case AND it should definitely not be the case when messing with things like antibiotics. 
1	I finally found a PCP who listens to me and knows I know more about my condition than he does. I will listen to his advice about other medical issues that I know little about 
1	I'd be dead without her. Always having my best of interest and making sure I'm fine, physically and mentally 
1	my personal physician has known me for 50 years and has never steered me wrong. He doesn't over medicate and I have total confidence that anything he suggests is worth listening to.
1	I believe that my doctor is actively listening to my concerns and is treating me as best as she can. I do trust her.
-1	I trust physicians because they understand my personal feelings and thoughts. It feels like having a true close friend when I have a physician who perfectly understands my problems and is patient with me.
-1	My doctor always makes sure to look over everything and run multiple tests if needed. He's very concerned about how you're feeling and finding an answer. On the other hand, one of the nurse practitioners likes things that are convenient for her and usually comes up with a diagnosis without further investigation. Overall I trust my doctor but not the other staff.
1	I've been to doctors in the past that didn't listen, didn't ask questions, didn't explain conditions or medications thoroughly, and always acted like they were in a rush and had something more important to do. My current doctor is the exact opposite of what I've described.
-1	Sometimes doctors omit information because I did not ask them directly about it. They also tend to rush the process of care and are bound by hospital rules which may prohibit preventitive procedures without compelling evidence. 
1	highly trained professional that knows their jobs.always put,s their patients first,and provide high quality care
1	Sometime they are busy and don't have time to do complete assessment of the patient have a lot to do sometimes they work long hours
1	He has never let me down after many years and has always gone to extreme length s to assure my treatment
1	My physician is a great doctor. He has done everything in his power to help me where others have failed or didn't want to.
-1	My doctor that I used to have, I don't currently have insurance so I haven't been to the doctors in a few years even though I have a condition that needs medical treatment I don't qualify for free health insurance and I can't afford health insurance, but my previous doctor seemed to just want to get me out of the office as soon as possible and not explain things or ask questions. I also don't feel like I was examined like I should have been. The doctor would just look at me and tell me what she thought it was without any examination. 
-1	I do not have complete trust in my doctor as they need to make money first, and care about people less than they should. They want to help others but also can't do the cheapest options.
1	I've been a patient of my doctor for some time and we have developed a very good doctor patient relationship. If I do not feel comfortable with something she informs me of then I question it and vice-versa.
1	i trust my doctor totally.......when he prescribes a new med or feels i need test done.......i discuss with good friends and they all agree with his treatment.
-1	I trust him, but he is a family practitioner so sometimes I don't think he always knows what is best when it comes to my mental health.

-1	I do and dont trust them but i know they mean best interest at heart for trearment and health conditions
-1	Sometime doctors just lok out for their own benefit rathan Try to take good care of their patience. Try to see as many patiences as possible
-1	My primary care doctor is a group of doctors on the base. And sometimes they switch which one will see me for whatever the appointment is for. 
-1	I have had many doctors over the years and sometimes they have totally lied to me and cost me my health.
-1	I've been using the same primary care physician for years, so there's a familiarity there. He understands my needs and the ways in which I prefer to address possible medical issues. 
-1	MY DOCTOR SEEMS TO BE PRO-ACTIVE ABOUT CONTACTING ME ABOUT ANY CONCERNS HE MAY HAVE WITH MY HEALTH OR ANY QUESTIONS THAT I MAY HAVE WITH ANY CONCERNS I HAVE.
-1	Overall I trust my doctor.  Sometimes when she is busy with many patients, I feel as though she rushes my checkup.

1	I have been knowing my primary care physician for years. Whenever I am having an issue or sick, it is handled immediately. My physician is always honest and up front with me. 
1	Doctors are there for you, regardless of the golfing and high salaries.  Because if they fail, there will be lawsuits - which will cost hospitals lots of money and reputation.
-1	I have a sense of security with my doctor. I trust them to do their best and provide me with the information I need to help me with a certain problem 
-1	i dont even understand that question either. i am tired of these people over here. they are out of control. i dont think they have any original thoughts in their head.
-1	In the past my pharmaceutical care has been top-notch in most of the issues that I've had I've been able to receive helpful and cheap help that while inexpensive was still effective to the point where I could get what I needed without having to lose half of my bank account. As well as the fact that when I'm in the care of my dr. I feel as if I can address issues that I have and concerns that I have while still being able to see honest feedback with proper support and help
-1	Because they are professionals at what they do. And they know that there main concern is to help their client out in the best way possible without doing anything negative to them.
-1	I do believe the dr gives you right diagnosis sometime Spme0 you need a second opinion they do miss the mark
-1	I would have to say that I somewhat trust my primary care physician. Its not that he isn't a nice guy its just that he doesn't really listen to what I might want or need. Its always him thinking he knows best because he is the doctor, but in all actuality I know my body better then he does. Sometimes I feel like he isn't telling me everything I need to know because he might not like what I have to say.
-1	I trust it because I'm treated well there so I trust what they're doing all the tine and know I don't need to switch over to a different physician 
-1	I believe in my doctors. And I love my doctors because I play football and they take care of my needs And you need to trust your family and doctors.
-1	I feel that my body usually works itself out in the long run so I am hesitant to most medicines prescribed to me
-1	He knows more about me medically than I know about myself. After all he is a doctor and has studied in fields that I have no knowledge of.
1	My doctor always has time to listen  to what's going on with my health ..between the two of us, she comes up with favorable conclusions
-1	I trust my doctor. But I believe that test need to be ran and blood work. My doctor can't always go with the simple answer. Sometimes a little more research needs to be done. Need to make sure I am healthily instead of always worrying about if my insurance will pay.

1	I trust my doctor because he gives strong thought to my well being in we join together to decide what is best for me
-1	I feel like the doctor doesn't know exactly what she's talking about sometimes. I feel like she just gives me medication instead of really getting into what is really going on. Some of the things she says is wrong. 
-1	I neither fully trust nor fully distrust doctors and other medical professional. I know that there are some good ones out there but I also know not all of them have the patients best interest in mind.
-1	Because my doctor had me on a mental medication that she neglected to tell me would cause me to have memory problems
1	Back home the Family Doctor took very good care of my parents. So, I trust him for he has done a good job on me.
-1	My Dr has been in my life for years and is always there when I need her. She is kind and like a second mother figure I am depressed and I could go to her office without an appointment and she will pull me in her office and be a listening ear
-1	I generally like his recommendations and what he says seems reasonable most of the time. He diesn't appear to want to give me a lot of medications. he speaks of getting off the medication as a possibility.

1	I always trust my healthcare provider , and I choose wisely.I would not go to someone I don't trust.
-1	I have a hard time trusting doctors because they are always busy. If you do not have a serious medical condition they will not take their time with you because they have more important things to do. For that reason, I do not always believe that a doctor is doing all they can for me.
1	My primary care physician is a nice and honest person. He has helped me through so much. He has never taken advantage of me, nor gave me any wrong medicine.
-1	My doctor is a internist and cardiologist; and he spends little time with patients.  He quickly prescribes drugs; and claims diet and exercise won't help alleviate medical conditions.  He is abrupt and does not explain things thoroughly; and refuses to allow patients to see test results..  I don't trust him at all!
-1	Sometimes it depends on the time spent in the room with me. Or the reason I am there for the visit. They may try to make me take a medication when we have discussed before that it doesn't work it doesn't help. Orsuggesting other tests etc to have more intake, but u don't know. Each doctor is defiNitleu different.

She gives her medical advice specific to my needs.
