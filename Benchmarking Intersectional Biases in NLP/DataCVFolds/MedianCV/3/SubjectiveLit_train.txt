1	My body is crap - my mind is still 100%. Well...maybe 97%. I have no problems with this.

1	I have an extremely good ability to process this sort of information. I have advanced degrees and process more complication information routinely.
-1	I think I am above average in my understanding of medical terminology.  However when I do not understand something I have a hard time getting a hold of someone.  Also I forget to ask the questions I have until after I leave.
1	I feel like I do. I have learned through the years to be very direct with people in the medical profession. I frankly don't trust anyone but the doctors and the nurses, and they start out as suspect. Any civilian working for the hospital is to be treated with zero trust whatsoever.
-1	I feel that I'm a smart person.  My mind is sharp but at the same time doctors and nurses are sometimes so vague and trying to just wrap up the appointment so they can get their money that I just go along with it

1	I can the capacity to learn anything I need to learn, process, and understand. Whether I fully understand or not it's my right to make decisions on my body whether I want to take something or have a surgery or not but it wouldn't be for a lack of understanding what's going on. 
-1	I have some ability to gain access to the basic health information I need, however most doctors make things vague or do not know enough about my own health to advise me.

-1	I feel like I can obtain and understand basic health information to make important decisions because I am educated and have no problem handling forms. I don't mind asking questions if I don't know something because nobody knows everything so it is important to always ask questions for clarification. 
-1	Very well. If it's broken down in layman's terms I understand
-1	Yes, I do, however, I don't think Doctors care so much anymore. My grandfather was a radiologist. In those days everyone had a good Doctor and they could afford to see him. My grandfather says his father was a doctor in the depression. People paid him with chickens, eggs and milk. I think barter might be a better way to have a doctor. Now when you say you have no insurance or state insurance they won't even make an appointment to see you.
1	With my background in medical terminology, I have no problems.
-1	I feel like I know a lot about health sciences because of going to school for occupational therapy and understanding many of the basic medical terms and understanding the basic health needs we should possess.

1	I have great confidences that I can process health information. If anything is unclear I will simply ask about it to make sure its clear. 
-1	I feel I have a good amount of knowledge. Im not afraid to ask questions and often times I will ask too many questions. This allows me to make I understand. I have trusted doctors to turn to
-1	I would understand to an extent but may need help with the paperwork.  Or google a few medical terms to help me
-1	I feel that I have the ability to obtain it, but I have less of an ability to process and understand it. There have been many times when I've wondered what a medicine was supposed to be doing for me, or times when I struggled to fill out forms (about myself!). I think there should be guides for some of these things.
-1	I am confident in my ability to process and understand the information. I always ask questions when I'm not sure

1	I feel fully confident. I am young and proficient in English and paperwork matters. I also work in healthcare.
-1	No, I often have to visit several doctors and have several opinions paired with research of my own to make my own health decisions. In my experience, many doctors aren't as helpful as I'd like them to be.
1	I am well educated enough to understand almost all medical information and to process what information is provided to me. My main issue is making sure I advocate for myself in asking questions, especially if it's with a provider I don't know well.
-1	I think I can comprehend most of it. There are some big words I don't understand which I usually try to get help with. It it usually easy to understand when someone else explains it

So, it isn't a certainty that I can find a specialist who can provide me the ""right"" answers to my questions. I don't always ask enough follow-up questions, in my opinion, as I don't want to take up too much of the health provider's time."

1	I AM VERY WELL READ AND HAVE NO PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL OR LEGAL FORMS
-1	I always feel comfortable when speaking to a medical professiol because they have seen many cases of my case. Whether I have allergies or anxiety, I talk to my doctor and tell him every step of pain or exhaustion I feel. I leave no stone un turned as I want the doctor's trust and help. 
-1	Most of that stuff goes over my head. I don't even read it half the time. The United States health care system is designed to screw us over. Who cares if I miss the fine print? It's all the same to me. Nobody cares.
1	I am completely capable. I grew up with a chronic illness, so I learned to advocate for myself,and ask the right questions.

-1	I am confident that I can obtain and understand basic health information and services. I'm more than capable of seeking out information I need, the issue is moreso that I sometimes don't bother to ask.

-1	I feel that I am fully capable of getting and understanding the information.  I also know how to ask the right questions and to ask for help if need be

-1	I feel like I can understand basic health information. The only problem I would have is with technical terms related to the medical field. 
1	I feel very confident that I have to capacity to understand basic health information. It is my health, after all, and I refuse to not have any and all information regarding any medical situations.
-1	I am pretty compentant at understanding what a lot of the words mean, but sometimes it is hard to understand certain implications of different aspects of my health.  I think it is better when a doctor can beak it down into terms more relateable rather than heavily coded in medical and scientific jargon  
-1	I feel like I sometimes am able to obtain, process, and understand health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, but not all the time. For example, when it's busy at the pharmacy, the pharmacist isn't always available to answer my questions about prescriptions. And when I visit the doctor for an acute problem, I can rarely get my chronic issue questions answered without having to schedule another visit.
1	I feel fine with it.  100% capable of doing what it takes to mage my healthcare- both asking and receiving all medical information. 
-1	I believe that I am able to moderately understand the things presented to me
-1	I believe I understand enough that with the help of my doctor, I could make a choice. I don't think I could do it on my own, but also don't think I'd have nothing of value to add to the conversation.
-1	I can always understand basic health information but I have a problem processing it while I am with the doctor or nurse.  It takes me a little time to think of the questions I want to ask and by then, I am already home and it is too late to call.  I feel like doctors and nurses can talk too fast and get you out of the office too quickly at times.
-1	I do feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic health information.  There might be times when I feel uncomfortable asking follow up questions or forget or don't think to ask something when I am in the office with the nurse/doctor
1	I understand it for the most part. Sometimes I do not understand what certain words mean, but usually can find a definition online or ask someone who is in the medical profession. I feel like I have pretty good access due to my insurance.
-1	I feel that I have a basic understanding generally of what the doctor or nurse is telling me. Sometimes I misunderstand what they are saying, or take the information out of context and miss vital information. When I get confused I feel kind of stupid and rarely ask for clarification.
-1	I think if the problem is just basic health, I have no problems. I am old enough to have life experiences that make me understand the basics. It is anything above that level that creates problems.
-1	I feel I am knowledgeable enough to understand basic health information, but when large terms start being used I sometimes get confused. 
-1	I think I pretty much have a good handle on understanding things, as well as seeking out reliable sources for information. As an example, when I was diagnosed as being BRCA1+, the oncologist said to me something like she didn't think she could tell me anything I didn't already know.
-1	I have a good amount of ability to understand basic health information. I have relatives in the medical field that teaches me things occasiolly. I have also taken some courses in high school and college that gave me the basic terminology and understanding.
1	I am someone who is comfortable overall in handling my own health decisions as I have been studying healthcare and lifestyle for a long time.  I may not be a professiol but I can definitely handle myself in a conversation with more experienced healthcare professiols as I have a well above average grasp on human health.
-1	There are plenty of ways thourgh the internet to get information or direct contact from the nurse or doctor while its asked. 
1	I speak American English as a tive. I have a college degree. Thus I am able to understand fairly complex and technical material.
1	I know exactly what a medical professiol is asking me. I'm fully capable of understanding the English language.
-1	I think I have a pretty good understanding to understand basic health information about conditions that arise. That being said, I've luckily never had anything overly complicated come up with my health. 
-1	i do not feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make an appropriate health decision because it is impossible to see a doctor these days. Moreover, once you actually see a doctor, they charge you out the wazoo. So there's this incentive not to go see a doctor. If i can't see a doctor, because i can't afford it. Then it's impossible to obtain/process/understand basic health information. Health care in the US is so broken. And trump is making it worse.
-1	It all depends on the circumstances. Some things are just harder than others to understand. I don't like doctors to begin with, they seem to cause a denial for me if something is wrong.
1	I think I have an average degree of capacity in these areas.  I understand all forms and am able to fill them out.  I do hesitate to ask some questions of the doctor at times but I am able to look up information online instead.
1	I know the basics. So I think I can make good decisions. Or if I don't understand something, I can ask and learn to help me make a better decision.
1	I am fully capable of taking care of my health needs.  I only need assistance when I do not understand some of the medical terms or procedures we are discussing.   The only help I need then is for the doctor to explain in non-medical terms. 
1	My mother was a nurse, technical medical terms were always used in our house and I used to study with my mother. I have a good memory and like knowing about health areas. I have little difficulty understanding health decisions.
-1	I feel ok.  It is hard to access healthcare and it is so expensive.  He Internet has helped me a ton in deciding what to do when I need to make health decisions
1	I feel confident. I have an understanding of the condition and the medical staff is helpful.
-1	Pretty good. I have medical training, so I can understand a lot of terms and what diagnosises are in treatments, etc. It helps a lot when you know and understand what a doctor is talking about.
-1	I can easily see that I am able to obtain health information from my doctor. I would be able to process the information that I was given and if I'm not able to understand it all, then I can ask the doctor to explain it more simpler.
-1	75 percent.  Alot of medical things are just over my head in general so I need a bit of help to understand the specifics. 
-1	I definitely think I have the ability to understand basic health information and services. I have pretty high comprehension levels so I find new information pretty easy to understand. I am also a good listener and absorb information well. 
1	I feel strongly that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. And if need be, act on it in a timely matter.
1	I have a strong ability to obtain, process and understand health information. I carefully read all documents, including HIPAA requirements, medication dosing and side effects, and also researching any problems I may have on my own. I have a good vocabulary and reading level, and I am not afraid to ask my doctor or nurse if I have questions or ask for their recommendations.
1	I feel like i have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I have never been given information that I found difficult to understand.  I am also not afraid to ask questions and read more on my own if there is something that I need to know.
-1	I have the capacity for the most part but every now and again I find myself needing some assistance with not just filling out paperwork but even understanding pill bottles and other medicine.

My mother worked in health care for a long time, so she is a valuable source of information for me if I need some help better understanding things. My wife is also there to answer questions and process information, though she is similar to me in that it takes some time to process questions.

-1	I am just as smart as others. I understand just fine.

With that experience I am pretty knowledgeable about most medical information.

-1	When dealing with health information and services, it's unlikely for an individual to be familiar with all the medical terminology.

More than once, I've left a consultation, and in processing what I just heard I realize there's something that doesn't make sense or something I've simply forgotten because I'd just been given a lot of information to retain.

Even though I don't have access to healthcare services, I always felt like I had such an option when I did have access to enough information to make sound health-related decisions.

I'm a healthy individual and I'm certain that any issues that I might have are minor and easy to take care of.
-1	I feel pretty competent in all of those regards. I am going into the medical field so I understand a lot of the vocabulary already. I don't understand all the forms they have me fill out though.

-1	i feel very confident in knowing that i know how to obtain the knowledge that i need

-1	I feel like I have enough knowledge about basic health situations to understand what my doctor is telling me. If I look confused when my doctor tells me something they will often explain what I need to know. I do not feel like I would understand things that are more uncommon like serious diseases or complicated insurance limitations.
-1	I find the information often complex and I have to read it several times.  I utilize my doctors, family and the internet to help me understand this information. 
-1	"I am the type of person that likes to know all the details about any given situation.  So when I am told I ""have something""  always ask a lot of questions and can find answers when needed.  I run into issues when I am told I have the symptoms of something but may not have it.  I have trouble understanding some of this info and how it relates to me: re how can we make this a known situation vs. a maybe.  So I can make decisions quite well when the information I have is concrete but have more issue when doctors start trying to diagnose me using exclusion tactics."
1	I feel that I have complete capacity to do the things listed above because I understand a lot of medical terminology as I lived with a doctor for several years. 
1	I have no problems doing anything like that.
1	I feel that I know everything that I need to know basically about any medical conditions that may arise. If there is something that I do not know then I can always go to Google and find out more about it.

Also, I have had one of my children be briefly hospitalized.  I felt like a competent adult in these situations.  I am an educated person with a law degree so my reading comprehension is good.  
-1	I feel mostly confident in my ability to understand basic health information and all the decisions that go with it. My hesitancy so say I am 100% confident stems strictly from medical confusion I get from time to time. In the medical profession now there are so many differing opinions that anything more than one source (doctor) is involved, explations become a little jumbled in my mind because of their differing views. I think this sometimes inhibits my ability to make faster and firm decisions about my health.
1	I have total capacity and understanding of health related matters and services and need no one to help me with making decisions. I am a fully functioning and sane adult that can make decisions for myself.

1	I believe I can understand the majority of health information to make decisions. I have a degree in Nursing so medical terminology is not confusing to me.

1	I think with my background in exercise and fitness I know a lot of terms and what they mean so i am confident that I can understand basic health information

-1	I am somewhat confident in my abilities.  When I don't understand, I try to ask some questions.  If my questions remain unswered I will try to research online

1	i am pretty confident I have complete capacity to understand all of the above.

1	I consider myself to be an intelligent individual and I haven't had any trouble understanding any medical information I've been given. Things have been explained well enough for me to understand.
1	I feel I have a great ability to obtain, process, and understand these things. My mother was an RN (now head of a health department), my grandmother was a PA, and I've grown up around doctors all my life. That's probably a bit of a unique position. I would say that it's much more difficult for the average person. 
-1	I don't feel that I'm directly qualified. But I ask my doctor lots of questions and make sure that I understand correctly.
1	I feel I have full capacity to read basic health information because I am learned enough to understand it.
-1	I have had to seek out people to help me make informed medical decisions. A family friend who is a doctor as well as my brother in law who is a malpractice lawyer help me make these decisions. After consulting these people ad well as my assigned doctors and nurses make me feel confident in my decisions. 
-1	I feel confident enough to ask my nurse/dr. all the questions I need to understand. I'm also confident in my reading/comprehension skills to understand written information. I know where to find more information online if I need it.
1	I feel like I have a great deal of capacity towards understanding, obtaining, and processing health info. I'm fairly well educated, well read, and I have a great doctor who takes the time to actually listen and explain. Additiolly, I can always look on the internet for information (from official sources, of course).
-1	I feel that I am fully able to understand and process health information and services.  I make my own health decisions based on the information that I have obtained.  I use my doctor as a resource if I do not understand something.  I also ask for recommendations so that I am able to have a choice of what is going on with my health treatment.
-1	I think I have the capacity to understand medical information but much of it goes over my head and I would need to ask for help (after which I should retain that information)
1	i feel my capacity for that is pretty good, because i went to college and i know how to understand concepts. also, i know how to google things i don't know.
-1	I feel like I am able to gather most of the information I need to make health care decisions for myself. I often spend time on the internet to research reviews of doctors so I know I choose someone trustworthy, and this makes me trust their decisions for me. I also feel I have enough knowledge to ask basic questions of my doctors and nurses to understand anything I am questioning.
-1	I feel that I have a good support network through my insurance and doctors. I have access to my medical information via my insurance website and I am able to contact my health professiols easily through message. I find that this is the easiest method.

1	I feel like I have the complete capacity to obtain any information I need. I feel this way because anytime I have had questions or issues I have always gotten an answer to my satifaction 
-1	Medical publications are often hard to read and not meant for laymen to process.  I do try to ask questions when I do not understand, but often I do not know that I do not fully understand until I try to explain it to other people.
-1	I have ability to understand. Sometimes doctors make things seem complicated on purpose. I understand more easily by doing my own research. 
-1	Generally, I feel confident about my ability to obtain and process basic health info. It can be confusing when two different doctors say two different things or even say things in slightly different ways.  Everyone seems to have a different opinion and it can be difficult to ascertain what to follow.  I don't always understand why I am given the prescriptions I am given and if they are really necessary.  
-1	I think if the problems and information are simplified to a degree where it is easy enough to understand for someone who did not go to med school, I can understand pretty well all the information given to me. 
1	I don't have any real doubts about my ability to process basic health information. Obviously I'm not initially familiar with some of the terminology, etc, but the basic instructions are usually fine. The one area I'd say is a little confusing is hearing conflicting advice from different sources, but I guess that situation is present whenever you have professiols with differing opinions.
-1	I feel I could obtain basic health info and services pretty well except for my social anxiety that gets in the way. I am often too shy to call to make an appointment, when I'm in an appointment I often just want it over as fast as possible so I might not bring up all my concerns.
1	I feel like i always have all the information i need to understand my health situations and make good decisions regarding my health. 
-1	Because of my anxiety, sometimes its hard for me to further questions professiols to properly convey what's wrong or to get the full instructions that I need. Especially if they seem annoyed or like they're stuck up it increases this. 
-1	I think that I feel competent enough to ask questions, but sometimes I feel that I am wasting their time and I could go home and look online. However, if I did research prior to the doctor's visit, I would ask the doctor or nurse questions that I've had during my research.
1	My vision, hearing and reading are excellent, so I feel I have no issue in getting the information. Occasiolly I might be unsure of a particular word that a doctor has said if it is the me of a condition or medication. Sometimes I will ask them to repeat it, and sometimes, if I don't think it's important to know the exact me, I won't ask. I normally feel comfortable asking any questions of my doctor that need clarification. And if I think of other questions afterward, sometimes I will call the office, or try to research the information online.
-1	I'm often times too shy to ask for help or further explation. However, I also feel that doctors and nurses have a tendency to rush things. I can barely even get my questions in because they just breeze through the appointment like they don't really want to be there or they have other things to be doing. I understand that they are busy, but this gets really frustrating as I almost always leave the office feeling as if there is more I need/want to know.
1	I have a couple of doctors I see regularly and they usually explain things to me which I seem to understand. But sometimes after I leave and get home I question some of the information because it can be overwhelming. 
1	I believe I have this capacity to a high degree. I am a high level reader and can understand information that is directed toward me, whether through reading or listening. I am also willing to ask any questions that will address any issues I am not clear on. 
1	I have had a lot of experience with hospital/medical documents so other than medical terms, I feel confident in determining what those documents say. I occasiolly run some medical terminology past a friend who is trained in the medical field but rarely. 
-1	Oftentimes information concerning my health can get a bit complex, and I occasiolly need aid from a professiol health professiol to decipher certain things regarding the information.
-1	Because both my kids have had surgeries, one has food allergies and my consulting business often works with doctors, I am comfortable asking questions and feeling like I understand the whole picture by the time the office visit is over. I also worked in rehab facilities and was in charge of insurance several years ago, so official forms don't confuse me at all.
1	Fot the most part. I try to ask the right questions in the room but sometimes find myself having to do my own research online when I get home
-1	For the most part, however, sometimes I am not really sure of what they are trying to convey. I usually have my daughter with me so she can ask questions I am not thinking of.
-1	I know that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Sometimes I just need a little bit of help to understand medical terminology.
-1	I feel my understanding is average. I can understand some things but most need assistance from someone who understands more. I usually prefer an expert in the field to get my info.
1	I think I mostly understand what I read and am told but there is not always an effort to make things easily understandable. If there are a lot of technical terms I may have questions or need things explained to me. I want to make sure I'm understanding completely when it comes to my health.
1	I am reasobly informed about health issues I encounter from time to time. It makes easy for me to act on medical advice I get from my doctors. 
-1	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	Full capacity to understand most anything presented to me. 
-1	I feel like I have most of the information I need. I can usually find more specific information, or explations in layman's terms, regarding my health information online. If not, I can always ask my doctor, who is very helpful. If my doctor is not available, sometimes I'll call my sister, who is a nurse and can often explain things better to me.l
-1	I am somewhat in the middle. I think my problem is I don't know how to ask the right question and don't know how to process the information correctly. I think I should be more active in asking questions. Usually the visits are less than 10-20 minutes and I forget to ask every important question.
-1	I feel confident about my ability to ask and answer questions about my health as well as the health of my child. If i don't understand something, I usually ask for it to be explained again or a different way.
-1	I believe that I can understand the basic health information. Although, I do have to ask questions to clarify details. In my experience, medical professiols, such as nurses and doctors, talk over my head. I am more confident in asking questions about things I don't understand, as I get older.
-1	If I have the able to google terms I don't understand then I would have no problem. But if I don't I feel stressed  because doctors don't always want to help. 
-1	I feel that I have a basic ability to obtain and process basic health information. At times I need help reading about conditions or help explaining what medications that I am on. But when I have a question or need assistance I always find the help that I need from my family.
-1	I feel like I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. Unless, the doctor or nurse is rushing to get me out of the office, I usually ask questions whenever I don't know something. This way, I can always be sure that I can make the best decision for my health.
-1	I think I've very capable of understanding basic health information. I can read just fine, and have a good understanding of most medical terms, unless it's something very abstract and rare. I ask questions when I think it's needed, and understand the answers given just fine. Between my understanding of things and other explations given (if needed), I feel I make good health decisions for myself.
-1	The Internet is full of useful information. There are plenty of official medical sites to read through if I don't get all the information I need from a medical professiol. But, honestly, I haven't even had a cold or flu in the 14 years I've been a vegan, so I don't go to the doctor. I'm a very healthy person.
-1	While I do believe I can read all the information given to me by medical professiols, It is sometimes difficult to understand exactly what they mean. I also don't know if I'm asking the right questions or what to even ask when I am given new information. 
-1	I have a good capacity to do all that because I have done it in the past and plan on in the future.
-1	I understand basic heath information as I have had issues before and make sure I know and understand what I need to know.
-1	I am confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  When I have questions, I do not hesitate to ask the medical staff for clarification.
1	Its very easy. All you have to do is ask and they will answer. You can also go online and find anything that you need to know. Getting information is very easy.
-1	I feel I am pretty competent in obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services. I feel that if there is something I don't understand I make sure to ask for clarification from either my health professiol or family member.
1	Fortutely, I have a good understanding of medical terms and I'm not afraid to ask questions.  Many people are reluctant to question doctors but I'm not one of them. I feel that the patient has to be proactive and take responsibility for getting good medical care.  Doctors aren't mind readers and cannot help a patient if they don't provide all the necessary information.
1	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process and understand this information. It's easy to understand information about simple concerns -- like if I go to the doctor with an infection, and she diagnoses it and sends me home with a prescription for antibiotics, that's easy. No problem. But when I get into harder-to-diagnose issues (like the vertigo I've had for more than a decade), doctors tend to under-explain things and make a lot of assumptions that can make it hard to get useful information from them. My vertigo was never diagnosed by my then-doctor despite him running a bunch of tests I couldn't afford that all came back fine; I filly figured out the issue for myself (badly-adjusted new glasses that caused chronic eyestrain I still struggle with). Doctors also tend to brush off my concerns because I'm overweight, even when my concerns have nothing to do with my weight. Behavior like that from professiols can make it difficult and intimidating to make the right decisions for myself.
1	I feel I have the capacity to read, comprehend and understand not just basic but most or all health information I read. I'm fully capable of making appropriate health decisions concerning myself and also my family.

1	Having congestive heart failure has given me much knowledge on this disease. I have been in the hospital multiple times and see doctors quite frequently that I know understand this condition. I have a full understanding of what the disease is, does and what treatment options there are. of the treatment options I understand the ones my doctors use, why they use them.
-1	For the most part I think I'm pretty capable. If I don't understand something, I'm not afraid to ask. Also, I tend to search for help online quite a bit and often find my answers there. I have enough experience with doctors' appointments such that I think I am comfortable getting and processing information and figuring out how to get help if I need it.
1	I have no problem asking questions, and I have asked doctors to explain in layman's terms.  I also go online a lot to look up information.  I prefer it coming from the doctor though.  I also have a brother who is a doctor and a sister in law who is a nurse.  I have asked them questions before.
1	I can research terms or definitions online.  I am well educated and I am not intimidated by medical professiols.
-1	I feel like i do have the need to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Because I know the questions to ask when i need information and am not afraid to ask anything like if i dont understand to have them explain it again
1	"I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually feel comfortable asking questions when I am unsure of the answer, and whenever a doctor is explaining an issue, I am always thinking ""what's our next step,"" and will not leave until I get an answer to that question."
1	Although I am not a tive english speaker, I've been here since I was 5, so my English is pretty good. I watch a lot of medical documentaries and I am familiar with a lot of the equipment and procedures that some doctors go through, so I am very confident making medical decisions for the most part. If not, I can always go online and Google things. I am pretty tech savvy and know where to get my information from.
1	English is my tive language so I understand the forms I'm filling out and the conversations I'm having with my doctors.  I'm also relatively young, and do not have dimentia or other type of mental processing blocks.  
1	I have a high capacity. I choose my providers, to the extent possible, with communicativity as one of the criteria. I am highly intelligent and possess good alytical and communication skills, and am not afraid to research on my own and/or ask questions.
-1	Yes, I have basic comprehension of medical questions and can fill out my own forms and understand directions for medications, etc. Some medical terms are hard enough to pronounce, let alone know what they mean so I need clarification on that at times but am comfortable asking questions if I am unsure about anything.
1	I have pretty good health insurance through my company so I have access to any kind of doctor I need to see. I try to read as much as possible so I know what questions to ask. If I have questions, I also go to my mother. She used to work in the medical field, and she also has the same thyroid condition that I have. She has had it way longer then me, so she points me on the right direction.
-1	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand, obtain and process basic health information because I have a high understanding of the basic physiological systems in the human body. I have a degree in biochemistry and have a high understanding of the human body from a chemical standpoint.

-1	I am pretty confident in my ability to comprehend medical information when it comes to conditions and medications and things like that. However, if it involves hospital procedures or insurance or technical information like that, I need either assistance or to read up information from several sources in order to make sure I actually understand what I'm reading.
-1	I am fully capable of doing so. I have no cognitive deficits, I am very intelligent, capable, and confident.
1	I feel I have the ability and comprehension skill to understand medical terminology due to my education as a scientist and my tive comprehension of english. As such, I can comprehend the information well, and subsequently synthesize data from it and fill in the blanks with questions that are necessary to ask. Its a process in medical terms, but I feel I have the tive skill set to be very good at understanding information provided to me. 
1	I feel that I have no issues understanding health information and services. If I feel that the doctor is rushed or otherwise not totally available, I feel comfortable researching online to resolve any questions.
-1	I can understand most basic health information, I might have an issue once in a while not understanding some concept. I try to ask questions to doctors and nurses but most of the time I think of additiol questions when it is too late because I already left the doctor's office. 
-1	At the present time, when people need medical health they don't worry about understanding the information that is provided to them. They usually focus on getting healthier and resolving their matter.Each person should have a basic understanding of their health information and services that are provided to them in order to make their long term decision.

1	I have a decent general knowledge about health and medical terminology. I'm kind of science oriented anyway, and am very curious. I am confident in my ability to research terms and procedures and know which sites to trust and which to make sure to find corroborating information as there is a lot of bad info out there too.
1	I think I am able to obtain almost enough information needed. I can always call my doctor back and she will answer any questions I have or may have forgotten at the time. I feel like any information I may need I can get from someone or other sources.

I ask an enormous amount of questions from my health provider before I make any decisions to take medications or have a procedure performed.
-1	I've had some major, very rare medical problems in the very recent past that I had trouble with. Their rarity of the conditions hindered me, I think I can do the basic things health wise pretty easily though. 
1	I have no problems reading or understanding english so i can read and understand the materials im given just fine.

-1	Doctor offices scare me and it is like right before a big test. My mind goes blank. I cannot process what is going on. I would often have to ask the doctor or professiol to repeat what they are telling me. I look like a deer in headlights when I listen to them. It takes me hours afterwards to process what was said.

I would say to an average degree for someone my age I can obtain, process, and understand health information/ services.

After I get diagnosed, I might look up more information online, to further my knowledge.
-1	I feel like I can only understand the most basic results that my doctors can give me. Once they get into how much medication I need to take, what effects it will have in the long term the information just phases out of my head.

-1	As far as I know, I have my full mental capacities. I have a college degree and a masters degree and I've had to take care of family members with their healthcare, so I have a pretty good understanding of the system.
-1	I feel very qualified to do this as I was the caregiver for two termil parents and, due to the urgency and obvious passiote interest in their welfare, made a concerted effort to become highly involved in their medical care and procedures. Taking care of someone you love who is ill is like taking a crash course in medicine. And out of necessity, I developed the necessary courage and stami to talk to health care professiols irregardless of their taciturn or uncooperative tures.
1	I am an educated person that reads and has a high comprehension level.I do not believe that I have begun to experience Alzheimer's, yet.  When I do not understand a topic by my PCP and Cardiologist, I ask them to explain their thought processes to me, and they are always glad to share their knowledge with me.  
-1	I feel that it is very important to provide the dr with as much information as possible so the can effectively diagnos you issue correctlyrics.  I also think it is important to ask questions so I can understand what my issue may be
1	A very high degree. I'm a college graduate with a degree in jourlism. Not sure what else to say.
1	I am able to do all that stuff sufficiently.  I do have tremors in my right hand so at times I do ask for help writing stuff.  But all in all I have sufficient amount of help and understanding.

1	I feel like my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information is above average. I say that with full confidence because I have a B.S degree in Health Sciences.

-1	I feel I have a good understanding of health information and typically don't require assistance to understand

-1	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information. This, in turn, means I am able to understand basic health information. Because of this, I feel that I have the capacity to understand what I am told by doctors and what is written in medical forms.
-1	my mom is a nurse and i grew up with her talking about medical stuff and I was never able to have it all click in my mind.  I don't have the capacity to obtain, process and understand it.  Its like when people talk medical my brain shuts down.  I let my husband explain it to me...or my mom or my niece who is also a nurse
1	I think most of the time, I can handle the information. If I am very ill, or uncomfortable, that affects how much attention I can pay to new medical information.I have, in the past, had doctors repeat things as many times as I needed fr me to understand.
-1	I feel as though I have the capacity to obtain information, but the part where I may need help most is interpreting the information in a way that I understand it. A medical diagnosis is great, but unless my doctor can explain it to me in a way that I can understand, and also understand everything that accompanies it, then the diagnosis itself is useless to me. In my current health care system, if you speak to enough people, eventually you will be directed to the person who can help answer your question. 
1	I think I am fully able to do and take care of myself and my own needs
-1	For the most part, I think I can understand most of the information.  If I have any questions, I do ask my doctor or after I can call her or one of the nurses in the office. They will always help me.

-1	I think I have an adequate understanding of basic medical terminology to understand 90% of all trips to clinics or the hospital. However, if the terminology gets too technical, I need to get help either from a doctor or a friend help me explain what is going on. Overall, I think I have good capacity to make educated health decisions regarding my health. 
1	Yes I asked the necessary questions if there's anything I don't understand
1	"Most of the health information I have had to deal with has been very well explained to me, and I don't mind asking followup questions.  The doctor's are the experts after all.  One of my favorite quotes/phrases to use is ""Help me understand.""  When I am truly confused or stuck with something, that is what I go to, and I let the doctor know that they can break it down and treat it as if they are telling a five year old.  Most of it I understand, but don't mind letting them know I may have follow up questions."
-1	I feel like I'm literate and competent enough to understand things, but I often lack sufficient information because I have too little time face-to-face with a doctor, nurse, or tech.  I feel rushed along and don't feel like it's ok  to ask many questions or to provide very detailed information.
-1	It depends on the condition. For instance when I have a cold, medical care is easier to understand than when I am being seen for my thyroid.
1	I believe I can make appropriate health choices. I have worked in healthcare for the last four years, and I actually do administrative work where I review health information forms. I am confident that I understand what I am filling out on my persol health forms.

-1	I do feel that I can understand most of what is explained to me.  If not, I feel confident that I can find a doctor or nurse to explain what I don't understand.  I can also research issues myself on the internet.
1	I try to get a firm understanding of what's going on. I tell the doctor or nurse everything because I feel it's the one profession you should never lie to. I then listen to what they say and if I have a question I ask it. If I don't understand, I will try to have them explain it further or better. I then get other information on my condition and then I feel I am comfortable making a decision with the information I have received.
1	I fully understand what they tell me and I ask a lot of questions if it is unclear. I will also do significant research on the internet about any medical condition or procedure I may have.
1	I feel confident with obtaining and understanding health information. I have been a caregiver of someone with cancer as well, so I got quite a bit of practice doing so as asking questions was very important.

-1	I think i do ok with everything . But there are times i need help 
-1	Im open minded, and feel the need to question things, so I think I can usually dig as deep as i need to
-1	I can understand basic health information if I have the time to research it, but I often feel that they're rushed and would rather not go into it so I don't ask them. Only in rare cases where it's very important do I ask for clarification then and there.
1	I feel I have the ability process and understand basic health information and services by using the internet. Right now I have insurance so I can obtain information my provider has a free phone number to call to ask medical questions.
-1	I work at a hospital so I feel like I kind of get it, but when it comes to major issues I still feel confused when getting the information told to me. I don't think that it is due to stupidity as much as it is due to being confused on what to do. You feel trapped with one real choice and in many cases you want more options to choose from. 
-1	I feel like I can understand a lot of things and that I have gotten better at asking questions. However, I am bad at asking questions when they are about a new topic. For example, if I made an appointment to talk about issue A, but I also have issue B, I will only talk about issue A. I also do not understand health insurance information well.
1	I feel that my primary care physician goes above and beyond when it comes to me understanding what is going on, if I do have any questions. They take the time at the end of the visit just to address any questions or concerns I may have.
1	I have excellent knowledge of the healthcare field.  I am the person to go to when you need help understanding anything involving health.  I am not a Dr. or nurse. 
-1	To a good extent. Sometimes the questions on the forms are a bit confusing and it's hard to put down an answer.  They are also repetitive. I am able to ask the doctor questions about information given to me, but often questions do not come up until after the visit. 
1	I have no trouble obtaining and understanding health information, generally. The exception to that is if a doctor starts rattling off scientific medical terminology that I'm not familiar with, or if they reference drug mes I don't know. Reading material isn't an issue because I can always look something up if I don't understand it.
-1	I understand written and spoken English very well, but when I encounter a field-specific jargon I am not familiar with it can become difficult. I don't feel like being that tedious patient who wants every word defined like a verbal test from their college days. I do, however, ask for more information when I feel their explation is based on the assumption that I already know something. 
-1	I know enough to stay healthy by myself most of the time. But I sometimes take medicine. I feel like I'll have to think more about it when I am old.

1	I am confident in my capacity to effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.

-1	i think i am okay at it, but i do not always understand some of the big words.
1	I feel that the doctors who I go to are very informative and have provided me with both the pros and cons of the treatments they recommend. They usually also provide me with an adequate understanding of consequences that come with the treatment.
-1	I usually try to understand most of the basic things about my condition or diagnosis. I will ask some questions occasiolly. But sometimes if the doctor or nurse seems to be in a hurry, I won't ask everything that I really want to know and end up looking things up on the internet.
-1	First and foremost I have the internet to use when I have a health concern or question.  I will turn to the internet from the start since WebMD and other sites are a great resource to use for general information.  From there, if I visit the doctor I can ask the doctor or nurses questions.  I can also pick up literature in their offices for more information.  I have also been known to consult with friends and family members for advice and information on my health situations.
1	I have the ability to fill out, read ask questions and anything else I need to do by myself or with minimal help. I can usually understand what a dr is explaining to me and if I don't I ask more questions until I understand it.
1	Due to my employment in health care, I feel that I have a decent grasp of medical terminology and pathology. I usually understand what a doctor or nurse is explaining, and if I don't I feel very comfortable asking questions. However, I do also feel somewhat complacent when being treated and tend to trust what they are doing and not question their decisions.

If I don't understand, I will ask the doctor or nurse until I do, unless they seemed rushed. If they seemed rushed and unhelpful, I will not ask too many questions.

-1	I believe that although the system can be complicated, I am capable of making appropriate health decisions. I can ask for clarification and help with forms and acquire more information about topics and conditions being discussed.
-1	I think I understand written information much better than what a practitioner says to me. I miss SO much when I'm at a doctor's appointment - I forget what I'm told and forget what questions I wanted to ask, even when they're written down.
1	If I do have any questions about the information I make sure to ask until I do understand the material.  Otherwise I read over the material and look at it closely until I understand what it says if I did not the first time I read it over.

I'm not a doctor, so of course there are some things that require further explation, but I can usually quickly grasp the gist of the situation if the doctor uses layman's terms. I usually ask all the questions I can think of at the time when I'm in the appointment, but every once in a while I'll be too embarrassed to bring myself to ask about something.
-1	I'm pretty bright and understand a lot, but a lot of times my doctors or nurses don't really explain things to me in detail about my conditions, lab reports, etc. I also forget to ask questions or clarify things when I am there sometimes, because I tend to get nervous. They're always rushing too so it's not like you get a ton of time.

-1	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain and understand health information.

1	I understand everything. I could be a damn doctor if I wanted to go to medical school. I understand it all. 
-1	I feel I can obtain, process and understand my health information to a mostly satisfactory degree. There have been some instances in the past where I have had trouble understanding what a doctor tells me. In those cases I will ask nurses for clarification, and I also changed my doctor to get someone who communicated better to me. 
-1	I'm pretty confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand information. My largest issues would be that I am generally reluctant to go to the doctor unless I absolutely need to, and that I often don't ask too many questions especially when I'm afraid of the answer. I will generally accept instructions from doctor without asking for explations, which probably also limits my ability to make decisions well. To this point, none of this has ever had a negative effect on me.
-1	I feel I understand things written very well, and I am confident in understanding that, but I feel intimidated by medical professiols and sometimes I am hesitant to ask questions. 
1	I deal with doctors and forms so much over the last 2 years I'm getting to be a pro at it.. I also don't let doctors walk all over me and not hear my wishes. I live in opioid overdose central so I make sure I know what's going into my body and my doctor isn't just trying to make a new junkie.

-1	I am good at reading and comprehension. This means I am good at being able read these types of materials to make decisions.
-1	I feel like I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as well as services however I would always have a little bit of uncertainty simply because you don't want to make mistakes regarding your health or the health of your children. I definitely think for minor health issues I can comprehend everything quite well but as things get more serious I tend to be a little more doubtful of myself.
-1	I believe I am extremely capable of obtaining the information needed, and I am more than capable of understanding the information. Those concepts aren't beyond my reach, because I've always had an affinity for scientific studies, and that includes medical related fields. Making those decisions, however, is difficult for me, because decisions in general are difficult for me to make and motivation is even harder to come by.
-1	I feel that I am able to get adequate health information from doctors, nurses as well as through other resources.
1	The doctors I see always explain my condition and my options really well. Whenever I ask questions I feel like they go above and beyond on telling me everything they know to help me understand my illness or whatever I am seeing them for. I also have access to the internet; while not a reliable method for diagnosis, it does have extra information available about practically every illness and condition if I wish to learn more.
-1	I usually feel nervous at the doctors. I dont like not knowing information and i hate sounding dumb so I am nervous about asking further questions in an effort to avoid sounding dumb.

1	I think whenever i ask for any question or information regarding anything , my doctor gave me satisfactory answer. However i am not satisfied the way nurses handle the situation. whenever i call doctors office regarding my test results they never replied on time , and sometimes take more than 24 hours to return my call. 
-1	I feel like I do.  I just don't understand some of the terms the doctors/nurses use.  I understand most of what they are saying. It when you are at the doctor you're (at least I am) a little scared so your brain doesn't process like normal. 
1	I have great capacity.  I take care of an elderly person who acts helpless and pretends he can't do anything for himself in regards to his medical care, and I see how annoying this is to the doctors, so I make sure to really take a proactive stance in my own healthcare.

-1	I feel that I have a good degree of capacity to process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions.
-1	I feel like I have a good handle on it as long as I have very good explations from my doctor. I won't just let the doctor tell me what to do, I read up on options and come prepared. I have some knowledge of biological process, so I'm good in that way. The only thing that gets me is medical language--it's sometimes hard to understand. 
1	I am very clear when describing any symptoms. I am also very clear in my understanding of what the doctor tells me. i am also very clear in my understanding of what to ask the doctor. I am also very clear in my understanding that the doctors may also be incompetent.
-1	Sometimes they don't speak clearly enough to me where I can understand. They will tell me a lot of things I need to do, and most the time I forget. And it's hard to read their hand writing.
-1	I BELIEVE I GET ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED WHEN I AM AT THE DOCTOR OR AT THE PHARMACY.  I CAN ALWAYS LOOK UP MORE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET.  SOMETIMES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND MY DOCTOR WHETHER IT IS HER ENGLISH OR HER BIG WORDS THAT I DO NOT HAVE A DEGREE TO COMPREHEND.  
1	I'm fully capable of obtaining and understanding anything related to basic health information. If I have questions about something I will research it myself online before I talk to and question my doctor. I think this combition of internet and doctor makes it very easy to do.

There are occasions that I am not certain of some information and have to get back in tough with the doctors office to explain something to me.

-1	I feel that I had adequate capacity to process and understand basic health information for my needs. I've been fairly healthy so far, so the information isn't too complex.

1	I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.
-1	I think it's difficult to gauge. I mean they have things written out with complicated language that only doctors understand I mean there's a reason they have to go to college for like 8 years. Then when you have a doctor in front of you, you don't know exactly what to ask whether it's relevant or just a stupid question.

Furthermore I don't have any problems interacting with my doctors and nurses and pressing for more information.
1	I think I have the capacity. I really never had a hard time understanding what a doctor was telling me, and I've never had trouble filling out forms.

I usually research things on the internet before I even talk to a doctor of some kind to make sure I'll know terminology that may have something to do with my problem. 
1	I have the ability to understand basic health information and services needed. I have had to learn a lot about health care issues due to illness with my grandparents and losing my dad when he was 45.

I am an articulate person and understand the importance of voicing my concerns to health care professiols.

And for that reason, I believe that my capacity to relay that sort of information to my doctor is limited.

I've been to the doctor's a lot when I was younger so I know how things work, and when to ask questions about certain things if they don't explain things as clearly as I would like.

-1	I feel relatively able to a certain extent.  However, it's hard to say, because I don't know what I don't know.  But basic information, I should be able to understand it very well, I think. 
-1	I feel information is very available with the internet but not all information is correct. I always check with my doctor if I have questions. I have called the pharmacist a few times to ask questions.
1	I think I'm pretty capable to do what I need to to make health decisions. I generally ask questions when I don't understand something, unless it's just too far over my head and the answer would take too much time. Even then, I tend to google a lot. I like having information.
-1	For the most part, I feel I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I sometimes feel my doctor does not adequately understand my condition, as I am in a rural area with few options. This makes it difficult. 
-1	I feel sometimes i do not ask questions and wish I had. Normally I understand the information I am told by doctors and nurses.
-1	I've never felt that I lacked the information I needed to a great extent. I feel like whatever I learn from a doctor is a jumping off point. I trust doctors fully, but I also like to do my own research.
-1	In situations like medical conditions and issues, I say never too many questions. I do get discouraged at times when medical professiols make me feel I am being a bother, understandably they deal with so many patients, but as a patient feeling that I think they care and are listening makes a big difference.
-1	I think I'm capable of understanding most of the information but if I don't understand something I can always look up online.
-1	I feel as if I could use more help understanding basic health information and services. I don't know how to fill out certain health documents and having someone to help me id easier. There for I feel like I don't have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services so I'm not able to make an appropriate health decision for my self unless I have some help.
1	I feel confident in my ability to request and understand information about my health.  It is very important, so I would make sure I understand this information if I had questions.
1	I feel that I understand basic health information and services well enough to make informed and appropriate health decisions for myself. I don't have any trouble asking questions or standing up for myself and I can generally grasp abstract and complicated concepts.
-1	I feel comfortable understanding and making decision regarding health information. If there is something that is unclear I will ask for further information or a better explation. Also I will ask the opinions of my friends and family.
-1	I feel I have the ability to obtain and understand the information. What I would be worried about is retention. If I am given a lot of information, some of it may be verbal, I could easily forget or misunderstand the information. This could be detrimental in regards to my health. 
1	Regardless of my tendency to try to not make any waves I am an intelligent person and am able to grasp and understand things quickly.  Sometimes I do not think to ask questions while at the Doctors or I can not think of any questions to ask. But overall I feel that I am capable of getting and understanding any information I need to make informed health decisions.
-1	I believe that I am capable of doing so to a relatively high degree.   I have never had any complex medical problems, and have been lucky to have medical professiols that are great at explaining issues in an understandable and simplified way.  I sometimes worry that I am not being told enough about a condition, but then I reach out to resources on the internet to supplement my knowledge. 
1	I feel that I'm fully capable of doing that.  I understand the information health professiols give me and can do whatever research I feel necessary to make good heath care decisions.  I'm scientifically literate to a reasoble degree and have no reading or comprehension problems that would be a obstacle to that goal.
-1	I feel that I am very capable of processing the information needed to make the right health decisions. I am someone who is attentive to instructions and I do not shy away from asking questions when there is something that I don't understand. I also have a mother who has worked in the medical field who is able to provide me with assistance. I feel that I have all the tools at my disposal to make informed decisions when it comes to matters of health.
1	I think I have a pretty good grasp on medical jargon since my old brother is a doctor. If I ever need to ask any questions I can just reach out to him and he usually has an answer.
-1	I feel I have enough capacity to make the appropriate health decisions, as I am well educated with a background in biology and wellness.  It is not difficult to research or ask about anything I do not understand.
-1	I do a lot of research, so I am pretty confident in knowing and understanding what a doctor or nurse has to tell me. If I do not understand, I will ask them  to clarify. If I still do not understand or have any additiol questions, I will go home and research the issue myself. 
1	I feel that I am capable of doing so. I have trust in the skill and discretion of medical professiols that I'm not worried about interacting with them. If I need help I am sure I can get it, but I am generally comfortable with forms.
-1	I feel completely confident for the questions that I answered about my capacity to obtain,process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions as I am well educated and know my rights and also I can gather more information from outside sources to enhance my knowledge.I always interact with people to understand on various health information related information to gather more knowledge.I am quite aware of mine and my family health issues.
1	I'm a 48 year old high school educated male, tive speaker and reader of the English language.  I have the internet at my fingertips.  Anything I do not understand, I have the ability to research on my own.  I am very comfortable doing this.
-1	I believe I can obtain, process, and understand most information most of the time. If I have questions I ask the doctor or a nurse. 
1	Based on the questions I just answered I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and to make the appropriate health decisions. The fact that I can understand spoken and written language along with an interest in making health decisions gives me confidence.
-1	I feel like I have the capacity somewhat to understand health information to make decisions. If things are too complicated or the doctor talks too fast, then I can always ask them to clarify or explain it to me again. I can also access a vast amount of information online to research any questions that I might have. 
1	I feel that I am able to take care of my own medical needs in relationship to reading and understanding the given material.  If I do not understand the given material or instructions I am sure to ask a question so I have all the information I need. 
1	I am a very educated individual and I like to be as informed as possible. I take great care of my body and health so I am always asking questions if I have any and I never worry about asking a stupid question. I am very alytical and I want to know all the details so I always dig in and do the proper research.
1	I am currently uninsured. I have Graves Disease so, have seen many doctors in the past. The disease itself is a little hard to understand but I ask all of the questions I have and usually get fairly clear answers.
1	I feel I have basic knowledge of these things so I have a basic capacity to process these things. There is so much information available online sometimes I feel I can never learn enough. 
1	Since I have not had experiences with uncommon disease or sickness, except from regular health check and common cold, I do not really have much more experience with health information and services.  In fact, aside from some emergencies in my teege and younger years visit to hospital due to injury, accident, the past 8 years, the only time I have to stop by the doctor was to drive someone else close to me for health check up.  Because of this, as far as health information and services needed for me, I am up to date on most of them, plus I am rather good at internet when I need to do research on something peculiar related to health
-1	Sometimes i have a hard time understanding certain medical procedures or whenever a doctor is explaining things to me. I do ask questions but i do not always understand the answers and sometimes i need help filling out forms because i don't know what to put.
1	I feel confident that I can understand the information given to me by the doctor and pharamcy. I am confident when I read over the instructions on how to take medications and the possible side effects. I have no problem with asking my doctor questions if I don't understand what they are telling me. I may not ask all the questions that I need to at the time of the appointment. The questions might not come to me until later. I feel confident filling out medical forms. 
1	I am quite capable of reading and understanding health information and services.  I used to work in the insurance industry for 15 years in a variety of positions and I had the opportunity to learn many things about health, medical, insurance, etc. and have no trouble with forms. 
-1	I think that I could understand all of the basics...if I had a disease or some special new circumstances, that might be more difficult.  The biggest barrier for me would be speaking up and asking questions.  I am impatient, sometimes I don't want to hear an elaboration on something that scares me, and/or I may feel like I have already taken up enough of the doctor's time.  All of these could be potential barriers for me.
-1	I'm more or less able to comprehend most information regarding medical information and decisions. If and when I find myself confused by something, it is usually due to the manner in which it was written (i.e. It contained unnecessary legalese or terms with which I'm unfamiliar). If I ever find myself having reservations about making making decisions, I am usually able to speak with someone (a receptionist or patient care advocate) who is able to clarify information for me.
-1	Filling out basic health information is not a problem for me. My weakest area is asking questions so that I understand exactly what the doctor/nurse is saying. Sometimes I just don't know the right questions to ask.
-1	I think I ask all the question I want answers to. But I don't asks questions I don't want to know the answers to. Such as smoking.
1	I don't feel like I have any trouble understanding and processing the information I receive.  Even if I don't understand something right away, I know where to go to get help figuring it all out.
-1	I think that on average I am moderately knowledgeable when it comes to health issues, however I comfortable and feel it is within my rights to ask the healthcare professiols any questions that helps me clarify any information, procedures or recommendations they may have.
-1	I feel like I definitely have the capacity to process and understand health information. Sometimes if there are too many technical terms being used I might have to ask either my doctor or someone else (my sister is an RN so I can call her and ask for her help) to explain in more plain language. But most of the time I don't have a problem. As far as obtaining services and information, that's a little bit trickier. There's the issue of services being available or not available in my area, long waits to see a doctor, and the massive cost of seeing a doctor. And I've had a few issues where I've gone to the ER or the walk-in clinic in my town and ended up seeing a doctor who doesn't seem to care about explaining what's going on to me. But overall I feel like I can probably make appropriate health decisions. Not 100% confident, but at least 70-80%.
-1	I do feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health info because whenever I don't understand something I am the first one to ask for a clarification.  I study the info very often with my husband and we collaborate and anything we don't have a grasp of, we set aside time to understand it. So I am more then confident that I can make appropriate health decisions.
1	I am pretty familiar with medical terminology and how things work.  I am able to successfully google any information I don't know.  I never just take a doctor on their word and do ask questions and do my own research.  Doctors are not always right, whether they are new, stuck in a prescribing rut or have chosen not to be reeducated on current practices for a particular symptom/illness.
1	I know how to fill out forms and ask and answer questions when dealing with doctors and nurses. I don't think it takes multiple sentences to impart that information.
1	Normally when I don't understand something that is hospital related, I do ask enough questions to help me understand what is going on. I also do some research online. 
1	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I feel this way because I do not hesitate to request more information and clarification.  I also feel comfortable seeking out information on my own.
1	My mother was a nurse and my father was an EMT so I grew up around medical terminology. I am used to hearing medical words and I feel like I am highly capable of processing and understanding basic health information. I often have an idea of what is wrong with me even before the doctor's diagnosis.
1	I like to follow all instructions given to me by my doctor. I like to read everything the doctor gives to me, especially medications. If there is something I do not understand, I am not hesitant in the slightest to look for something on the internet. 
1	I have a fairly good understanding of  medical terminology having worked in a benefits related industry and also what is required to make a proper diagnosis.
1	I feel that I high capacity to obtain, process and understand health information. I took a nursing class in college and while I would not diagnose myself or others with the information I received from taking the class, it allows me to understand a decent amount of medical language. 
1	I am cognizant of my health condition and fully able to make my own decisions. I easily understand the options available to me and what course of medical treatment offers the best outcomes.  
-1	I struggle at times to understand printed material, particularly literature about prescribed medicines. Sometimes I have difficulty understanding a doctor's verbal explations, especially since they are always short on time. 
-1	I think I would be able to obtain what I needed in order to get a general understanding of a condition.
1	I can almost always understand and remember what a doctor or nurse tells me. I understand all basic medical terminology as well as some more advanced terms.
-1	I feel pretty confident in my ability to receive information that will allow me to make appropriate health decisions. I realize a lot of other people lie or omit information when dealing with health care professions and this seems completely counter-intuitive me so I try my best to be open and honest in my communications.
-1	I feel I am able to understand and process basic health information because of my education. If it is basic info I can usually follow along or I am capable of using the internet to clarify things I might find confusing. 
-1	Pretty good. Not illiterate. Can read.
1	I am very capable of processing and understanding basic health information. First we have the lovely world wide web and there are A LOT of reputable sources to get information. Just need to make sure it is indeed reputable, like Web MD. I also do not have issues getting information from health professiols when I need it, that's what they are there for.
1	I understand basic health information very well. If I need to I can always go to a reputable medical organization on the internet. I have worked in a Dr's.  office and familiar with basic medical terminology. 
1	I have the knowledge and ability to be forthright and ask questions when I don't understand something.   Even if I was really scared of a diagnosis, I would not be afraid to find out any of the info I was looking for.     It goes across the board and would involve information, services, and billing.
-1	I think I've got a pretty average capacity to obtain and understand health information and services. I don't always know everything I need to know, but I'm not too bad at researching things and can often find things out on my own. I'm not an expert though, so it's possible for me to miss out on things or misunderstand some information.
1	Almost perfectly. I am a good reader, have good reading comprehension,and frequently refer to Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins when I need more or expanded information on my or a friends medical concern.. 
-1	I feel like I have a higher degree of understanding about basic health information than the average person and my family.  Because health interests me, I like to read about conditions I have experienced or those around me have had on my own as well as speak to friends who have medical degrees.  I think I absorb what I hear about basic health information really well and retain it because I am so fascited by it.  Also, I have had some family members with serious medical issues so have had a lot of practice having to make choices and ask questions.
-1	I believe I understand well enough what questions I should ask pertaining to my ailment. I am sometimes hesitant to ask some questions I deem embarrassing, though.
-1	For most of the real basic stuff, I get it. But when it gets more complicated with medical words being spoken to me, I get a little lost. I always have my husband with me in the doctor's office to make sure I don't miss something. 
-1	I feel like, given my individual circumstances, I can easily obtain and understand basic health information and services. This is likely due to the fact that I enjoy reading and learning and have taken an interest in the medical/scientific fields in general (particularly in psychiatry, as I have mental health issues). One area that does cause problems for me, though, is that I am a drug addict and I am generally reluctant to tell healthcare professiols exactly what drugs I may or may not be on, due to the stigma attached to my habits.
1	i have no issues filling anything out. i normally have a good idea whats wrong with me due to healthcare websites like webmd and such. it is typically hard to ask questions to a doctor because they usually are running behind and are in and out of the room in less than 5 minutes so they are not always available to answer all questions if i have any
1	I feel I can make informed decisions and obtain necessary information as I have friends who I can consult and also use the internet when I need to read and find out more about certain topics. 
1	I never have too much of a problem understanding what they tell me, and when I do, I always ask questions until I know I understand completely what's going on. Other times I'll research on my own time what they tell me if I'm still not completely satisfied, or if I just want to know a little extra about something.
1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand all of my health information. I believe in taking charge of ones own health care, doing careful research and working with my physician to make the best health care decisions for myself.
-1	I generally feel that I can understand the basics but dont fully grasp the overall picture. Sometimes I dont get how some aspects relate to other things but I am slowly learning to ask more questions or to ask family and friends for further clarification. But I generally feel I  can understand the basics.
1	I feel very confident in acquiring information from health professiols when needed. I am also confident in my own exploration of health information on the internet. 
1	I have a high degree of being able to understand health information. My doctor is excellent with explaining and making sure I understand. I have also used Google to search for health knowledge.
-1	I feel like I can get by fairly well. I always ask my doctor questions, and when there are things on forms I don't understand (or I have a nurse help me). I don't understand everything on medical papers, but I think I know enough to gauge health decisions.
-1	I think I have a good capacity to obtain help when I need to make decisions concerning my health. I have family members who are able to help me fill out forms when I don't understand certain questions. The doctors and nurses are pretty helpful as well when I don't understand something, whether that deals with information I'm filling out or the information they give me concerning their judgement on my health. All in all, I haven't had too much trouble in this area. 
-1	I do understand the process of decisions for my health care, and if I am confused I then ask my doctor or nurse
-1	I mainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services, although I do have difficulty with communication due to having high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder. I tend to not ask questions that I should ask because of being uncomfortable with communication.
1	I feel confident in my ability to handle health information. I have a background in health insurance, so that part of the equation is very easily understood. I also have fine research skills, a large vocabulary and enough general experience at the age of 48, that I know how to find out anything, of which I am unsure. I'm ufraid to speak with health care professiols. 
1	i think i am about average, i have had some but limited experience 
1	I think I have a good knowledge base and am confident that, for the most part, I understand the directions my doctor and nurses give me, along with the materials and directions given to me afterward. I make sure to ask questions, but I will be honest and say that I often forget some of the things I want to ask before I go in during the exam. I
1	"I feel that I can do all of the above on my own very well. Usually, I would just ask for ""help"" or advice from someone if I have been diagnosed with something they have previously had if I had any questions about it. I was also responsible for my grandma's health decisions and went to all of her appointments with her."
1	I'm not shy. I have no trouble talking to people in normal situations and important matters such as my health I'm even less likely to remain silent. If I have questions I ask. Even at routine medical checkups I have questions for my doctor either about the current situation or some other issue that has been bugging me.
-1	I have taken medical terminology I and II and earned A's in both. I have also done some research on my conditions. Because of that, I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I've even taken a nutrition course.
-1	I have a pretty good grasp on my health and health issues. I do a lot of research on the chronic conditions I have as well as the treatments and medications. Most of the information I obtain comes from trusted sources on the Internet rather than my health professiols. Many times I feel like just a number to my health care providers.
1	I am pretty certain that I am capable to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. I mostly do not need help in understanding any information given to me. On rare occasions that I do need to as a few questions to better understand the information, I was always given clear answers by my doctors or nurses.
-1	I feel that I have a moderate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. The reason for this is that I can usually understand and process basic information, but when it comes to things such as specific terms or words I do not understand them which causes me to not understand more things. I sometimes also do not ask all of the questions I should  if I do not fully understand something. 
-1	I think it can be difficult because they are just trying to push the protocols on you and not necessarily do what is helpful to you or what you want. Especially in the case of my pregncies. I also do not understand the labs and stuff like that and I always have to ask and usually they dont even give you a copy, only when you go to a specialist or something then you see. I have heard that you can ask for a copy of your medical information the same day of your appointment and they give it for free but I feel intimidated because they make it seem like they charge you and they know better like why would you be asking questions. 
1	I have enough experience on the matter to know what is being considered. I know what is told me and I know the basic issues. I can understand what is provided and make appropriate choices.
-1	Even if I don't initially understand all the information, I try to ask questions to help me understand further. I also have a close family member who is a registered nurse who has helped me at times. I try to use good resources on the internet for information.
1	I can understand all information provided to me in order to make appropriate health decisions. 
-1	I think that I will need to some research before making a decision. 
-1	I understand what they tell me for the most part, but I do get hung up on the science behind it sometimes. If I don't understand the science I research it a bit online to get a better understanding because I'm slow on stuff like that.
1	I believe I have the capabilities to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I know how to ask questions and find help understanding anything that I could find confusing 
-1	I feel confident in my capacity to understand health information to make good health decisions.  Sometimes I think I have too much information, rather than too little, since the internet has much information on health these days. Once I've met with clinicians though I do believe they are able to sift through any problems I have in order to give me the proper care.
-1	I feel like I know a lot of the information given to me. Many times, however, I only understand the basics.  When doctors start going into the science of the problem I get confused. I usually don't have a problem obtaining my patient information. 
1	I think I have the capability to understand my health concerns. I am not afraid to ask doctors any questions about any concerns I may have and I'm also not worried about appearing ignorant if I need any clarification or explation of different medical terms.  Also, the internet allows me to do further research into any health topic I want to learn about.
-1	I think I'm smart enough to understand most medical information. I find for me on thing that does not help is on the internet you can almost find contradictions to any medical recommendation. Diet, supplements, vaccitions all have opposing views for the general medical advice given.
1	I feel that I am more than equipped to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  I do not have a background in medicine but I my comprehension and alysis skills are high.  If there was anything that I did not understand, I would research it until I did.  Good health is a high priority.
-1	I try to pay close attention to what the Dr. says.  If I'm not sure what the problem is I ask them to explain better.
-1	I believe I have huge experience in this field, as my wife is ill for couple years and I'm talking to radio and chemo-therapy doctors. Not by choice, but I think I'm pretty capable... 
-1	I think I certainly have the literacy skills. I read and write better than most people I know and have a good vocabulary. But I don't have a lot of specialized medical knowledge, so sometimes I do feel like I don't have all the information I need to make a good decision or to understand what a doctor tells me. I think compared to most other people who aren't doctors or nurses, I'm doing well, but there are still a few times when I wish I were more confident.
-1	If I need help I can call the office and ask.  But sometimes I don't ask.
-1	I feel that I have a basic understanding of information and to process everything to make appropriate medical decisions, but sometimes there is a depth to these processes that require a deeper understanding.
1	I feel I have great capacity to understand health information given to me, as well as make decisions for myself. If I have any questions, I am usually thorough about asking them to healthcare professiols.
-1	I feel like I can answer about all of the questions right. Usually they are pretty straight forward.  They don't use too much jargon that the average person cannot understand.  Very rarely sometimes the questions are worded in a way that you don't know what answer they are looking for.
-1	I have a decent capacity for those things but I definitely need some help understanding some things. A lot of what I see seems to be written in a foreign language so I sometimes ask for help. I definitely need to ask more questions when I am speaking with a nurse or doctor. I just feel like I am asking a stupid question so I am too nervous to speak up
1	I feel like I am very able to understand and obtain health information and services that I need. I have a pretty thorough backing in biology and have taken atomy and physiology classes in college, so that gives me a good working knowledge of anything that a medical professiol needs to communicate to me. I also have good health insurance through my husband's employer, and so have always been able to obtain medical care when I have needed it. I am also in good health and am generally self-confident so I don't really feel intimidated at the doctor's office and therefore have never had a problem asking a doctor or nurse for a clarification or additiol information. 
-1	I need it broken down better into easy to process words that i am familiar with to understand better. I feel sometimes the information is jus thrown at me and i would like it written down on papers so i can refer back to what i have and need todo for it and the medications.
-1	I feel as though I can process most information fairly well. I have had issues in the past with having a lack of confidence in doctors explaining, but never my own understanding. 
1	I have no problem asking a health professiol any questions to clarify anything I don't understand. Some Drs speak in medical terms and I often have to ask them to explain in layman's terms. My current Dr is extremely good about explaining everything and is more than willing to answer any and all questions.
-1	I have full access to the internet. If a health care professiol does not provide information to answer all the questions I have (which come up after the visit), I look online.  I do not use blogs for the most part. I use credible sources for information.  Of course, if I have questions that cannot be answered at that point, I reach out to my PCP.  My PCP is actually available via internet for me, so I use that resource when appropriate. I have a small healthcare background as well, so I feel I am able to understand and comprehend better than someone with no healthcare background.
-1	I feel it to a moderate degree. When in doubt, I usually consult with my sister, who is a nurse practitioner. 
-1	I usually feel like I'm able to get enough information. Certain situations can make me flustered and uncomfortable, which sometimes limits how I interact. I do feel like there are more chances these days to get the information you need beyond the actual care interactions.
-1	I think I have a reasobly high capacity of health information.
1	I know that I have the capacity to understand medical documents and filling them out. Occasiolly I have my doctor explain something if I don't understand it but for the most part I do. 
1	I feel like I am very capable in making health decisions.
1	I  do not have any medical training but I can always pick up the phone and  call my doctor and  ask questions 
-1	For the most part I understand what I am being told and if they use a term I am unfamiliar with I usually will ask follow up questions.  I will also sometimes search online to find the meaning of some things.  
1	I am extremely proficient at maging my health. I live a very healthy lifestyle and my great health reflects that. I understand exactly what i must do to maintain great health.
-1	Sometimes it can be difficult to obtain your health records due to the office being too busy. It can also be difficult to have them explain in detail what is going on with you because they have so many patients and not a lot of time.
-1	I think i have a decent capability. I can go out and try and find any info i am missing.
1	I think I have a great ability to understand what doctors and nurses are trying to tell me. I am familiar with some of the language used to describe medical conditions, and I tend to ask questions in areas that I'm not strong with. 
-1	With all the doctors and nurses help I feel like I can make adequate decisions in my Healthcare.  Doctors and nurses are always really helpful and I feel like I can rely on them  
-1	When a doctor or health professiol is there in front of me, I am usually comfortable asking questions and finding out answers. In this case it is usually pretty easy and straightforward as these people are usually able to help. However, when I do not have one of these people, finding the answers to my questions is much harder. I usually use the internet to find my answers but finding a reliable source on the internet is not always easy. 
-1	To a certain degree. I can understand most of the basic health information but decisions are a little bit difficult to make.
1	I feel I have a good doctor and am able to openly communicate and discuss issues with them. I am open about my health issues which I think you need to be in order to get the help you need. I understand for the most part what the Dr says and what I am not sure of I ask questions. My husband will also ask questions which further helps with any questions that may arise or answers we may need. My husband and I share the same Doctor and we typically schedule appointments at the same time so the Doctor sees us together in an hour block.  This also helps us communicate better as we are both there and can both ask questions we may have
-1	I feel pretty confident. I have taken some medical classes in the past and that has really helped with explaining and being able to break down medical terminology  I also have a nurse for a mother so it makes it really easy to get answers to questions or if I don't understand something.
1	I feel as though I can understand everything a doctor tells me in order to make decisions. If there is something that I don't understand, I have no problem asking the doctor to explain.
-1	I don't have obama care, so I don't feel I have access
-1	I feel like I'm pretty god at understanding my medical conditions and history. I'm young enough that I don't have a ton to deal with.  I will ask the doctor when I visit if I don't understand something.
-1	I feel that I am able to comprehend what I am told by my doctors. While I sometimes have a hard time understanding the insurance benefits I do understand and am able to fill out all the necessary forms and documentation. I normally understand what I am told about my health and treatments.
-1	I think that I have the capacity of the average person to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. At times, I do need assistance filling out forms because I am afraid that I will do so improperly and they will not have all the information needed because I misinterpreted a question. Also at times, I try to process the information they give me and am afraid to ask questions so I then go home and search on the internet for further information. 
-1	I have full capacity to process and understand basic health information to make health decisions
-1	I feel very comfortable. I have no issues talking to doctors. I will tell them anything. I don't worry about holding anything back. I usually understand everything they say, and if I don't I ask questions. 
1	I feel like I have all appropriate knowledge and information. I can obtain all necessary info and feel good talking with medical professiols about my health.
1	i can do research and ask questions
-1	I feel semi-confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services. I do find difficulty when attempting to get answers from health professiols. I generally notice that health professiols automatically assume that people have a general understanding of all aspects regarding health but I don't believe this is the case. This makes decision making more difficult. 
1	i have have no problem understanding medical language and if i do have a question i call back after i get home
1	I have full capacity to understand all the basic health information and services because I have experience with the medical field. Not only that, I am fluent in English, so I am able to make deductions based on what I already know. 
1	I feel I do for the most part.  I know basic stuff
-1	I'm quite capable of understanding what doctors are telling and reading medical documents. I have a background reading in scientific research, so understanding the technical side of things is quite easy for me.
-1	I feel like I can obtain and process basic health information effectively. It's only when there is a complication that I don't always get the information I need or follow up material to make an informed decision. Or sometimes I don't think of  question till long after I have left the doctor's office.
-1	I think I do have the capacity to deal with the health information that I get. I am always sure to not leave the doctor's office or hospital with unswered questions. I try to search on the web first and I make a list of all the things I would like to ask so I don't leave details without answer.
-1	Based on the questions I answered, I realized I don't understand much about health information. There are many terms used that I don't know and often I don't know where to start asking questions. If information were described to me in simple terms, I would be able to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I understand everything any medical professiol can tell me and ask questions if I don't.
-1	if i don't understand something and i am not at the doctor's office, i can ask a family member to help me or go online for help. the answers are there, you just have to ask a person or online.
-1	I am a pretty smart guy with decent insurance and family in medical fields, so I wouldn't have much trouble obtaining this type of information.  I am also not afraid to ask as many questions as I need to in order to fully understand any medical questions.
-1	I feel fairly competent to obtain and understand health information that is given to me. I studied biology in college (it was my major) and was considering going into medicine, but decided on another field later on. I have accumulated a lot of knowledge on health issues and factors over the years, through reading online and keeping track of my own health. 
1	While I lack medical expertise on any of its subjects, I in general have good reading comprehension and can at least partially understand things that I don't know about using context. I also know how to ask good questions, when necessary, and have good research skills to investigate a lot of things on my own. 
-1	"I think that the doctors who I am a patient under are generally capable of explaining my problems to me. The forms are also easy enough to understand. The problem starts with me and my disconnect between doctors. I don't speak the language of medicine, and I don't know how to properly express symptoms. So there is a moment when the doctor asks me if I have any questions, but I say I do not. I only come to find out days or weeks later that I should have asked certain questions when I run into problems. For instance, I never used to consider the side effects of medications until I started suffering them, and when I did start to talk to doctors about them I could not just say ""tell me about the side effects,"" because they would only discuss the most common ones. If not for the fact that I suffered rare side effects, I would not have known that you have to push the issue in order to learn about the effects doctors feel aren't worth mentioning."
1	COMPLETELY
1	I think I have complete capacity to obtain my health information and also understand what I am reading or being told. When there is something I do not understand I have never had a problem asking questions or finding someone to help me better understand the information.
-1	I'm not confident at all that I obtain what I need to. A lot of the blame lies with me I guess. I am a nervous person, and I usually want to get away from people ( especially medical people) fast. If they seem busy or annoyed, I fell like running away. Fortutely I have a very nice DR. who usually explains a lot of what I need to know without me asking. 
1	I have no problem understanding what is said by my doctor or on written forms. I am capable of asking questions about anything I do not understand, but since I have no problem understanding what I am being told or reading, this situation does not come up. Anything I am not sure of, I do my own research on.
-1	I have good common sense, so therefore I can understand things that are common. When it comes to the technical terms and jargon of the medical profession I like to get help just so that I do not misunderstand anything
-1	To an extent, I understand what they say.. But there are times where I need the doctor or nurse to better explain what's going on especially if there are decisions on treatments and etc.
1	I have taken human atomy and physiology in high school and I have taken a health class, so I am aware of a lot of basic information that they would tell you. Most results I have obtained in the past few years are online, which usually give you more information than you need.
-1	I feel like I have an above average knowledge of health information. My mom and dad both work in the health industry and I have learned a lot from them through out the years. I have also done some own private research on some health topics as it interests me.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to understand and ask questions, but I rarely ask or mention everything I want to. I usually think that the medical professiol will think I'm wasting their time, and don't speak up.
-1	I feel like I have a very good capacity to understand my medical history,  The only time I really had a problem, was when I was having brain seizures and I was going into a coma.  People were explaining things, but I could not understand what they were saying.
-1	Sometimes I struggle to understand what Doctors say if it just scientific medical jargon. I also worry that they are just trying to legally protect themselves by stating things so matter of factually. Usually nurses are the ones who explain things to me in more of an understandable way.
-1	I am completely capable to understand basic health information . I sometimes have trouble understanding the medications and how they explain things on a piece of paper. But i always ask them when i have a doubt about something and when explain it i completely understand.
-1	"I feel like I have a pretty high capacity to obtain and process health information. Thankfully, I've lived a very healthy life and haven't had all that many interactions with healthcare professiols. But I owe that in part to my interest in health, exercise, and nutrition on a hobby level. I've studied a variety of health topics simply because it interests me; over the years I've read dozens of books on health and nutrition, disease, and pharmacology. I'm a curious person that likes to know how things work, and the human body happens to be one of those things I like to learn about. I read a number of health related blogs, occasiolly listen to health related podcasts, and have even dug in to scientific papers in medical jourls before. So I have much more background information than the typical person - nowhere near that of a medical professiol of course, but I can ""talk the talk"" better than most on a variety of health related topics, I believe. If anything, I'm more confused by the bureaucratic side of things. Insurance plans and coverage, law and tax related issues etc. are about as complex as the human body itself these days. I can't quite get myself as interested to learn more about that, but I know if I needed to research details of my plan or my options, I'm confident I could find and process that information too."
1	I feel I have average or better capability.
-1	I am married with a nurse .She is working at a hospital.Though my health is pretty good,I had 2 back surgeries 2 years ago.I had to fill in some forms and read some information,and she was of great help.She knows,what I have to ask and knows the meaning of the difficult words.
1	I feel I have a capacity greater than most others in my age group to understand health information. I come from a family of health professiols and have a good vocabulary when it comes to healthcare terms. I also worked as a CSR for a major heath insurance company for a couple years.
-1	Most people in the medical profession talk and explain things to fast for me to fully process the information at the moment. I feel much more comfortable having a family member with me when I talk to someone in the medical profession. Having a family member there helps when getting all the information being presented.
1	I feel I have a well developed capacity for obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information.  I always take a list of questions to ask my doctor (if I need to), and I do not leave his office until I am sure I understand everything I need to know about my condition, medications, and altertive forms of therapy.  I have to be my own health care advocate, because no one else will do it for me.
-1	"I think I have the ability to get all the information I need.   When it comes to health, I will not leave a stone unturned and I will ask questions even if they are ""stupid"" to make sure I have the clarity that I need."
1	i have the pretty much capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions....
-1	I feel like I'm fully capable. Anything I'm unsure of I can always look up on the internet. 
1	I feel I am fully competent to do this. I have regular appointments for various reasons, and I fill out these kinds of forms regularly. I always understand what I'm reading, and if I don't I ask.
1	I believe I can handle all the healthcare information myself. I am a mother and have spent my life covering health issues for my children, and sadly my husband also. Because I put myself in that position, I spent a lot of time figuring out how to deal with all the decisions and paperwork and communication that were needed to deal with health issues. 
1	I am confident in my ability to understand and ask appropriate questions on health information and services
-1	I usually can do this. I am of sound mind and have adequate education. But sometimes I might need  someone to help me out.
-1	Relatively well but often times I feel my doctors just regurgitate what they learned in a book and follow what is in a book often ignoring any pain I have and prescribing me pain medication instead of fixing the problem. Often times when I ask why they will simply dumb down the answer as a categorization of allergies or an old injury without going in depth into the cause when I feel I deserve a longer explation. 
-1	Some information needs explaining,but you can usually find good information if you can access the internet. As long as it is not very specialized information.
-1	I always try to be sure that I understand whatever I am told by the doctor (or other medical person).  But sometimes they are in a hurry and I might be asking for details that they don't think matter so they don't really explain everything.  Like when I took my child to the doctor with a fever and the doctor said be sure the child get plenty of fluids.  I understood that, but I asked why is that important and was just told that it is and see you later.  
-1	The internet helps me look up things. If I don't understand something I can always look up information online. 
1	I feel that the information is obtaible, it's more a matter of knowing where to go to obtain the information you need. It's the starting point that is the biggest challenge.
1	I feel that understand most of what health care professiols tell me. There are some things that I don't understand but always ask for better explations. I try not to walk away without understanding everything that was told to me so that I can make thoughtful decisions.
-1	I believe I can obtain and understand all written material. When it comes to spoken material given by healthcare providers, they Often do not answer all my questions or allow time for me to give all my questions.
1	I FEEL I HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN, PROCESS, AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTHINFORMATION AS I AM A FAIRLY INTELLIGENT PERSON, AM NOT SHY ABOUT ASKING THINGS ABOUT WHICH I HAVE LITTLE BACKGROUND OR UNDERSTANDING (PARTICULARLY ABOUT THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE-SUCH AS HEALTH MATTER), AND HAVE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH HEALTH ISSUES, PROFESSIOLS, AND THE ASSOCIATED FORMS. ALL OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE HAD SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS AND EXZTENDED HOSPITAL STAYS, AND I HAD TO SUPERITEND A COUPLE OF THOSE. MY KIDS AND WIFE SIMILARLY. I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THIS STUFF.
1	I can read, understand and process basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions easily. I do not have difficulty to deal with these issues because I have visited my primary doctor routinely, and have enough medical knowledge on these aspects.
1	I feel that between asking questions and finding someone to help me understand information, I have the ability to make appropriate health decisions. If I am not sure about something I will ask my doctor or nurse and search for all the information needed to make a good decision.
1	I feel I have enough common sense to ask the relative questions I need to and if not I am able to search and find answers to any other questions I may have when not in the doctor's office.
1	I have the ability to read, research, ask questions and do anything else I need to understand the basic health information and services I need to satisfy my doctor and my insurance. I am not afraid to ask question. I feel I can obtain, process and understand everything I need or find a way to understand it.
-1	To a great degree, because I research everything. My husband is afflicted with several chronic conditions, and I am his only care giver. I cannot tell you how many doctors and nurses for sub par care and blatant mistakes.
-1	I believe I have the necessary capacity to needed to understand health information relating to health decisions. I have a basic working understanding of my own health and information relating to my diagnosed conditions.  Although if the material I am given is not presented in non-medical terms, I may need assistance or elaboration to understand fully. 
-1	I feel pretty confident until I actually get to the Drs office - it can be overwhelming. Nerve racking. You forget what you want to say (i try to write things down) but also, it sometimes goes so fast that you forget or blank out.  It always helps when the Dr gives you pamplets, but those can also be either vague or way too much info or jargon.
1	I am well read about my medical conditions and aggressive in finding options for treatment.  As an example several diagnostic tests were order, the cost for these tests would have been over 1,200.00 but I found a the same tests offered by a non-profit through a local hospital for 168.00.
-1	I guess after answering your questions I guess sometimes I need help but I think I am pretty knowledgeable about health.
-1	I think in a serious medical situation we are all a bit nervous and anxious, I always go with my parents so I can listen and ask questions and later explain if necessary.  When I go to the doctor I am usually alone and I find it difficult getting the doctor to listen to me, to actually hear what I am saying.  Sometimes I feel like they've just made up their mind and they need me to move along as quickly as possible.  I usually end up just leaving with questions unswered.
-1	I have a great support system in my wife who is a Pediatric ED nurse who I lean on for explations and understanding of complex medical terms and situations.
-1	I am not shy and a fairly good talker so I usually talk with nurse s and I can usually get whatever information is needed. If something is a bit fuzzy that I approved (or need time to approve) I will go home and Google it. Plus I can also go by my own experience and decide if something is appropriate for me. If I still don't have the answer I will call or talk more in person if needed.
1	I find that I often understand basic health information and medical instructions better than many people. I'm sometimes asked to help others because I am competent in this area. If there's something I don't understand I do some research until I feel comfortable with the material; or if I don't get enough information from my own research, I feel comfortable asking for help from the staff at my doctor's office or other medical professiols.
1	Understanding basic health information isnt too difficult to make a good health decision. If I ever had question, I always ask the doctor or a professiol. It would make sense to do a cardio workout if you are sick.
1	I am not afraid to ask questions, which is very important. I will do further research online to see what else are my altertives, and then ask about them. I also have family in the health field to consult with if I have a major decision to make.
1	I feel I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I feel my reasoning skills are above average as well as my problem-solving skills which allow me to be successful in this task.
1	when i am told something i understand it and if i dont understand it i ask  for more information  so that i can under stand it
1	In have complete capacity to obtain, process and understand ant health information that I have. I rarely need to ask questions for clarification and can very easily comprehend most information.
-1	I feel I can understand most things in these instructions but at times I come to something that doesnt make sense in its wording.
-1	I feel that I am mostly capable of comprehending and reading all health information and services when needed. However, there are occasions when the content and details are a bit confusing and guidance is needed for me.
1	I am a middle aged man who has no problem understanding English. I have a college degree in the sciences, so yes, I can understand technical instructions. If something is unclear I can ask a nurse or doctor to explain it further. I also have a good relationship with my doctor so conversations come easy. 
-1	I definitely have the capacity but sometimes I am tentative to ask for clarification of things or ask the doctor for more information because I do not want to sound stupid or get nervous of the answers if I ask more. I'm also young so I sometimes need to speak with my parents before filling out forms and such.
1	I am very confident in my ability to understand and process my health information. If I amd unsure of something I feel confident in most cases to ask for more information.
1	Yes I feel that I can usually determine the right questions to ask.  I know where to look for information either from my doctors or other health professiols.  I also feel I know how to research my health problems fairly well.
-1	I believe as long as I understand the diagnosis I am fine. I may question some of the side effects in which I could get and also forms referencing any sort of insurance information. As the information pertains to my health or my insurance I am very clear on understanding what is being put into it at that time.
1	Even if I have trouble understanding something (I can usually figure it out on my own), my sister is a medical biller, and I can always do a Google/Web MD search to answer any other questions.
-1	I typically don't have a problem understanding the information given to me. However, there are times that I want to get additiol information regarding a condition or treatment and I find it difficult to actually get a hold of anyone that is competent enough to fulfill my request. The doctors are either too busy or just too short on their answers to provide me with an adequate enough answer. 
-1	I know I can make my own decisions. Sometimes I do go online and do research before talking to my doctor. I also get the opinions of family members.
-1	I feel pretty good about my ability to understand what is needed. When I don't I will ask questions and many times my husband is with me and ask questions to. I try and listen to what is being said very carefully, listening is half the battle. 
1	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information that is provided to me by various medical providers. I do not usually have any fear of speaking up and asking a question when a doctor says something that I am not immediately familiar with. I also do research online regarding what possible side effects/outcomes i might experience and have a general idea before going to see a medical professiol.
1	I believe I have the mental capacity to understand basic health information.  I would then feel confident in taking the appropriate and correct health decisions for myself.  
1	I feel that I have a high ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I am smart, well read, and confident in my abilities to research and learn.  I also have no problem asking a care provider questions if I'm unclear on something they've said.
1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I am going to be 72 later in the year, but I still feel my brain is functiolly quite well. If I need help, it is usually to offer feedback about a potential decision. I do think I understand medical stuff as well as the average person.
-1	Based on my experience, I don't have much problem in relation to medical advice and documents, to the fact that I am a very particular person and if times that I am confused, I am always eager to show my concern. I won't let things happen without understanding because I don't want to put myself at risk especially with regards to my health
-1	I feel that I have the ability to understand health information if explained in a clear and concise manner by a nurse or doctor. As a college educated individual, I have the capacity to process the information explained to me and understand more by doing individual research.
1	I'm generally fine at understanding any information or materials given to me. I can normally fill out forms, etc., fine, but I'm always anxious I'll make a mistake. I don't always ask questions when it might be appropriate, which I sometimes regret later when I realize there's information I needed. Sometimes I get nervous that I've forgotten or misremembered information that was only given to me verbally without any notes or other method of recording it, but I've never actually experienced any bad outcomes.
-1	I feel like I definitely have the capacity. Some things are harder to understand but most I can comprehend fairly well
-1	I feel that I have full capacity to obtain basic health information and make the appropriate health decision.  There is so much available information on the internet nowadays that basically anyone with computer knowledge is able to find what they need. Websites like WebMD, among others, helps the everyday person find out about basic health information, diagnosis of conditions/diseases, effective treatments, etc. 
-1	English my second language. thus I am not understanding some of the medical terms. But, I believe,it is not affecting to take appropriate health decisions.
-1	I feel that I am very much capable of understanding basic health information.  The information provided via handouts, papers, etc. however can be tough to decipher sometimes though.  The language used is not always easy to understand.
1	I am able to understand the information the doctors tell me very well.  I am able to read the documents and understand what they mean.  I am a smart guy.  
-1	I have no problems understanding basic health information.  If I do not fully understand something related to my health, I can either get an explation from my medical providers or do some basic research on my own until I understand the issue. 
1	I have had a number of medical issues over the years that have required me to be active and proactive in my medical care.  I am very able to ask the right questions, seek out information from the doctor or internet and have the initiative to find out my next steps in the process.
1	There are some times when the terminology is difficult to understand, but I make sure that I always ask what I need to in order to understand. Then I look up information online from reputable sources and write our more questions to ask later. I have no problem filling out forms and I am usually okay with everything that I am learning, at least as far as understanding everything goes. 
1	I believe I am completely capable of understanding any health information that is relayed to me by a medical professiol. I am not afraid to ask questions if there is something that I do not understand. Additiolly, I am comfortable with using the internet to find more information about any conditions I may have.
-1	I belief I have access to get the required information and what I can't get on my own I will consult a doctor or nurse. 
1	I believe I have a thorough enough knowledge of basic health information.  However, I would probably always defer to the recommendation of the doctor since I can't be 100% sure of all altertives and their consequences.
1	I think about average. I wouldn't say I'm well educated, but I'm fairly intelligent and can grasp basic information. I'm able to ask questions that will help me to better understand anything I may have difficulty with. I would say I am able to do a fairly competent job of advocating for myself when the need arises.
1	I feel confident in my ability to get the the information I need to make health decisions.  Any uncertainty I have would come from a lack of confidence in the doctor's abilities or training, and not my own ability to understand and research what I am told.
1	I feel I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I attribute this partially to reading comprehension.
-1	I think I do have the capacity to learn and understand information pertaining to my basic health but sometimes feel I need to pull info from practitioners.  Health professiols will normally help me understand anything I am struggling with but there is an element of self advocacy involved.
1	I feel I am the only person truly responsible for my health. I take great care to be very aware of medical information that applies to me. I will definitely search out more info if I feel the need to clarify anything that's not completely clear. I feel I am completelt competant to learn, understand and retain relevant research.
1	I feel I understand written and verbal communications with medical materials or staff.  If there is something unclear, I feel I can ask for clarification or can find the information I need.
1	"With the internet, having a better understanding of health and well being is possible. To a lesser extent talk radio ads about nutritiol supplement helps some, although ""to sell"" is the goal with the ads, so a grain of salt is needed when processing the information. Access to the internet has helped level the playing field and gives the consumer greater leverage. "
-1	I really don't have problems.  When asking for help with forms, it is sort of an ocd thing (self diagnosed).  I just need to be sure.  I rely a large amount on info from the web.  I fully realize that the source must be reputable.
-1	I feel very much confident that I have the capacity to comprehend basic health information. I rarely have to ask for clarification from my health care providers. There have been a couple times where I was a bit puzzled and I didn't ask for clarification. 
-1	I feel like when I am actually at the doctors office there is pressure from the doctor to end the discussion as quickly as possible so he or she can go see other patients. If I am lacking information I need I usually can find the answers to my questions outside of the doctors office with few problems. Obtaining the information is the hard part, processing and understanding the health information isn't difficult for me.
-1	I feel that I can make decisions regarding my own health to a greater degree than professiols. It is somewhat insulting that I have to go to a dermatologist for acne medication that has never heard of tea tree oil. I have had a doctor tell my mother and myself that nutrition has no impact on hormones or the thyroid gland. I've entirely lost faith in the qualifications of healthcare professiols.
-1	I've encountered doctors and nurses who are helpful and clearly explains my needs. With their help it's easy for me to understand and comprehend information and services.
1	I feel confident that I can understand and be able to ask the follow up questions. I feel lucky that I have a doctor who listens and makes sure I understand what I need to know. He also directs me to other resources if I feel the need for more information. 
-1	Sometimes I do understand things give to me by doctors or anyone else in the medical field.
-1	I feel like I am very well informed and have a high capability to take care of myself. I do a lot of research before going into the doctor, and even pay special attention to what I need to ask doctor if I have concerns.
-1	I feel pretty confident researching my health conditions, evaluating study abstracts, and staying on top of new information. Sometimes I have a hard time talking with health care professiols, though. I think they're used to doing the same thing for everyone with a particular health condition and don't understand how my multiple conditions interact with each other. 
1	I feel like anything I don't understand that's given to me by a doctor or nurse would be easily understood after they explain it to me. If I didn't understand it then I would simply ask and that should be enough.
-1	I believe my capacity for these actions is adequate. Although I feel literate in health-related topics, my history of medical care has not received much of my attention.
-1	I believe that I am confident enough to get through acquiring a health service. I do not have a ton of experience and sometimes the wording gets confusing. I think that usually though I will eventually get through it successfully. I've never had help filing my taxes and that usually goes pretty well.
1	I think I get the information I need but I can't say for certain because I don't know what I don't know.  In general, when I'm visiting with my physician I feel free to ask questions and will often paraphrase what I've been told and repeat it back to the doctor or nurse to make sure I've understood it correctly.
-1	I know I have the capacity to understand and retain most information fed to me by doctors and nurses.  I do ask the questions I need to ask but sometimes they don't have the time to answer them.  If I need more answers, I go look up the questions I have and write down items for my next visit.
1	We live in the internet age so I have all the information. Really, I have the exact same information any doctor on the planet would have. If I don't feel like spending a lot of time looking into a specific issue myself, I have no problem with asking the professiols.
-1	I think I can for the most part. I can understand a problem and the possible solutions and strategies to treat the problem. I feel confident enough to share all of my concerns and ask all appropriate questions about my condition. 
1	I read about medical issues, symptoms, and treatments online or ask family and friends. I look up medical terminology to understand subject matter i do not understand. I also try to look online for answers to better understand medical problems
-1	i think it is very hard to understand most of what they tell you. i can understand the basics to my problems like eat less to loose weight but when they go into more detail and reasoning behind things i get lost.
1	I feel I have enough resources to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I ask questions and talk with my doctor and his staff. I review documentation related to  my condition and insurance. I research online and I review with my family members and friends within the healthcare profession.
-1	I have no problem keeping my medical appointments, however I write a list of things to ask when I meet with my Dr. and I forget to take my list with me. I'm married to a retired RN and she is a big help with my understanding my health care. I'm seeing 5 specialists so it's hard to keep on top of it. It's almost a full time job but easier thanks to the internet.
1	"I depend entirely on myself to research my health conditions and my options because I am ethically and philosophically opposed to the techniques used by ""modern"" medicine. I refuse invasive procedures (surgeries) and medications. Since this puts me in opposition to 99% of the physicians out there, I never visit a doctor and rely on myself to research what types of noninvasive, tural remedies are available to me."
-1	By and large, I understand what's given to me to read or am told by health professiols. Sometimes the reading may have terms or wording I don't understand, but all it takes is asking a simple question to clarify things. I'm confident I understand everything by the time I'm done.
1	I feel like I can understand basic information because I try to ask as many questions as possible. I am a very anxious and paranoid person, so if I don't ask questions I'll regret it later and have to call or go back to get them answered. I'd rather look a little ignorant  by making someone reiterate something to me, then be completely in the dark. 
1	While I don't know much about medical or health related information, I am generally a smart person. I can figure most things out myself with a little research. If there is something that I don't understand, I have family who I can ask to help me out.
1	I feel that I am fully capable of making health decisions for myself. My intellectual ability has never been lessened by a health concerned.
-1	I believe I'm presented with everything I need about my health informatiob. When my doctor leaves out I normally have a nurse come in behind to make sure I understood everything about my visit
-1	I feel that I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions because my doctors/healthcare providers generally give me the information I need, and if they don't give me the information up front, I can ask questions and they will answer them. If I have questions about my medication or other issues, I can call my doctor's office to get information regarding that. I also have friends and family that can help answer questions about certain health issues.
1	I think I have a good grasp on everything I am told in my doctor visits and any other visits to a healthcare professiol. If I have any problems with reading information that I'm given, I feel confident that I can ask the doctor or other professiol and they will give me a good explation. I also do a lot of reading and research on my own about medical conditions I have and what I can expect in the future due to these medical conditions. I do reading and research online and I also ask people I know who have the same medical condition(s) as me about their experiences. Using all this information, I feel really good about the questions I need to ask my doctor or areas where I need further explation and information. All of this also makes me feel confident about any decisions I need to make about treatment options. 
-1	Every doctor or nurse I've been to has always explained things to me without me asking them.
-1	i know when i feel headache and i consult doctor but most of the time i feel difficulties to understand when i feel back pain join pain i took calcium and iron suppliment. i walk daily and also vitmain suppliment.
-1	I'm involved in my healthcare and value having a doctor that communicates well. I've switched doctors in the past when I felt a disconnect with them. I generally understand what is going on; advanced medical specifics can be confusing. I aprpreciate having detailed explaitions written down, for my perusal when I'm not as stressed (if applicable).
-1	I think I ask a moderate amount of questions to clarify most of the information given to me by professiols, which I think is the whole key no matter what my mental capacity - you ask until they dumb it down for you to a more comfortable level.
-1	It seems that most medical professiols are really good at explaining things simply right from the start. At times, I really wish they would be more detailed but most are too rushed. In the few times I get any sort of information in writing, I will save it even after reading it to be sure I have a record. I think most information is pretty straight forward. 
1	I think I have the ability to understand everything.  If there was something I didn't understand, I would ask the medical official for clarification, or seek out answers from friends or the internet.
1	I think that I am quite knowledgeable and proficient in understanding and processing healthcare information. I know a lot because of taking care of my elderly parents and my wife is a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer.
1	To some extent- whatever I don't understand, I just ask questions. 
-1	I think that I am well able to fend for myself on all the matters regarding my own health from forms to taking informed decisions to an extent. for instance as long as my faculties allow me to do so. 
-1	Because of my age I believe I am able to comprehend the majority of medical and health related information. However, because of my lack of medical knowledge I feel that I do require help in understanding complicated procedures and technical details.
-1	I think that when you are in a position to have face to face time with a doctor or nurse, you are usually not thinking clearly and things go rather quickly and then when you can't think of what you want to ask right that minute they leave and as soon as you are home you start thinking of questions you should have asked. You can alway call and wait for them to get back to you but that always seems like you are bothering them. The internet is usually a good source to do you your own research to get a better understanding of whats going on, assuming you fact check and don't just believe something because some random person said it was true.
-1	I feel I am able to do all those things most or all of the time. I ask the questions necessary to make sure I understand while with a doctor or nurse. I also will research information on my own. I will also occasiolly ask friends who are in the medical profession.
1	I have an excellent understanding of the basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. 
-1	Overall, I feel that I have a pretty good capacity for reading and understanding information in medical settings. I am a bit shy, however, so I have trouble with speaking up and asking all of the questions I should ask. Sometimes more technical information on forms confuses me and I get my husband to help me in that case.  Sometimes I also get him to call the doctor or pharmacist for me with my questions.
-1	I think I am able to obtain, process and understand basis heath information easily as I am in the medical field myself. I feel competent in understanding diagnosis as well as doctors orders. I Usually don't have any issues filling out medical forms. 
-1	I feel very capable of processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. However I struggle with obtaining information from my healthcare providers because I'm often intimidated by them and don't want to look stupid by asking too many questions. Or oftentimes, the provider will rush through our appointment so I feel as if I would be bothering them by any more detailed questions. 
-1	As I get older it is a little bit more difficult to understand certain things when they explain to me.  I usually have to ask twice or three times before I am able to fully understand what they are explaining to me.  Some of the medical terms they use are words I have never heard before in my life, so this is why I can get confused at times. 
1	I feel as though I could get the information that I need and process it to a great degree. I tend to bring notebooks with me to the doctor to write down questions I have and what is said to reference in the future.
1	without understanding i can spoil my health mor so first of all understand the problem well then correct  treatment
1	If the issues that I have are basic I feel that I will have more than enough capacity to understand and obtain the information needed to make the correct decision(s) for my benefit. If the issue is something of higher significance I may than need more assistance. 
-1	I am very confident that I the ability to obtain proper medical and health decisions. If something isn't clear, I can always ask and find the information I need. I feel confident in my doctor to give me all the information I need.
-1	I believe I'm very capable of understanding most medical information. I feel with the doctors I have had explain much of what is going on with me in plain english. However when I have had doctors in the hospital particularly that were very unhelpful and didn't speak in plain english. So i find the more of the emergency i have been in the harder it has been to make a the high decisions I have to be very trusting. 
-1	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information. I have not had an experience where I did not understand most of the information given to me. I also am in college and planning on going into the medical field, so I would like to say that I should know more than the average person that takes this survey.
1	I think I am fully capable of reading and understanding instructions provided. I may forget to ask a question or two, but I'm confident I could find the answers or contact someone. I am confident in filling out forms and talking to a provider.
1	I feel that I am perfectly capable of understanding most basic health information. But sometimes things can be a little convoluted or confusing and you want someone there with you who can confirm what you heard and understood it the same way that you did. It is also stressful when you are dealing with a health condition and you might miss something while you are worrying and thinking about your health, so it's helpful to have someone along with you to get any information that you might miss.
-1	I feel that overall I do OK. I do a lot of research on my own and try to prepare for appointments in advance. If I don't feel a doctor is helpful and really listens to me, I will switch to someone else. 
-1	I due tend to understand most medical information, and info presented to me, if I dont I can find a way to figure it out.
1	I think that I am able to understand the instructions fairly well. If I have any questions I ask my doctor directly or I follow up with the office after I leave.
-1	I am very confident in getting all the information that is needed. The reason is very simple I do not trust anyone or anything. By having that believe I always make sure  thing goes smoothly.
-1	I have the capacity to obtain and process but the problem is, in my opinion, that there are so many conflicting claims about treatment, about the quality and efficacy of medication, and then loss in meaning when dealing with doctors/nurses who don't speak your language as a first language, that getting through the health care system these days is almost an active minefield.  Or a crapshoot.
1	I'm not in the medical profession, so I can honestly say that I do need to have some medical information explained to me. I do believe that I'm capable of looking up information about a treatment, diagnosis or medication. I do ask a lot of questions to people providing medical care to make sure I fully understand what is happening and how the treatment options affect me persolly.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to understand a good amount of what doctors or nurses are telling me because I work in the medical field. If I did not, I think it would be much more confusing as a patient,
1	I believe that I can understand basic health information well enough to be able to make appropriate decisions.  I believe this because I have the ability to comprehend what the health professiols are telling me, and if I have questions I will ask them to obtain the answer.
-1	It all depends on the wording. If it is placed in simple english then it is easily understood if they attempt to use many weird medical terms then it is different
-1	I have a university education so I'm not too concerned about not being able to process or understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. With ease of access to information online through a smartphone and being open with medical assistants and practitioners, I believe I am able to understand everything being presented to me. Excessive legalese or use of scientific mes/terminology may give me pause, but I am confident I will be able to find a means of getting layman's definitions for them or convince medical personnel to simplify anything that I might find confusing.
-1	I feel that I have superior capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. I tend to do my own research before making decisions, sometimes compiling positives and negatives and balancing them to make the most optimal decision.
1	I feel like I can understand most of what is told to me; I also act as another set of ears for my fiance, who has had a number of health issues lately. I make sure to ask questions on anything that we're not completely clear on, and know when to get clarification when needed.
-1	I am perfectly capable in obtaining, understanding and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have never needed any help when dealing with these issues.
-1	It would help with making sure that it would have a lot of health info, while people are able to have good decisions
-1	I make sure I am explained in layman's terms anything I should know about any conditions or symptoms or medicines I need. When I leave the office I am confident I understand throughly and am able to make informed decisions. 
1	From the various tests I've taken in my life I've been judged to be in the upper levels of intelligence. I'm aware of nothing in my experience which do not support those results. Overall, my reading and understanding of English and the ability to comprehend all types of information is more than adequate. 
1	I think I have all of the resources needed to make appropriate health decisions. First off I have a great doctor who is more then willing to answer all questions that I have and he explains information well. I also have the internet of course including some resources there that my doctor has recommended. Overall I have had very few problems and when I do my questions are usually answered satisfactorily. 
1	I am responsible for my own medical appointments and decisions.  I have learned to be self sufficient in that regard and learn the necessary steps to take care of myself.  I believe I have good health insurance, doctors and a pharmacy that willing to take the time to educate me or answer any questions I have.
1	I have always been proactive regarding my responsibilities as a patient.  A nurse once told me that doctor's don't remember everything so keep them on their toes.
1	I am the son of a doctor so I am very aware of my health needs and how to read documents. I know what is good for myself and my body and I am able to understand how different procedures affect different outcomes and make a ratiol decision based upon the facts. 
1	I believe that I have a large capacity to obtain all the information and understand it, as I am a person that asks questions of the doctor's so that I know what is going on with my health. I also am one to do my own research on medical conditions by going on health websites. 
1	Well, I have the good fortune to be a fluent speaker of English in a largely English-speaking country and, while I am a pretty low-key individual, I am not afraid to ask a question about something I don't understand.  I am not afraid of looking foolish- it is much better to be properly informed.  While I have a bad tendency to not think of a question fast enough while I'm at the doctor's office, my main physician lets me e-mail him and has answered many of my belated questions that way.
-1	I feel pretty confident in my abilities to obtain and process medical information given to me. Occasiolly I will come up with questions after I've already left the office and I'll need to get in contact with them again.. sometimes that causes me anxiety but I can push through it to get the information I need.
-1	I have a good capacity to get the information and services I need.  I have enough insurance coverage to get health services.  I have good doctors who provide me with the information I need.  I can also use the internet to get some information.
1	Completely comfortable with understanding health information and making an informed decision based on it. 
-1	I believe I have a moderate capacity. The issue is that I have a very limited knowledge of many parts of the body and how they should function with one another properly. It's sad to say but it's true. So it can be difficult and I can require extra explaining when something is wrong with me.
1	I used to sell health insurance so I do not have problems filling out the forms. I understand most of the paperwork. When a doctor is talking to me, they sometimes us terminology that I do not understand but I do not have a problem asking them what that means.
-1	Mostly I can figure stuff out, but there are still a lot of questions that go unswered sometimes.  Although they try to explain things to me I still sometimes have a hard time remembering or understanding them.  Doctor information to me is often complicated.
1	I believe that I am quite confident in understanding basic health information and services about my health decisions and other medical conditions that I experience.  I like to do research online and read articles, if not even medical jourls about specific conditions that I experience, or at high-risk for.
-1	There is nothing that prevents me from understanding basic health information. I have enough experience with the medical system that I can understand the common terms used in writing and expressed by my doctor.
1	I feel confident enough to make health decisions.  I have been hospitalized numerous times for Crohn's Disease and partial bowel obstructions along with several surgeries to make me comfortable enough to understand what the health providers have told me.  I also do a lot of research online to understand my conditions and what will happen and what kind of treatment regimen I will take along with the post hospitalization recovery period.
-1	I think that I understand and am capable of understanding most of what a doctor or nurse is explaining and if I don't I can ask them to go a little more detail. I feel comfortable asking about things that I'm not quite certain about without feeling dumb.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain and process basic information from my doctors. I generally feel like most doctors want their patients to understand what is happening and they speak in a way that things are clear and when they don't I don't mind letting them know.
-1	I feel that I have had enough experience and education to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services I need to make decisions. I have had college courses in biology and health, I have some familiarity with Latin and Greek, and I regularly read science jourls to keep up with discoveries and developments in health sciences.
-1	I have to ask questions again if I do not understand.I often have a family member come with me so I do not miss anything.
1	Well I'd rather know than not know so I'm not afraid of asking hard questions and will press if I'm not getting answers that I fully trust or think they might be holding back.  I also think I'm quite capable of understanding my options when explained to me properly as well as of course being able to research my options myself.  All in all I feel quite capable that most of the time I can make good decisions about my health.
1	I am highly capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a strong educatiol background in health and medicine so I understand what I need and expectations for the services should receive. 
-1	I don't have any trouble understanding materials that are given to me regarding healthcare, but I don't always read everything. I'll read the parts I think are most important. Face-to-face communication with any healthcare provider is difficult because they are usually in a hurry. If I have questions I know I'll want to ask, I'll write them down ahead of time, but there's not time during appointments to discuss anything.
1	I think I have a good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a problem understanding my doctors or forms before. I do not think I need help with this.
-1	i feel fairly confident, most persol information is straight forward. Most questions can be asked and understood in the office and i can always do some research on the internet.
1	I have no mental problems that prevent me from understanding the written or spoken word.  I am nearly completely deaf, but my doc speaks louder and it is not hard to hear him.  And if I do not understand something he or the nurse says, I ask them to repeat themselves.  Same goes with any form I am filling out.  If I do not understand the question, I ask.  So, I would say I have 100% capacity to understand information, get information, process said information and make the necessary medical decisions.
-1	I feel I have the skills required to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I have proficiency reading and writing in English, which all of my health information is presented in.  I work in the sciences, which helps me to understand more complex terminology as well as have the ability to look up what I don't understand.  I ask for help when needed, and am always open with my doctors even if it is about questioble or embarrassing issues. 
-1	I believe that I can understand health information better when told in person rather than reading a pamphlet or brochure. This also offers the opportunity to ask questions so that I'm sure to understand something I may have initially missed. 
-1	I feel I'm able to follow and comprehend medical information farely well. Especially, since you can research much of the information online.  I'm pretty good at doing my due diligence.  
1	Im typically a detail and fine print person so I always read information thoroughly and if I have a question I ask and build on it if it doesn't make sense to me. An example would be when I had 5 disk fusion surgery on my neck. The Surgeon had given me some pamplets to read that were essentially percentages of improvement. I may have a 20 percent full recovery or 12 percent full use of my right arm or 8 percent no change at all. The percentages made little sense since none left me with a 50 / 50 chance of improvement and I had to ask more questions as to whether this expensive surgery had any upside at all.
-1	I feel sort of confident to be able to process the information that I am given by the doctors. I do wish that I had a better way to understand the results  of the blood work and xr and mris.
1	I believe that I am fully capable of understanding most health information that is given to me by any health professiol. I have the means to research things at home. If I don't understand anything, especially certain terms that I have not heard before, I make sure to ask my doctor exactly what that means.
-1	I am fully capable of understanding and processing basic and even advanced health information but sometimes I may need things to be explained fully to understand certain points.
-1	For most basic issues, I feel very confident.  However, my experience helping my mother sort through terminology and different specialists for pancreatic cancer taught me that there are definitely areas that I struggle to understand.  Often the shock of whatever was just told to you shrouds your ability to even realize you're not understanding.
1	I feel confident that I can understand what is being explained to me.  However, if there is something I don't understand, I ask them to explain it further.
1	I have complete control over understand what is said or written to me. If I need help, then I ask. But that is rare.
-1	Now most providers have online services so I have message them about anything and ask questions 24 hours a day, its all secure with quick replies too so this makes things easy for me. Anything more complicated I can call or visit my provider, usually get a callback same day and an appointment within 48 hours. Health related things are a lot more efficient and accessible than even just 5 years ago.
-1	Yes I feel that I do. I have dealt with hospitals and medical things quite a bit due to my children.
1	I feel like I am pretty informed and do ask questions about health care options. There are times that my doctor is uble or unwilling to address certain questions (i.e. supplements versus prescription meds; treatment side effects, etc.) and questions go unswered.  But I generally understand information I am given or I am able to find competent online sources to read further and understand.
1	I feel confident answering questions freely. When I ask enough questions I feel more trusting of the doctor or nurse. I also feel capable that if I felt unsure I could seek out other sources to come back to the doctor and further the discussion.
-1	I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions. Regarding forms, I sometimes have difficulty remembering family history and accurately describing symptoms but I try my best. Regarding doctors/medical professiols, I try to prepare questions in advance and ask for explations for anything I don't understand. Generally the most difficult part is getting the doctor to answer some basic questions before rushing out. I don't think they're rude, just definitely in a hurry. If there's still things I don't understand, I'll use google or call and talk to a nurse. I might not fully understand everything, but I trust my capacity to make appropriate medical decisions.
1	Yes I am quite confident that I can ask the right questions plus plenty more they probably don't want me to ask. My knowledge comes from many years of using tural methods of healing over traditiol methods.
-1	I think I have the ability to obtain a lot of information on the internet.  I can't obtain information from other people as much as from the internet because I'm not around people much especially medical people and because it's very difficult for me to think of everything if I'm talking to someone so sometimes I don't end up asking anything and sometimes I only ask one or two things that I've already thought a lot about.  I think I can usually understand information on the internet, though I think sometimes both the internet and doctors and nurses don't give much information because they don't think I need to know much.
-1	I feel like I know my health. I ask what I need in order to understand. I feel adequate enough to explain any problems or deficiencies that I may have.
1	I can understand the materials that are given to me by a  doctor and I fully understand what they tell me about any problems that I may have. If I don't understand something, I always ask the doctor to explain it to me. Any forms that I need to fill out I can usually fill them out all by myself without any help. If I have a question about a field to fill out on a form I will ask the receptionist about it. I will then fill out the form completely. I don't make any decisions without knowing the consequences of those decisions first.I always ask the doctor of my options, so I can fully understand what I need to do.
-1	i feel that i am very capable to make my own health decisions. i only have a difficult time when the paperwork gets into legal matters. that's when it gets a little confusing for me. i am quite knowledgeable about medical terminology and procedures. but if i have a question i always ask and if i feel that i need a second opnion i will go and get it.
1	It's easy for me because I'm obsessed with health and fitness (tural bodybuilder since the age of 16). I have no illnesses and pretty much never get sick, so I seldom have anything to process. When the occasion does arise, my tural interest and passion for health causes me to exert more effort to understand and assimilate the information, that's a large part of why it comes easily.
-1	I believe I am knowledgeable enough to understand most basic information. However, I do tend to ask a lot of questions just to make sure I get everything right. Especially when it comes to your health, it is always good to get more information and clarification. 
-1	I have full capacity to process, understand and obtain basic health information and services. I do a lot of reading and research and am comfortable learning and processing information.
1	I think I do pretty good in all those areas of health decision making, with one exception. When I am not feeling well, I do sometimes ask for help in understanding the health communications from my doctors and nurses. This was an issue two years ago when I had a fall and a concussion. So I got a lot of healthcare information then, but I was suffering from concussion which made the understanding difficult by myself. Then I had to get help.
-1	well fortutely there is the internet,and i can search for more information about the things i dont know enough about.without that i doubt i could find the info easily.
1	I am a fluent English writer and speaker and I can read very well.  I am very aware of what the Doctor or Nurse is telling me and I clearly understand what they are saying. 
1	I feel like I am well prepared for interactions with health professiols. I can understand most that is to,d to me, and I am not afraid to ask questions or request clarification regarding the items I don't fully comprehend. 
1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Occaisiolly if there is language or benefits that are worded in a confusing manner I can call my benefit provider for clarification. 
1	I listen to the doctor, I sometimes take notes. I ask if I have any questions before they leave the room
-1	I feel I have adequate ability to understand basic health information and services in regards to using it to make intelligent health decisions. My introverted ture makes face-to-face conversations awkward and I tend to avoid them. But I am usually offered ample written material that I can read on my own.
1	I have an understanding of my medical problems, so I feel that what the doctors recommend, I am able to make a decision.  If there is an option that I am not aware of, I will have the doctor explain it to me.
1	I am very confident about my abilities to read and understand health information. Sometimes I may need help to understand some of the medical jargon used but overall I can do it by myself.
-1	I feel I have a basic understanding of health information that is provided to me by my doctor.  If I am confused by information I will look it up on the Internet for clarification. I believe with my knowledge and the Internet I came make informed decisions. 
1	I feel pretty confident in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I believe I have a pretty good idea of how to keep myself fit and healthy. If I have any questions for my doctor, I'll ask them. I'm always careful to follow my doctor's advice/orders very carefully. 
-1	It takes me some effort to get a grasp of medical information provided by my doctors. Some of it is quite confusing. So, I have to trust them blindly without my informed input in the medical decision they make.
1	I think my ability to understand is good and I also have the ability to research answers from places like Mayo Clinic online.  But sometimes I do find it hard to talk to doctors and hard to be able to assess if they understood 'me' as opposed to me understanding them.  I think I'm capable of making appropriate health decisions.
-1	I can do as well as the next person i think But when they start talking to fast it can go over my head. I feel I am smart enough to understand most subjects and health care is no different.
-1	I feel that I have a good grasp of the terminology often used, and if I don't I feel confident enough to ask questions of my doctor or to search for the definitions of the terminology on the internet.
-1	I feel like a normal capacity to understand and absorb basic health questions, if I needed to make an appropriate decision.
1	I think I clearly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I am quite intelligence and have never had a problem understanding health information and if I din't, I knew where to find the information to explain it.
-1	I feel that I have enough knowledge to understand basic health information.  I am able to review and understand all the information that is given to me by healthcare professiols.
1	I feel that I'm pretty good at understanding health information and for the few instances where I'm not completely sure, I ask the doctor questions. So I think that I have a really firm grasp of what I need to know to make a good health decision.
-1	In my opinion, I have a high degree of capacity to obtain and coherently process my health information. I've thus far accurately understood my treatment plans and executed effective decisions that have had great outcomes.
1	I feel quite confident in being able to understand basic health services and information. If there is anything I'm unsure about I ask my doctor. If it's after I've left the doctor's office, the internet can be a helpful tool in better understand certain services or diagnosis.
-1	I don't need accommodations or help to obtain or process basic health information. However, when I need some specific information usually I find it difficult to obtain it.  Medical pamphlets are general and vague, doctors and nurses are busy.
-1	I feel that I do have the capacity to process and understand the information needed on my health issues. My concerns are that the health care professiols are not providing me the true information that I need to get the proper treatment. 
1	I am a fully confident in my ability to understand basic health information. I can rely on online resources like Google to help me obtain the information I am interested in.
-1	YES BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ARE UNDERSTAND 
-1	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand my health information by speaking with my doctors and their office assistants, including visits to specialists and labs. Details I may want to investigate are very often found online.  But when it comes to the fincial aspect of healthcare and health insurance I have often been confused and intimidated. The past several years have been much better with the help of the ACA and Covered California; but I am extremely worried that Republican legislation will end all that and allow insurance companies to focus on their profits instead of getting healthcare to those that need it.
-1	When I have to make important decisions or feel a little uneasy, I make sure I bring someone with me to help. So if I don't fully understand they can help me.I have no problem asking if I do not understand something.
1	"I have the capability to do all of the above.  The problem comes in understanding the always changing process, being told one thing by one nurse/doctor and being told something else by another.  Sometimes the information presented to read and understand at times reads like its meant for professiols in the field, not the non-medical educated.  I do a lot of asking when big medical words are used ""what does that mean"".  Sometimes I feel like I'm just supposed to understand and process what they want me to!  My health is good enough and I'm educated enough to understand most, but people like my mom have no clue and just go on whatever doctors want to do and trust."

1	I'm fairly confident that I have the capacity to understand basic health information. Sometimes I get anxiety when trying to talk to health professiols so I may not ask everything I want to or clearly explain things.
1	I feel that I have a high capacity to understand my basic health information.  Unfortutely, I have had a chronic illness for many years so I have learned a lot about basic health information.
-1	I believe that i have access to any type of resource that i need in order to obtain information to make medical decisions. There are a lot of ways  can go about this such as asking a loved one, asking a pharmacist, asking the doctor, or calling in to the doctors office and speaking to a nurse. 
1	I like to read about medical issues so I am used to the medical terms. I don't need any help.
-1	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand health information most of the time, but require assistance if things are overly technical. I have no problem in asking the nurses or doctors to explain information until I understand, and I often go online after an appointment to read-up further on my options. I feel that I have all the tools I need to make appropriate health decisions. 
1	I feel fairly confident that when I see medical professiols, I am getting the information I need specific to my situation. If there are areas I am unclear on, I try to ask questions to help myself understand. Thankfully I have the ability to contact them after the fact if there is something I didn't have fully explained while at an appointment.
-1	I believe that i have enough understanding of health information to make a judgement or decision concerning my health. If i do mot understand something i will either look it up, or ask questions about it
1	I am only 30 so I am capable of reading and doing research on the internet of people with similar problems. I also am able to view the different literature and opinions to find the appropriate health decisions.
1	With the internet, I have so much access to information that I feel like I could always find a source that made sense to me.  If one trusted website is a little over my head, I'm sure I could find another that made more sense to me.
-1	I ask anything I do not understand. My doctors and nurses are informative and helpful.
-1	I think I can process the information fairly well, I'm not a doctor but I do like to know the medication I'm receiving and I will do research about it online.
-1	I believe that I have a great deal of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as I have learned a lot from my wife(she is a nurse), I always ask questions from the health provider if I don't understand something. I also have the internet to find out the meaning of something.
1	I am perfectly capable of researching my own health conditions and being fully prepared to deal with them with a doctors help. I have questioned my doctors diagnoses before based on my own research. And it turns out I was correct. 
1	I can do everything I need to make health decisions. I understand documents,treatment plans, etc very easily. And if I don't I know what questions to ask and what research I can do on my own.
1	I feel I have the adequate knowledge to understand what the doctors//nurses tell me. If I do not understand something, I have them elaborate more on it, so I do understand. Otherwise, I am pretty good at understanding the medical reports given to me.
1	I am able to understand my condition because if I have any questions, I will ask them. I will look to a doctor's treatment plan as a recommendation but not as the only option. Once diagnosed with something, I will research the condition on my own and see all of the alternatives. I will search for cases very similar to my own and look for information about how others treated this condition most successfully. I will not just follow what a doctor says without researching for myself. 
-1	I feel capable
1	I have the capacity to listen carefully and to try my best to interpret what the information means to me personally. If I do not understand I will ask to have it explained in more detail. I also am in touch with reality and what is or is not possible as far as medical treatment. In other words I tend to keep unrealistic expectations in check.
1	I feel that I can read basic health information just as long as it doesn't involve very technical terms that a normal person wouldn't understand.
-1	I am a person that tends to read a lot about health issues. Not only do I talk to octors but I also o my own research that way I can understand at least the basics when it comes to meical terms. That way I can make better decisions.
1	Overall I feel pretty confident. However, sometimes I don't think of the best questions to ask the healthcare professional while I am meeting with them. Sometimes I dont' think of the best questions until after I have already left.
1	I'm experienced enough that I've accumulated significant knowledge already. I can always access my health providers website or ask my doctor if I have questions. There are also thousands of websites providing an abundance of information. I have watched many hours of medical television and have become familiar with medical terminology.
1	I think I'm capable of understanding what my doctor says, reading provided information, and asking followup questions as needed. I'm also capable of doing internet research and asking my doctor questions about the relevance of what I found. Overall I feel I'm able to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I think I can do this very well. I have done it in the past to great success. I think if I had any trouble grasping it, I could get clarification from a professional or online myself. It wouldn't be too hard to get obtain, process, and understand basic health info. 
-1	I think a have a good capacity to understand what health informations, I always ask my doctors to explain everything I want to know and I also do research.
1	I know how to find the answers to my questions if I have any via web, medical professionals and friends. 
1	At or above the level that a non medical professional can.
-1	I have all or most of the necessary abilities in terms of being able to understand what's being communicated to me. However, my issue is more that, sometimes, I do not seek medical advice because I have other priorities. Alternatively, I really value my privacy and might feel like I do not want others telling me how to act, regardless of their expertise. 
1	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do so. I can easily read and understand most medical literature and I know what information to seek out and what questions to ask. I also feel confident about my ability to conduct independent research online or anywhere else.
1	I am willing to do whatever research is necessary to make sure I fully understand the situation. I fell that when I make a decision it is based on the best information available. 
1	I for the most part understand the basic health information that is presented to me. And i am also confident in making a executive decision towards my health. 
1	I'm very confident. I worked as a surgical tech for 10 years and have a degree in biology so I'm well versed in medical research and how to understand it and comfortable with medical terminology.
1	I don't really have issues with this. I have relatives who work in the healthcare field so if I do have questions, I just ask them. I am confident filling out forms and almost never have to ask for help.
1	I feel very capable of locating any health-related information I desire. I have been using the internet since the mid-1980s (yes, it did exist at that time but was mostly available only to certain companies, government agencies and universities) so I have a lot of experience with it. I am also VERY willing to rely on my own research to question my doctor's advice or even disregard it in favor of something that I think makes more sense.
1	I am positive I have the capacity to understand and process basic health information and even beyond that to make appropriate health decisions. I am a registered nurse working towards my master's and am confident I understand what my doctor tells me 100% of the time.
1	I think I have access through friends, the internet, and acquaintances in the medical field, to get help understanding most situations I might encounter. I think that while some of this information might not be totally accurate it may give me some more context when seeking medical information.
-1	I feel I have quite a capacity. Ultimately, no matter how professionally trained a doctor is, your health is your own responsibility and no one will care about it as much as you. Given this motivation, it isn't hard to believe that I would do the requisite research. 
1	I feel extremely capable of understanding basic health information because I have done a lot of research throughout my life about various health issues so most of the information is not foreign to me. They are things that I already have a small amount of knowledge on.
-1	I think that I have a good ability to do this. Both me and my wife are very good at doing research online. We are also very open and up front about asking questions and being very thorough. By using all of these traits and skill I feel that I am very equiped to get all the info I need to make health decisions.
1	I know and am confident I can understand everything health related; if there is something I do not understand, I have no problem asking a health professional to explain it to me
1	I think I have the intelligence to handle any medical terms. I'm also good at researching, so anything I don't understand I will look up. I don't hesitate to ask questions. I will also get a second opinion on whatever my GP tells me from a close friend who is a doctor in another state. I will also question him about anything I'm not clear about.
-1	If I am interested in a not very serious illness then I look for information in the internet, but I always seek advice from the doctor is the condition is somewhat more serious.
1	The internet is a big factor in staying informed. People tend to overestimate a doctor's knowledge. Much information can be found on the internet about basic medical info.
1	Im well educated and smarter than the average bear.  Im also willing to ask for clarification (or do my own research) if something is unclear.
1	I feel like I am fully capable of making appropriate health decisions. 
1	I have a good understanding of my health conditions and will research anything I need additional information on.
1	I have been in situations where I needed to find out as much info as possible and I did. I have also been the person that was needed to get the info for someone else, so I know that I will ask about anything I am not sure of and that I can research and question the Dr's based on that research. 
1	I have lots of resources to understand the health information I need. I simply ask my medical providers questions and they tend to answer them in depth. I tend to do research on the internet before a doctor's visit and I write down my question in advance. I also signed up to have access to my medical records/lab results online. I have researched my lab results (numbers) to get a better understanding of my health.
1	I feel that my capacity/ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information/services to make appropriate health decisions is more than sufficient. I have no problem digesting even relatively complex information about health issues, symptoms, treatment. If I have any questions about information, I have no problem whatsoever communicating with the relevant health care provider in order to obtain any needed clarification. I am also rather vigilant about communicating any questions or concerns I may have when I don't understand information being relayed to me by a provider, as well as when informing them about my own issues or various respective symptoms. I don't know what else to say. The process is pretty clear to me & in the odd exception that it's not, the process of how to obtain clarification is clear. 
1	I feel like I could understand and process any basic health information to make appropriate decisions involving my health. If for some reason I couldn't initially understand I am confident I can find resources or help that would enable me to properly understand health information and services. On some issues I would probably know more than any medical personnel I talk to.
-1	I have the internet. It can help me understand anything. 
-1	I feel like I am very capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information.

1	I think I have enough of a knowledge base to make informed opinions about my condition after doing some research and consulting with my doctor. If I have questions when my doctor is explaining something I make sure to ask them. I usually do my own research and ask the doctor what they think about my conclusions. 
-1	I feel like I have an above average capacity to understand basic health information but I need help occasionally with prescriptions. Lymphoma is more complicated than a google search, so I have to ask my doctor how to deal with it.
-1	I started to get my own medical records because I wasn't getting all of the information that they were writing about me. So it helped me understand what they were thinking of me, and what I needed to do to get them to understand. I do have to google a lot of the wording on copies of MRIs because no one really tells me what came up on the scans.
1	I studied Medical Office Technology in college which included classes in medical terminology. I had to learn a lot about different medical procedures and afflictions. I've always read about my level, and I read rather fast. I know I can understand what I read. If I can't, I know how to get online and look up what I need. I also know a few medical personnel I can call and ask to explain something to me.
-1	I think I can process basic health information for basic health decisions. But more complicated stuff probably not, I'd just have to trust whatever the doctor said. 
-1	i use the internet to find out more info about hat a doctor has told me. i usually think of questions i leave. 
-1	I feel that I have a medium capacity to obtain, understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel comfortable with my basic medical knowledge and problem solving skills to make the correct health decisions on my own.
1	Well, if anything is confusing to me, I can just ask a doctor or a nurse. I can also use the vast internet to find answers to my questions as well as find people online to discuss medical issues/decisions that I might be faced with -- people who face the same things. I can seek advice from those people. For the most part, I am confident I can and do understand information relevant to my health.

1	I feel completely confident.  I'm reasonably smart and understand some of how the world works.
-1	I think I am pretty capable of understanding basic health information. There are many resources online that can help clear up and misconceptions with medical terminology.
1	I feel I have a good ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information so I can make health decisions. I have never run into a problem at my doctor's office or medical facility where I was confused about any particular thing.
-1	I think I have a pretty good capacity to do this. I'm competent and can research things I'm not familiar with. 
1	I understand most and if I don't, I will google it and look up information to be sure I get all in the information i need and want and make sure I understand it all.  I will always research any kind of medical issue I may have and will question my dr. if my research and their opinions differ.  I want to be sure I get the best medical care I can with all the information I can gather about medical/health issues.
1	I feel that I am informed enough, and I feel in tune with how I feel with my body. I am always asking questions If I feel I don't understand something, or want to know more about a respective issue. I feel certain I can care for myself.
1	I'm fully competent in deciding what is best for me pertaining to my health 
1	I think I'm educated and knowledgeable enough to understand the health information given to me generally. I'm health conscious, exercise and take supplements which I look into. I think my knowledge through experience and that I've picked up through life is sufficient.
-1	I have everything ready available for me online. I do also have  my doctor on had close to me to help me understand information.
1	I have good ability
1	I am mentally capable. I research more than the average person on medical care and medications.
1	I have access to the internet and can look up information. I can ask doctors for a second opinion. I am very skeptical and cautious in general. I also believe that having a medical degree doesn't automatically make you any more intelligent than the average person and certainly doesn't make you the alpha and omega of medical knowledge. Like in all fields and occupations, there are mediocre people.
-1	I think I can obtain the most extensive information from my personal doctor. I fully trust him because he has been my doctor for my entire life. 
1	I think I can make appropriate health decisions because I'm always willing to ask questions and if I don't personally agree with a treatment option, I challenge it or get a second opinion. It's my health, and I have the right to ensure I'm getting the best possible care. 
-1	I would consider so important information and some people advice 
1	I have no problem understand what my doctor tells me. But he like pills, and i don't so we disagree but I still take what he tells me to
1	The internet is my main source of health information and tracking as I do not really have reliable health care. I feel I'm fairly lucky with my health, all things considered
1	Health topics are something I research all the time on the internet. If it is something that directly affects me, I have a tendency to do a lot of research on the internet about the subject. I will consider alternative medical treatments along with what the medical establishment recommends.
-1	I think I have a better ability than most to learn about my illnesses. I have been chronically ill with several rare diseases for years now and I tend to have to look up medical studies on my own time to get more knowledge about how to help myself heal. 
-1	I feel like as long I knew the definition of basic medical terminology than I would be able to understand somewhat. It would provide a good foundation of comprehension.
1	I eel that I am very well capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information. Perhaps it's a mix of my intelligence and the knowledge I already have mixed with having good luck in the information being explained to me in an easy way. 
-1	While I am reasonably confident in my abilities to understand, there are times when doctors and health care professionals speak with too much complicated jargon. It is helpful to have someone with me to ask the questions that I don't even know I should be asking.
-1	I can make basic decisions on my own. However, it is good to get reassurance from the nurse and doctors. Basically being able to use common sense is how I would approach it. 
1	I feel that all of the forms that you have to fill out are pretty self-descriptive. I've never had any kind of problems understanding anything - they almost over explain things on the forms so you know exactly what you are getting into or what you are diagnosed with.
-1	I believe I understand most things, sometimes I get frustrated when filling out forms regarding insurance information because I don't fully understand that sort of thing.
-1	I think I'm okay at it. I am sometimes quite distracted because children come with me to several appointments and my main focus is usually on them. Beyond that, I'm confident enough to ask questions to make sure I understand things. 
-1	I believe I have perfect capacity to obtain basic health information and services that I need to make decisions.  I am a literate person that is not shy about asking questions.
1	I know that I can ask questions of my health care provider and that they will answer me. If I am unsure if something I will ask them to clRify. I also know the terminology in medical papers enough to understand what I am agreeing to. I am in control but I must ask the questions.
-1	My parents raised me to understand things that I read. I am very educated and I can learn to do things on my own without other peoples help.
1	I feel like I have all the tools for my basic health information. I can call to obtain, and I can also go online and access a lot of my medical information. I think it's so easy to access this information.
-1	I feel I am still young and healthy, and my health problems are not yet complicated or severe that would be hard to understand. I am also very smart even though im not overly familiar with medical topics so that helps 
-1	I feel I have the capacity to understand and retain most basic health information. It is harder to retain services as I live in America where health is expensive and hard for anyone that is not rich.
-1	"I would give myself a ""B+"".  I understand just about everything, but when they start using very medicals terms / lingo I may start to not understand as well.  Sometimes I do not like to ask because I think it may make me look stupid, but I should not care because it is my health we are discussing."
-1	I feel like with the terms and complicated medical lingo, I am not exactly sure what some of the meanings entail. Such as If I am diagnosed with a certain condition and need medication X, I don't know what that medication does, what the alternatives are, I don't even know how to pronounce some of these names. I feel like I am able to ask the doctors but can not fully grasp the magnitude of the situation without looking at the whole picture which is difficult to have someone explain to me in one visit. I feel like I need  a step by step diagnostic, of why this happened, what I can do, what the consequences are, what some definitions of the disease are, etc. 
1	"I've been with my doctor for about 10 years and I trust him completely. I feel very open and honest with him. I tell him everything and do not fear judgment when I ask a ""stupid"" question."
1	I've never felt like it's been a problem. I haven't had a lot of issues filling out paperwork for various things, but I haven't needed to all that often (knock on wood). When I did, it was pretty straightforward. I'd leave things blank if I had to.
1	The doctor I visit is clear in anything he tells me. Any questions about medications or symptoms are answered in a way that I can understand.  I have not run in to a situation where left the office being confused about something.
-1	I believe that I have the capabilities to make health decisions for many reasons. First off, the internet is so big today and full of information that anybody can go there to get valuable information on any topic.
-1	I think that I have the capacity to understand health information and services. The doctors I see are helpful and informative, and so are their staff members. I usually find health information pretty clear and easy to understand, but if I do need help, I know there is someone I can go to.
1	I'm completely able to make appropriate health decisions for myself and for family members when necessary.  I have no problem asking questions when I don't understand something, and I'm capable of doing my own research if I feel like I want more information.
1	I feel like I am able to understand everything that I need in order to make informed decisions about my health and whatever choices or options I need to make related to them. I don't require assistance from others to understand.
1	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on understanding the various aspects of healthcare. I make sure to read materials thoroughly and, like with contracts, I always make sure to read fine print and ask questions about things I do not understand. The internet allows me to do basic research on things I might need to ask or clarify. I trust my doctors to provide me with the proper information and I trust them to explain things to me in terms that I can understand.
-1	I think I can easily fill out the health forms but it's difficult finding a doctor that is covered by insurance and affordable to get the answers needed, so I always feel like I am doing the bare minimum to maintain rather than actually getting help.
1	I feel like a have a high degree ob ability to obtain and understand the necessary information. Occasionally my memory and reading comprehension will be much lower than average, and I require some help to get through things.
1	I feel very comfortable when dealing with my own medical concerns and obtaining the correct information. I have studied Exercise Science in college and spent a lot of my time during college going to the doctors on my own so I learned quickly what was expected of me and of the doctors to make sure I understood everything and took care of my health properly.
-1	I feel like I have the capacity to understand basic health information. There are times when doctors may use terms, medications, procedures, etc. that I don't understand, but I always ask them to please explain. 
-1	I think as long as someone is good at explaining it I can usually comprehend most of it. I guess I t would depend on what was being discussed
1	Well, I have the internet available as a tool if I find myself in any confusion regarding a diagnosis, medicine dosage, symptoms, side-effects, etc.  My sister-in-law is in the medical field as well, and can explain things.
1	I think I am able to get all of the information that I need, although sometimes I can not think of what to ask until after the fact. Also at times, I may not completely understand what the doctor or nurse is saying, but I trust their diagnosis and directions for the most part. 
-1	I feel completely sure of being able to carry out a success with these approaches, without a doubt I can do it with all certainty
-1	Throughout my life I have had to deal with medical professionals due to two auto-immune disorders that I have had since childhood. Therefore, I feel as if I am able to understand medical documents and explanations better than some . 
1	I've been in and out of hospitals my entire life, having numerous medical conditions since I was young. I've been filling out and reading medical forms ever since I was able to do so (around 16 or 17, I believe) If I ever don't understand something, I simply ask until I do.
-1	When it comes to just myself I am confident that I can make the right decisions. Sometimes I may forget my insurance plan numbers or something else but I can definitely ask questions without issue. So even if I am unsure or confused I have no problem making sure I understand before I leave. 
-1	I think I'm probably average. Sometimes I feel a bit uncomfortable asking too much because Doctor's always seem to be in a rush. If I am comfortable with a Doctor then I am much more likely to obtain and understand the information I need or should have.
1	I believe I am able to understand the health information I need to to make appropriate decisions. I can read well and have an educational background in health sciences. I also know how to use the Internet to look up information.

1	I feel I have the capacity to do all of that to a high degree. I do not think that it is very complicated at all. I have confidence in my ability to handle all of the above with little to no trouble. I think I would be able to handle it at any given time.
-1	"I think that I do have the capacity to process and understand basic health information.  Sometimes it gets very confusing and I'm not sure what questions I should ask in order to be fully informed.  I often find that the doctor is telling me information and I am just nodding and saying ""ok"" because I am not sure what other information I might need to know in order to make the proper decisions."
-1	In order to get the good health it would be very good and nice of it.It would be very good getting a good health is very important one it would be very important in life fo it
1	I feel like I am adequately prepared to understand and assess all of the information that I am presented with. I am not afraid to ask questions or to let people know that I don't understand what I am being presented with. In order to ensure that I get the best possible health care, it is essential for me to ask questions and have things explained to me so that I can properly care for myself and make decisions about my life. 
-1	Health literacy includes numeracy skills. For example, calculating cholesterol and blood sugar levels, measuring medications, and understanding nutrition labels all require math skills. Choosing between health plans or comparing prescription drug coverage requires calculating premiums, copays, and deductibles.
1	not presently an invalide i can and do inquire about my health with drs, etc. i also do myown reearch about health issues i may have which have been dislcosed by the drs.

-1	I feel that I have the same level of understanding of the medical system as the average person. A lot of things that are written or said by doctors are in their own language, and they sometimes forget that they need to put things in normal terms for people to understand them. Forms can be confusing, mostly it is just the way some questions are worded and you have to get clarification on what they are exactly wanting from you.
1	I am a literate, college educated adult. I believe I am fully capable of completing health forms, communicating with health professionals and making decisions about my health care. Of course there are always those times where I leave an appointment and realize I forgot to ask a question or when I think of a question after I have left an appointment. 
1	I usually follow what they're saying. If I know in advance I'll write my questions down. A lot of the time if I don't do that I'll have additional questions later.
-1	I beleive that I have a high ability to understand. I am a caregiver to my father who has a lot of health problems and I was once to my mother as well (5 years). I am the go to person for this type of thing in my family.
1	I do feel that I am able to understand the materials provided to me by doctors as well as ask any questions for items that I may not understand for my basic health and wellness.
1	I don't have any problems understanding what doctors tell me.  I usually look up things before hand so that I am well-informed.

I also feel that I can look up answers, make phone calls, ask for help, and otherwise access whatever resources I need in times that I am confused or uncertain so that I can make sure I have the knowledge that I need to make good decisions about my health and healthcare.  I have access to the internet and to people who can help me when needed.

1	I believe that I am able to understand basic health information.  I would consider that to be things that one normally comes across in everyday life, not rare illnesses or issues.  I am well read and literate, and do not have issues understanding most literature.
1	I've never had a problem reading any health related documents. I have a bachelor's degree in a health related field so it's usually second nature to me. I have many friends and even family members who also work in the health field that will help me if I need anything. If I don't understand something I either ask or search on google.
-1	I have the capacity to understand the basic decisions that need to be made in health matters. I run into trouble when it comes to weighing different choices that have to be made that could have different outcomes. For instance, choosing between different treatment options with different side effects. When a doctor will not give a strong recommendation either way it can be challenging
-1	I don't think I understand most medical terms. However I have no problem with asking doctors or pharmacists questions to understand what the condition is and what the medication is.
-1	I think that overall, I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. I do generally have whichever parent is with me (I don't drive) help out with things like insurance information, but overall I feel confident in my ability to communicate with doctors and nurses.
-1	I believe I can adequately obtain help understanding,  and processing basic health information and services.  I've had an injury in the past where if something wasn't clear to me there was an employee explaining anything needed.

-1	I feel I have a fairly good ability to obtain information and process it however at times it is really not that easy to do so. I find that it is difficult to get much time with my doctor and my time with the doctor is rushed. The nurses are some help but also are focused on moving people out of the office very quickly.  
-1	I think I have a decent grasp on how to navigate the health industry. The Terminology is confusing at times but I think I can understand for the most part. 
1	I believe I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services. I have maintained a healthy lifestyle and do not have any health problems. I have done so by listening to my doctor when I have been sick or had complications with certain things.
-1	I think I can handle it with a little help, there is always the option to ask for help, specially from the doctors and nurses, and based on all the info I can take an appropriate health decision.
1	I feel I have a good degree of understanding  basic health information. I used to work in the medical field so I was able to get a good understanding through patients I interacted with and learning from the doctor and other co-workers. 
1	It's not that hard to obtain and process medial information. I just have to tell my doctor everything I can and remember that there is always more I could say. I try to be accurate and thourough with the information I provide.
1	I believe I do a sufficient job in understanding basic health information and making appropriate health decisions. This may due to my above average knowledge of the general medical field as I have taken college courses regarding health and medical services.
1	I feel that I have enough knowledge to care for myself and understand the information that the doctors may present to me. I am not worried about not having anyone with me at anytime for any medical reasoning. 
1	I think I have as much capacity as anyone could have.  I hardly ever get sick and have never had a major illness luckily.  Neither has my daughter.  I can easily fill out forms for myself or my daughter when needed.  We are very fortunate to be extremely healthy and very rarely do we need the services of a doctor.
1	I feel that I have done enough self research that I can understand most anything that I need to as far as health information and services go. If I don't know something, I would most likely research it myself instead of asking someone else for help.
-1	I feel that I can do most of the information, but you there is usually information that is obscure. I think just making medical questions basic and simple would be much more helpful. 
1	I feel like I have the capacity to understand what a doctor is telling me.  If there is something I don't understand, I know what questions to ask and also where to look up any information that i need.  As for decisions, I have the tools to understand and make an informed choice.
-1	As long as there is someone around who can help me if needed, even if everything seems very simple, I will usually have the confidence to understand and correctly fill out forms. The approachability of the nurse or doctor helps with the ability to ask questions that are needed.
-1	In general, I know some information and details about the health related services. It could be improve my knowledge. I want seen many information about the health related service. I take more time in google search for this kind of information. 
-1	I always feel when I go to my doctor that they really do not seem to care about what is going on with me, therefore they do not really explain all the details on what I need to do t make my condition better. Or they just give me the run of the mill answer, not really getting to the root of the problem.
-1	I feel like I am more than capable of understanding health information myself, but doctors and nurses often underestimate me or don't give me all the information. I frequently find myself googling conditions or medications to get more information. Many doctors and nurses I've seen have been condescending to me, which has made me feel uncomfortable asking questions, so I have to seek out the information myself.
-1	I have the ability and capacity to achieve and process, but hospital and medical settings are intimidating and there are times when I find that I just want to be out as soon as possible, even if that means not asking questions or understanding.
-1	I feel very comfortable that I am able to understand basic health services.  Although sometimes services may be unclear, and the doctors diagnoses may bring about some confusion, I am generally able to understand and comprehend my illness and how to work other health services.  A lot of the times instructions are not entirely clear which also causes confusion.  This is probably my biggest issue.  Also, the handwriting of physicians is awful and makes it really hard to understand what they are trying to tell you.  Overall, I am confident in my ability to understand basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	Yes, I am a capable adult human being that can understand medical procedures and issues.I am also very confident in my abilities to google anything I am unsure of.
-1	I think I do. Sometimes I don't quite understand how to fill out the forms, because the forms are different depending on the place you are at. My last appointment the forms were different a bit, and I signed in the incorrect place, and they had to redo them. 
1	I'm comfortable enough with my doctor to where I have no problems asking questions about my health, and any test results I have been administered. I also know how to look up information, in regards to bettering my health, no matter what it is.
-1	For the most part I have the necessary skills and means to understand and process information that is told or presented to me. Depending on my mental state I might need someone else to look over it or ask important questions for me.
1	I think that my father did a pretty good job in all of my doctor's visits as a child to be able to understand what to do during visits so that I'd be able to go by myself when I got old enough. In general, I know my family's history and some of the specific issues that I want to double check with my doctor to make sure there are no issues there (cancer and heart issues). I know enough about services for the one issue I have with colitis and can adequately ask about that. I know where to go on the internet to get more information if something is unclear to me.
1	I think I have 100% capacity to obtain, process, and understand all my basic health info and services need and I am currently able to make appropriate health decisions. 
1	As long as I am clear and understand what they are telling me I'm okay.  If I have questions I am not afraid to ask because if I do not I can not make an enducated decision.
-1	I definitely have the capacity. I have a moderately high level of understanding of what I'm read and am told, and I have the agency to be able to make my own decisions about my health.

-1	I can understand basic health information very well. I sometimes need to do further reading on my own at home to get a full understanding. I don't make the doctor explain everything in detail, I can easily find the information on my own via the internet. 
1	I have all of the abilities I need to read and process this type of information and make my medical decisions. I don't need anybody's help with that at all.
-1	I am rather confident that I have the ability to do so. There are some questions I'm unsure about, specifically questions that might pertain to past injuries sustained in sports and that could be affecting me at the time. I don't have any medical school background but I make sure to ask as many questions as necessary to satisfy my curiosity about my medical issues almost every time I go to be seen by a health professional. I also feel that most health professionals in our area are competent and have the patient's best interest in mind.
-1	I think I have a pretty good idea about it, but with the issue of insurance, it makes the whole process a lot more harrowing. I understand what doctors tell me and have a general idea of what to fill out on health forms, but there are times when that intersects with insurance and I'm at a complete loss
-1	I think i have a pretty good understaning of how to translate medical materials from a dr point of view to that of an average joes point of veiw without much of an issue.
-1	I believe I tell them enough. I do have some regrets after the appointment where I forget to tell them some detail but that results in little consequence.
-1	"I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions - but not always immediately.  I will often need time to ""research"" the information myself prior to making a decision.  Sometimes this results in me having to call the doctor back."
-1	i like the doctors that i go do. if there is anything that is in writing and i am not understanding they are willing to sit down and explain things no matter how long it is going to take then to explain. If the doctor is there and the nurse needs further help he is going to do the same thing to assist. the hospital always wants to make sure the patient is well aware of their diagnosis the medicine was was given and the amout of what needs to be taken. 
-1	I should probably ask more questions when interacting with my doctor. Often they seem busy and I don't want to take time away from another patient with perhaps a more urgent condition.
1	I feel I have a great understanding of what I need to know, after an appointment with a medical professional. If I do not understand something, I have no problem asking for more explanation. I never leave with unanswered questions or not understanding the information given to me.

-1	I feel like I have the capability to understand and ask the appropriate question to ensure that I understand health information and services.  In today's age it's pretty easy to find out information online either through search engines or forums dedicated to medical information.  I am very confident that I can ask my doctor as well any questions I may have.
-1	I feel like i am able to understand most of what they tell me. If i have questions about what is happening i will ask them.

If im having a procedure done i make sure i fully understand what is happening and what is suppose to happen. 
1	I feel that I am able to comprehend basic and advanced medical information that would be needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself. I generally understand any information given to me and I am able to ask for any help if I do not understand.

-1	I believe that I am able to do the things that I need to do and that is why I do the things that I need to do to make sure that I get things done.
-1	Sometimes I don't always ask a question for fear of sounding a bit stupid but the older I get, the more information I want regarding my health. I think I am fairly healthy except for the fact that since the age of 17 I found out I have NF1
-1	I feel as though I have a very good understanding of medical processes and health decisions because I do my research and know the general jargon that these professionals use. I tend to do research on things I don't understand so that I know what decisions to make. 
1	i am confident that i can make my decisions.  I don't need much help with reading materials.  I am not afraid to ask questions.
-1	i have learn biotechnology so that i can knew some information about the medical and health terms but in some cases i have to clarify with the doctor

-1	I don't really understand anything related to health information, because I have trouble understanding technical words and I rarely make healthcare decisions.
-1	I feel fully capable of obtaining the information I need to make informed decisions on my health. Having worked in the medical software profession has helped me quite a bit with it.
-1	I feel quite confident in my ability to understand basic health information and then use it to make health decisions.  I'm not shy about asking doctors or nurses to explain something if I want more information or feel I don't understand it.  Sometimes I might not ask all the important questions, or think of them at the appropriate time, but usually I'm okay about that.  And I find that doctors and nurses typically do a good job of explaining things anyway, which makes my role easier.
-1	I do have the capacity to obtain and process the information that is given to me to make appropriate health decisions. It can be sometimes confusing if the doctor doesn't explain it or uses words I do not know which makes me confused about the topic. Otherwise, though I can often obtain all the information and when they give you sheets or directions on paper often helps with the refreshment of memory and is sometimes better explained.
-1	I feel as if for the most part I am able to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The only time I might need help is if it goes in depth to terms I wouldn't understand.
1	I've always had exceptional reading comprehension, and my mother was a nurse so health related information is something I can easily understand. I'm also not the type of person to feel embarrassed or afraid when I need to ask the doctor hard questions.
-1	I feel like in general I do have that capacity. Sometimes I don't understand technical details though, which can lead to misunderstandings. I usually ask questions or for help but sometimes I am too embarrassed to do so.
-1	If you are like most people, you have opportunities to initiate difficult conversations on a frequent basis, but they probably donât really feel like âopportunitiesâ,  we are using the term âdifficult conversationsâ to convey a situation where both parties in the conversation need to stay in a relationship, the stakes are high, opinions vary and emotions may run strong. At work, situations may arise between you and your supervisor that call for you to initiate a difficult conversation. Your supervisor may be many things, but it is doubtful s/he is a mind-reader. 
-1	I feel like it is completely within my capacity to obtain basic health information and services. However, it is a bit more difficult to always process and understand that information. I feel like the last few times I saw a doctor, the appointment was extremely rushed, and did not allow me the time to ask all of the questions I had about the information I'd received at those appointments. My doctor gave me print-outs, which were a little helpful, but felt like a lazy way of ensuring that I was provided with the information I needed. I ended up having to do online searches at home to fully understand everything that was discussed at my appointments.
-1	I feel like I am adequate enough to understand health information that I receive from the hospital or a doctor. The health professional usually dumbs it down enough for me to understand it.
-1	Iâm the type of person who asks a lot of questions and will openly say âI donât understand any of thisâ, so assuming health professionals can answer my questions, Iâll get all the information I need. 
-1	I feel over all I understand most of everything but when I don't feel well it's harder for me to understand things. I mean I could be tired, sick and sore. It's hard to process information at that point. It's at that point I need my wife or a nurse to help me out and explain some information to me. 
-1	I would say so. Doctors sometimes talk in hard to understand ways.It is some times hard to tell if it is on purpose or not. Sometimes you wonder if doctors are about numbers
1	I feel I have all of the tools and knowledge to obtain any medical information necessary. I am not afraid to ask if I need assistance or an answer to my questions. 
1	I feel pretty confident that I am able to understand most of what my doctors and nurses tell me in the office; If I don't , I ask, or I look it up myself
-1	As a former Nurses Assistant and Med Tech i feel i have an above average understanding of medical terminology and practices.
1	Although I don't know much about the medical profession, I am typically able to grasp articulate explanations regarding the medical aspects pertinent to my well-being. If I don't understand something, I either ask for clarification or research it myself. I'm pretty bright most of the time.
1	I feel I have decent capacity to achieve all of these.  The internet is a good source of info that I can leisurely spend my time on as needed for this.  Google and discussion forums provide most of the info I would find if I need to conduct such as search.
-1	I have no problem answering or asking questions regarding my health. Growing up, my mother was a nurse so I was often around medical jargon. Even when in college, though I am not in the medical field, I enjoyed taking health and nutrition and anatomy classes. I also feel that I have the resources that if I have questions, I can speak up and find someone to help me make the most appropriated decision for my well being.
-1	I believe that I have the mental and physical capacity to obtain, process, and understand the information and services for health decisions. However, emotionally, I often feel that I don't have the capacity, as I am often stressed when visiting a doctor's office and either forget questions or feel ashamed to ask them. Financially I also avoid going to the doctor's, so when I do go it is usually for something unrelated to the questions I have been having in my day-to-day life. 
1	I believe that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  I try to stay fairly well-informed, especially when the information pertains to my own health or the health of someone in my family.  My sister and mother are both RN's, so I have people to ask in case I'm confused and my primary provider isn't available.  I try to take the time to think of all symptoms, instances and relevant information.
-1	i feel like i usually understand the main points but not always the details or the reasoning behind what they are telling may. I dont understand enough to really form my own opinions on things, so i just do what the doctor says and hope it is what is best.
-1	I think in the event that I interact with health professionals that I have a fairly good capacity to obtain and process basic health information. I regularly independently research from respected sources, but I tend to prefer getting information directly from health professionals I'm working with since they will have better perspective on my individual health condition.
1	I feel I can get and obtain basic health information with no problem. My go to would being doing research online if I really didn't understand anything and there was not a doctor or nurse to ask questions of.
1	I don't have any problems understanding health information that is provided to me either in written form or verbally, and I can fill out my own medical forms. Also, I always ask as many questions as I need to of my health care providers.
-1	I am confident that I can understand written information. However, my people skills are below average, and I often don't ask the questions that are in my head because I don't have much confidence in how they will be received. When I do ask questions, I understand the answers, but I often go reading for follow-up information because it is easier to me. 
-1	I feel fairly unconfident in understanding medial lingo. A lot of the terminology is really hard to take in. Especially if I'm already worried about the procedure or the test results. 
-1	I feel I have an understanding of how to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. The issue I face is extracting that information from the healthcare professionals. I am very often left to google information on my own.

-1	I think that I have the knowledge to understand and make the correct health decisions. I am confident in the choices that I will choose to choose.
1	First of all, I don't get sick that much.  I usually only have bronchitis and seasonal allergy so my condition is pretty simple. If at any given time I don't understand I will try to ask question or research it afterwards. For myself personally, I don't have any issue.  On the other hand I have to care of my love one and sometimes I could come into terms that I do not understand then I will request the health care provider to give me a simpler explanation.
-1	I think I have ample ability to gather and use medical information. I'm reasonably well-educated, such that even if I don't know what something means, I would be able to look it up and understand the definition.
1	I am college educated and competent, and have the mental capacity to take care of any health issues that come my way in the near future.

1	I am completely capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information in able to make appropriate decisions.  The only problem I have is when Doctors or Nurses have trouble communicating or just don't want to spend the time to answer relevant questions.  I have changed doctors for this reason.

-1	I feel that I have the appropriate capacity to, at the very least, obtain the information I need to make important health decisions. Sometimes it will take me a while to understand and process the information, and I may not always be able to digest the info given to me in a doctor's meeting, etc., but I feel that over time, with the help of the internet and following up with a doctor, I can understand all that I need to.
-1	I feel as though I can understand basic health information pretty well. I have some background in the medical setting so I do sometimes completely understand what they are talking about. I am more likely to look something up after I leave than ask the doctor or nurse then. 
-1	I usually have no difficulty at all understanding health information and health forms. Every now and then I need assistance to understand a term I have never seen before
-1	I believe that I have the capacity to understand basic health information quite well. In the instance that I do not understand something fully, it is usually easy to get clarification from a doctor or nurse that is working on the issue. Sometimes, it is a situation that is not cut and dry and they may not HAVE a definite answer. 
1	I feel like I have the proper amount of capacity to fill out and obtain any and all health information and services that I need to make appropriate health decisions. I make sure that I'm always asking my doctors questions about my health and trying to understand completely what it is that's going on with me or what it is that I'm being diagnosed with. I always make sure that the doctors are explaining things thoroughly and if I feel like I need more information about something, I'll make sure that I'm asking them to try and explain things a little bit better to me.
1	I feel I am able to understand health information and understand what I am told about my health. I feel I am able to ask the questions which will enable me to generally understand my health and the treatment options open to me.
-1	For the most part, I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I prefer to have my husband with me at all times to help fill out paperwork and digest information. This is just because it is better to have two sets of ears hearing what is going on and processing the information. We are then able to talk through the information later to make sure we both understood everything. My husband is also a lot better at thinking of questions to ask in the moment, whereas I need to process information before I can think of questions.
-1	I believe that in general, I am capable of comprehending basic health decisions. I agree that I may need some assistance in understanding the technical mumbo jumbo. If I do I more often than not am capable to understand what is being stated to me afterward.
-1	After eleven years of life with type one diabetes and various other endocrine fuckery, yes, I feel I have the capacity to look information up, verify it by checking the references, and ask my pharmacist and doctor for help. I've had a lot of practice. Unfortunately at this point most of my questions are beyond my doctor and I dislike the endocrinologist available to me, so I depend on my own research skills and online communities of people with my conditions to do further research -- but that's a point beyond 'basic health information'.
1	I am a reasonably intelligent person, so I feel equal to the task of understanding health information provided to me by my care providers. I also make sure to get clarification of anything I donât understand. I ask lots of questions, and listen intently to what my care providers are telling me. I said that I often give my care providers all the information they need to assess my health, but I do some times hold back information that I find embarrassing. This is not often the case, but I do so on occasion. Also, I am perfectly capable of interpreting the literature provided to me by pharmacists, nurses and doctors, and very rarely have to have someone help me read and interpret. 
-1	I feel like i understand the health information pretty good. I have kaiser so i can get help very easy they are just a phone call away if i have a question i can email my doctor very easy and have an answer pretty much the same day.
-1	I think i know about most diseases, If i go to a Dr. and don't understand something I am not afraid to ask, I also have my spouse with me if I think I might be given information that I might understand or be confused about. I like to ask if what a doctor suggest might affect other problems I have, 
1	I am intelligent person, so I am aware of all avenues that are available in order to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. If there is not a licensed doctor or other medical person physically present where I am, any information I would need to find can easily be found on the internet.
1	I believe that every person should have at least basic knowledge in health related field. Of course doctors and nurses would know more, but the final decision is always up to You, so You have to make an informed decision. If i need to learn something - i do it, no matter how hard it would be
-1	I can completely understand and process any basic health information that I am given. My only issue is that sometimes doctors do not plainly discuss information and seem to be guessing, or at least being noncommittal to their answers to my questions. Doctors also do not seem to like to admit that they do not know something to be certain, in my experiences. 
1	I feel I have a good capacity to obtain and understand the information given to me. I always explain everything that bothers me, and answer questions honestly. If a question comes up later, or I need clarification of something that was said, I call the doctor back to discuss the matter. My doctors are very good at explaining things in terms that people without a medical background can understand.
-1	I feel like I understand most of what doctors or nurses tell me. I feel there is enough time for to me have them clarify anything I don't understand, or I can go online afterwards to find out more details myself.
-1	I feel I'm intelligent enough to understand most information provided to me by my doctor. If I have a hard time understanding information, I'll rephrase my question or simply tell him I don't understand what he means. I sometimes think of additional questions after my appointment. If so, I'll usually look on the internet for answers. If I'm not confident in the information I find online, I'll call my doctor's office and ask to speak with him over the phone.
-1	I think I have enough information processing ability, but sometimes health information can be pretty complicated so I am not confident enough in my ability to understand complicated information. I think I will need things put into simpler terms so that I may not only understand them better, but also commit them to memory and actually learn about the information. I also have trouble making decisions for myself so I need help filling out forms and deciding how to proceed with medical decisions.
1	My doctors are always to me by phone throughout the week and they do not mind answering any questions or concerns that I have. I also have a local pharmacy with knowledgeable pharmacists who are willing to answer questions and concerns about my medications. 
-1	I feel that I have an above average ability to understand all of the information that is needed to make health decisions. I have an interest in health topics and do quite a bit of reading. However, it can be difficult to trust my own decision because I am not an expert in the field.

1	I am a Registered Nurse. So I am more than familiar with most things I would run into. I would not have any problems understanding
-1	I feel very capable of understanding health information.  I struggle sometimes when I feel rushed asking all the questions I need to get all the information I need.  Often I think of questions  after I have left a doctor's office that I forgot to ask.  I try to make lists when I know I have an upcoming appointment.
-1	I feel confident about my degree of health literacy. I am familiar with reading scientific journals. I understand the meaning of most health terms and can research anything I do not understand for the most part.
-1	I feel that i have most of the information that i need. I am usually pretty confident when filling out forms or making recommendations to my doctor. I feel that we work well together to keep me healthy.
1	I feel 100% confident I can get the information and services I need since I grew up always fending for myself and when I didn't know something I'd goto the library and figure out myself or look it up online. I have no problem asking for help or more information if I can't figure it out for myself.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to a good degree. The basic amount I would assume is average.
1	I know I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand the information and services that my doctor is providing me because I have experience at work to know the things that doctor explaining to me. Sometimes I google it and make sure that I fully understand all the terminologies that was provided to me
1	I definitely have the ability to make appropriate health decisions. I am very proactive with my health, and I try to keep notes of questions or concerns I have when I go to the doctor. I also am not afraid to ask questions or ask for help if I need it. I do not want to be in a situation where I am not confident in my diagnosis or treatment.
1	I feel like I am comfortable enough with my primary care physician at this point to basically say anything or ask any questions. I have a basic background in medical training due to classes taken for pharmacy courses, even though i didn't complete the degree I feel like i have enough of an understanding of medicine and the field to understand basic terminology and ideas. 
1	I'm extremely confident. I've got a background in both clinical psychology and i'm a certified professional educator in the state of Florida with certifications in teaching Biology and General Science on the high school level.
1	I feel that I can understand what they tell me without additional help, because I have a pretty good memory. Also, if I wanted to find more information, I would trust the internet more than a single doctor to tell me specifics.
1	I feel I am fully capable of understanding basic health information whether it be something I read or what questions to ask. If I am unsure I will ask or look up online if need be.
-1	I believe that I have adequate health literacy. College has helped me learn this, especially since my major is Public Health Education. I do sometimes blank out when filling forms, though, and often ask my mom for help. I sometimes do not tell all of how I am feeling. I sometimes do not understand what the doctor says, but just let them go on with it.
-1	I lack confidence when trying to process information related to health and wellness. I find that the words and techniques are in a language that only people in the medical field can understand fully. There is a lot of technical jargon contained in the materials that average people usually cannot understand. I usually have to rely on speaking directly to my doctor or nurse to make sure that I understand what is being said. There are only a few websites that are dedicated to explaining medical terminology and even these can be complicated to understand.
1	I am very confident in my abilities to help myself and to help others. I have no issue standing up to medical professionals and advocating for myself and others. I research things quite a bit on my own. 
1	i have a very high degree to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in order to make health decisions.  Through  my employer, i have a very good health care plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield.  I can see a personal care physician or a specialist if i have any problems.  I can also visit the emergency room should it ever be necessary.  I process the information given to me well as i speak english fluently and tend to pick up on things easily.  I have a master's degree in economics which has helped me process new and somewhat complex information.  I can also use internet websites in order to verify information.
-1	I 5ink I am pretty compitant when it comes to medical matters.  Sometimes I donât understand some of the wording and I ask for help. I sometimes ask my dad who has a medical degree or my cousin who is a medical reassearcher.  I also sometimes have questions about prescriptions and I ask my cousin who is a pharmacist to help with any questions or concerns that I may have. 
-1	I feel mostly competent in the basic health information interactions, but once in a while may ask family for advice/help.
-1	I think I have a basic knowledge of what is required by a layperson to evaluate, and determine if someone needs to seek medical attention.  I have two small children and would take them to the doctor or call if I thought one of them was in need of seeing a doctor.  While I do not have medical training, I can tell when someone is sick.
-1	Yes, I do pretty well with this normally. If I need a little bit of help I have doctor friends I will ask for their input sometimes. However, that is usually not the case and I end up doing things on my own.
1	i feel that i have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. if i do not understand then i make sure that i ask enough questions until i do understand. i have never had a problem with getting the information that i need regarding my health.
1	I think I'm pretty competent and well informed about my medical stuff. My doctor is open and honest and I don't feel ashamed asking questions. Sometimes I forget but whatever I don't ask at the appointment I can google when I get home or email my doctor.
-1	I feel like I am capable of understanding basic health information, my main issue is when doctors or nurses use medical school grade vocab and I have no idea how to even spell what they said to look it up myself. Or they will push a certain product or treatment (ie the HPV Vaccine) when I do not want it.
-1	I feel I have an above average capacity to obtain, process and comprehend basic health information because my significant other has worked in the medical industry all of her life (her father is a doctor, she is a nurse) so I have been exposed to and actively consulted medical professionals throughout my adult life.
-1	I have most of the time the help to get health information from doctors. But I rarely go to hospital and see doctors. It is not appropriate to judge from my experience.
-1	I believe I have a high capacity to understand basic health information, I have family in the healthcare industry and I've learned through them and through reading on how to be effective in asking questions and learning about different health problems. 
-1	I work for a health insurance company so I have a little knowledge on how to complete forms and probably have an above average idea of what information is needed to complete forms.  My major in college before I changed my mind was pre med so that also puts me at an advantage over most people.  I feel that I can either complete most forms and understand basic health information at a reasonable comfort level or I know which questions I need to ask to be able to.  I am not afraid to ask if I do not understand something because this is my health and I am not taking any chances when it comes to my health and my livelihood.
-1	I am pretty sure I have the basic knowledge to understand health information. There are times when I need to go to the internet to look things up further but then when I do that, I still have a hard time understanding at times.
-1	I can understand the basic information given, but feel like there is a lot that could still use explaining. I usually have to make a list of key phrases that the doctors or nurses say and then google them on my own.
1	I feel that I am reasonably able to comprehend and obtain the basic information to make appropriate decisions regarding my health.
-1	If I get confused by what the doctor or nurse is telling me I research my condition online. This can be a little exhausting but it's worth it. I go to Web MD and other sites like it; there's a lot of valuable information there. Younger doctors communicate better than older doctors; they care more.
1	I believe that I have all the resources that I would possibly need for healthcare questions and information. I have a solid healthcare team who have helped me every step of the way.
-1	I feel like I have the basic understanding but I find it difficult to get things done because of outside forces that I have no control over, it is kind of a pain in the ass to be perfectly honest. 
-1	I feel that I have somewhat of a high level to obtain, process, and understand basic information and services needed to make the right health decisions. When I don't understand something, I will usually ask questions but a majority of the time, I am able to process the information given. I feel that if I don't understand then I definitely need to know. That's very important and should not be overlooked. 
-1	Because medicine is a complex area, it is sometimes very difficult to understand exactly what they are saying since it is all comprised of jargon. The doctor or nurse could try and explain it in layman's terms, but sometimes it can be lost in translation. 
-1	I feel like there have been times when I have planned ahead what to ask my doctors so I can be informed about my health.   But there have also been times that I feel like I have not asked enough questions and things were not explained thoroughly enough to me.   Luckily I have friends and family I can turn to in order to help me understand. 
1	I studied a lot of science in college so I have some general knowledge of many of the medical terms so it's not so hard for me to process everything.
-1	"I feel like I have the capability to understand very basic health information, but anything beyond the basics presents a challenge to me.  I find it very confusing and a lot of times, doctors are so smart in their profession that they don't know how to ""dumb it down"" for me."
1	I feel like I can understand most things doctors and nurses tell me about my health. If there are things I don't understand, I have no problem asking for clarification from medical staff. Regarding medical forms, I feel very comfortable filling out medical forms for myself, I don't have a crazy medical history so it make it pretty easy to fill out forms at doctor appointments. 
-1	I feel there is enough information to read online, and from different sources to compare information, to be adequately informed about health information. I tend to want to do things on my own but then I don't fully get the whole picture because I don't know, or want to know, what's going on.
1	I make sure to read all the materials carefully so I understand fully. I ask questions as they come up for clarity when needed. I can generally fill out all forms by myself but can get help for clarity if needed.
-1	Obtaining information is not difficult.  The process and understanding is difficult sometimes.  This really is evident when it comes to cost.  More often then not, healthcare providers have no idea what a procedure or condition will cost. 
-1	I feel I understand everything most of the time. There are times, mostly when I have to make a decision between two treatments or something similar, that I become confused because I cannot decide which is better and I'm not sure that I have all the information necessary
-1	I have a high degree of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information. I have worked in the healthcare industry for years. In addition, I have a large network of clinical professionals who I can reach out to. My network includes physicians, nurses, medical staff, and clerical staff. I think after years of working in the healthcare industry and working with patients, diagnoses, services, CPT codes, etc. I have more confident in understanding the materials that are presented to me. I also understand what is being told to me by a medical professional. I sometimes still struggle to ask specific questions. 
1	At this point in my life, I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to make decisions appropriate to my health care.  As I am currently alone, I hope that should the need for help arise, that I am able to find such assistance.
1	IM VERY CONFIDENT THAT I UNDERSTAND WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL STUFF. I DONT KNOW EVERYTHING BUT I KNOW AND IF I DONT KNOW I ASK OR LOOK IT UP. 
-1	I am able to understand just about any basic health conditions I need to. When I or someone in my family have a health condition, I am usually able to research that condition on the internet so that I feel more knowledgeable. 
-1	I feel that I definitely have enough competency or capacity to process my own basic health information. I worked at a pharmacy for years so I have quite a bit of familiarity with medical terminology as well as having family in the medical profession which helps too. 
1	Having spent far too many years in graduate school (teaching science/math classes and being around MDs and PhDs), I've become confident both in being able to understand information but also not being afraid to ask if I don't understand something. I'm also confident in my ability to do my own research regarding health information and services.
1	After going through a serious medical issue within the past 2 years, I feel like I am completely able to comprehend basic health information and make an informed decision.
-1	Usually, when I have difficulty understanding certain health information,  I search online for answers.  If I still couldn't make a decision or have difficulty understanding the situation,  I make sure to ask my doctor the next time I visit him.  My doctor is a very nice person and would explain everything in simple terms. 
1	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain and understand basic health information.  I ask my doctor when I am concerned about a health issue.  I look-up information on the Internet to supplement information from medical providers.
-1	I feel like im very capable to get all the information I need to understand all my health information. Either if its from someone else helping me or asking the doctor questions
1	I completely have the capacity to obtain, process and understand written and oral communication regarding my health. I know how to ask questions and to ask for clarification when needed. I know how to communicate answers to questions about my medical situations. I do not need to have any help in this regard at all.
1	I believe that I understand documents that are given to me concerning my health. If I do have a question, I feel comfortable enough to ask my healthcare provider to explain it to me.
1	I feel I have the capacity to understand what is told to me and if I dont understand I will ask questions so I do know what is going on
-1	I feel like I usually need more information to understand the information given to me. I also have difficulty understanding how to fill out medical insurance forms.
-1	The main issue is that medical documents and also doctors speak/read in a very scientific medical manner. They use confusing words that not many people understand. I feel that these things should be simplified to ensure understanding on the patient's part.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to understand health information and make decisions. If I do not understand, I ask questions and follow up with an internet search of reliable medical information sites.
1	I am confident on this aspect of myself, because I have experienced this numerous times and I worked in a clinic setting where I interact with health professionals making it easier for me to understand to accomplish this things.
1	Currently, I'm an RN and went to nursing school, so I have a pretty good idea understanding medical conditions and knowing what to do. If I ever have questions, I ask whoever I need to, such as the doctor or nurse at the doctor's office. Because of my health background, I often don't have too much trouble understanding things. 
-1	I sometimes find it difficult to to comprehend of grasp the terminology used but I either can do further research myself and sometimes ask for better explanations.  My capacity to understand basic health information is probably better than I think. 
-1	I am pretty confident I can do this.  I have a lot of experience reading about health conditions and services available. I typically do a lot of research on the internet about health issues I or people I know have.
1	I'm pretty well read when it comes to health concerns and procedures.  I will inquire from multiple sources to make sure I understand everything about the information.  I ask a lot of questions as well.
-1	I feel like for the most part, I am capable of handling my own information and understanding it in the medial field. But there are times that I have had some pretty confusing paperwork. And I don't know if it's because I'm stupid, young, or sheltered that I have a hard time comprehending some of these things. Usually its just things like medication contradictions, or confusing information about test results.  But I certainly know how to call my own doctor and obtain my own health records, and to get help, etc.
1	I feel I have a very good capacity to obtain and understand health information. I have a good ability to read and comprehend written information. I can ask questions if necessary about what I don't understand. I usually have no trouble understanding health information that I am given.
1	In general, I have no trouble reading and understanding health-related information. I am sure the fact that I am a psychologist (PhD) does not hurt. It is also helpful that my wife is a doctoral-level nurse with 46 years of experience. When I need to select a specialist, I rely entirely on here, as she can learn in 5 minutes what would take me much longer. Who would know best about which doctor to select than a nurse with access to other nurses who know.
1	I feel I can understand most if not all of the material I receive from doctors and pharmacists. I do find that I sometimes forget to give doctors important information about my condition, and I sometimes forget or don't quite understand the information they tell me and feel like I don't want to waste their time by asking follow up questions. I do feel I have someone to help me or go with me if I am confused.
1	I have college degree, a lot of biology and science classes.  I have access to internet if have some doubt about any topic.  I always ask the doctor if I don't understand some term or procedure.  
-1	i have no problem making health decisions for myself.  I was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma 2 years ago.  It is still hard to comprehend sometimes the magnitude of future treatments and what is required.  The doctor never discussed long term percentages with me and i am afraid to ask.
-1	im not the best when it comes to health information it really confuses me and im not sure what im looking at as far as numbers they can be everywhere with the numbers
1	i feel like i have a good knowledge of the body and i have no problem understanding complex topics, or things that are explained to me. 
-1	I feel I slightly have a good capacity to understand basic health information, as well as to obtain and process it. I've had to figure it out on my own and family hasn't been that helpful. When I go to my health insurance page, it doesn't explain things that well, so I have to make a decision on my own again. And when I do go to the doctor, which is rare, they intimidate me and I don't ask questions. I also don't bring up medical things due to worry over extra tests costing money.
-1	To a great degree, I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel this way because I have the capacity to think for myself, comprehend information, and ask (when necessary) if I don't understand something that is not clear to me. I also feel like I have the capacity to step back and not make irrational and immediate decisions and the ability to ask if there are alternative options. In addition, I am capable of researching any issues online to learn more about my medical conditions.
-1	I have the full ability to answer, process, and obtain basic health information. I sometimes get confused because the medical jargon can be such that it's difficult to process, especially be pregnant - there are a lot of terms I'm unfamiliar with.
1	I feel confident about my ability to obtain and understand any medical information that is presented to me. If there is anything that I am unsure of, I would be sure to ask my doctor or nurse. I am usually apprehensive about medications, so I would be sure to ask my doctor every question that I might have about side effects or alternative treatments. If anything seems to complicated about the information, I would use internet resources in order to answer any questions that I might have. I am confident in my ability to locate accurate medical information from sites such as WebMD.
-1	I feel like I am a well educated person, so that even if I don't understand something, I can research it for myself and come up with useful questions to help me understand it better.  
-1	I am able to understand all information that is told to me or discussed with me.  I love brochures or printouts that they give me to help me understand further.  Finally, I absolutely prefer to see nurse practitioners and other providers who take the time to explain things to me.
-1	I am intelligent enough to understand basic medical terms and do not have any problem asking for things to be repeated or explained again using more basic terminology and vocabulary. I have seen a specialist once who didnât wish to explain things in an understandable way, and actually seemed to enjoy talking over my understanding, I didnât go back to that doctor and found another instead.
-1	I think depending on how the doctor explains it I can usually understand it. If they use strictly medical talk I will have issues understanding it but if they put it in a way that myself as not a doctor would understand then it would be easier to comprehend. For the most part I usually have no issues understanding what the doctor is telling me and if I do then I ask questions.
-1	Sometime I do and sometime I not do to how they words thing after we talk about it. With the changing of words it can sound differ from before
-1	I feel like the services are out there. However I also feel constricted because the processes can be complicated. When several organizations are involved it can be hard to get everything sorted out. This is even more difficult when you got a lot of stuff going on in your life. This makes it a tendency to procrastinate instead of getting help sooner.
-1	I think i do pretty good understanding these things. At times, I do need my husband's help when I do not understand a question or cant remember the answer to it. 
-1	i have dementia so sometime i can understand whats being told to me, sometimes im in a daze and have to have my daughter explain things to me. i most of the time understand, it depends on my day
1	I believe I have fared just fine in understanding health information. I generally don't need any help filling out forms. If I do run into an issue then I asked either the doctor or the nurses for clarification. 
1	I feel I have the capacity  to make appropriate decisions. I am of sound mind and judgement. I cam understand information presented to me without difficulty. 
1	i think that overall, it's pretty easy to understand basic health information. I always make sure I know everything there is to know and I before I leave I always make sure I understand everything and ask what I need to ask.
1	Given the information and questions asked I feel that I am very capable of understanding basic health information within reason. I may need clarification on various medical jargon used but I will pretty much understand what is being detailed.
-1	I feel that I can make the right health decisions because I listen closely to the doctor. If I can't understand what he said I ask him to repeat it. If I don't know what to do about something then I ask questions. I fill out all of my medical forms myself and if there is anything that I can't understand I get a nurse to help me.  
-1	I do not have a the capacity always to get all the help and information I need.  I bring someone with me to all doctor visits or hospital visits so they can help me to fully understand.  I get nervous on the spot so having a trusted person with me helps a lot.  I want to ask questions and get all the information but when I am alone I usually do not.  It is important to bring someone along.
1	I feel that I fully have the capacity to obtain process and understand basic health information.  I have been going to the doctors for a condition for over 20 years and have had to do all of my paperwork and question asking.  I have no one else to depend on.  I have to also do my husbands information.
-1	In some regards I feel like I can ask my doctors questions.  However, to access second opinions and where to go for my children and what the waiting lists are like are very difficult to understand.  Especially for mental health care and education for children with disabilities and mental giftedness.  I've had a very hard time to get any information out of anyone as to where you can get adequate mental healthcare for an extremely gifted child without compromising their education and future career options.  This is extremely frustrating.  As well, wait times in ER's for children's mental health access is very discouraging as we've waiting 24 hours to get transferred to a mental health facility with a gravely ill child having mental health problems.  Why is there the disconnect? Why isn't mental health acknowledged and it passed off as a non-medical issue and labelled a behavioral issue as well.  Who can explain that to me?
-1	I believe I have the capability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I am educated in a healthcare field and I also have had many health issues which have given me experience in understanding information given to me by my doctors and when I was in the hospital. I am a breast cancer survivor and I have had ten surgeries, so I believe that is a lot of experience. I also have worked in medical offices and centers for 12 years which has also given me a lot of exposure.
-1	i have a pretty good knowledge base and i am fully able to undersand the basics of health information and services .  So i all in all i feel i am pretty good at this. 
-1	Yes, I feel confident that I can obtain information on health services and medical conditions. It is easily accessible on the internet and thru my health insurance provider (via phone or live chat on the provider website).
1	I feel I have a strong capacity to understand what I am being told and the information I am given. If I do not quite understand something I will make sure I get more information from the health professional. It is my health and I don't want to be unsure about these things. I always like to ask about best courses to take, or alternate methods of treatments available. I would not want to engage in anything I don't fully understand.
1	I have no problems understanding health information.  I read and process information at what I would consider to be a normal rate of competence.  I haven't had any problems so far that I know of. 
1	"I feel capable enough to understand everything that is given to me, and sometimes go beyond the materials that are given to me by my physician, as I feel that sometimes these materials are ""dumbed down"" for the general public, and I prefer to get more scientific, in-depth information about health and illnesses."
1	I am very health literate, I understand the language used, the terminology and am confident enough to ask when I find something I don't know. My healthcare providers are the experts. I use their expertise without feeling embarrassed or ignorant.
-1	I need help understanding medical terms and diagnosis most of the time before I can make an informed decision. Sometimes it takes asking repetitive questions to understand.
1	I feel rather confident in my ability to gather and interpret health information. I am mostly confident in making the right decision, although at times I gather too much information, and often that information contracdicts one another ad then I feel like I am in a spat where I feel less confident. 
-1	Sometimes when I have a condition that send me to hospital I don't feel confident enough to tell the nurse or doctor about it because sometimes I feel that not everything that I'm feeling right now is not related to the condition.
1	I am very capable of understanding. If not, will ask or research on my own. All easy to do. Webmd is a great backup for this.
1	I feel like I have complete capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Most of the time, when I ask for help with understanding a condition, it is only because the condition is new to me and I would like further explanation. Most of the time the doctors are glad to offer additional information. Only when I run across the rare statement in paperwork that I do not understand completely do I ask for clarification and it is usually received promptly.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health info and services needed. If I feel like I don't, I can call the doctors office after I leave if I have additional questions and/or concerns. Or call the nurses line if it's after hours and talk to them and see if they might know. 
-1	I feel that I am somewhat able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I think that it depends on how technical the information that is provided is. I think that it also depends on how open my medical provider is to answering questions and how well I understand initially to be able to think of questions to ask the provider for clarification. If the information is simple or very basic, I am completely able to obtain, process, and understand the information.
-1	I always make the right decisions and the necessary ones, therefore I feel that I have a perfect capacity to make all kinds of decisions
-1	I usually go online and look for further explanation on things the doctor or nurse covered that I didn't understand. This helps a lot in determining what the best route for care is for me.
-1	I am fairly well educated and not handicapped in any way. Of course I understand medicine at least as well as the halfwits that admin at health clinics.
1	I think that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I make a point to either ask questions when I am at the doctor's office or I research the information myself on the computer. 
1	I'm fairly confident and capable about talking to doctors and filling forms. I know they are  there to help and appreciate good questions and thorough statements. Some paperwork can be a bit tricky, but not overly so.
-1	IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO ASK WHEN I GO TO MY DOCTOR, EVEN WHEN I WRITE IT DOWN.  MY DOCTOR DOES NOT SEEM TO WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH ME. JUST LOOKS AT HER COMPUTER THE WHOLE TIME.  I FEEL LIKE I AM BOTHERING HER. WHATEVER MY PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE, SHE WILL GIVE ME A PILL FOR IT.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain,process and understand my basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	Whenever I've visited any health professional in regards to my health I've always had the option to seek out any health information that's necessary. Almost every single time they have always given out a few sheets of paper with a brief explanation of everything as well as always constantly asking me questions if I have any. They always have constantly made me feel as if I have the opportunity to understand and obtain the information with relative ease. 
1	I think that I am generally well equipped to handle the information I am provided. I have solid reading skills, but my greatest strength is in my ability to ask questions. I am good at asking for information and paraphrasing what the physician says. My biggest complaint with my previous doctor is that he was in and out of the office so fast that it did not give me time to process information and formulate questions. My current doctor is much better about that and is excellent at communicating information.
1	I absolutely have the knowledge and ability to understand and process medical information. I am 24 and I unfortunately have enough experience with health and wellness.
1	I have no problems reading or writing English. I always understand medical information and the informational forms that need completed. I've never needed anyone's assistance filling out information and I make sure that I ask the Doc/Nurse any questions that I might have before I leave. 
-1	I feel I have a reasonable amount of knowledge to understand and process basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. There have been times when I either needed assistance on a question or needed my questions answered. I don't fully understand everything shown to me. 
1	I am confident that I can obtain and understand all the health information given to me by my health care providers, as well as from reputable online sources. I am confident I can use this information to make appropriate and educated decisions regarding my health.
-1	I am 99% sure that I am sound, mind and body as well as competent enough to understand basic information regarding my health and or making decisions dealing with my health.
-1	I feel that I have the basic skills to understand health information. I just need to learn to ask more questions when speaking with health care professionals. 
-1	"The problem is a lot of information is put into pamphlets to look good or really be read by people who already have a good understanding of medical lingo. I dont need a word that uses every letter in the alphabet twice. A lot of stuff uses too much lingo and can make you feel inadequate. Makes you not want to ask the question because ohh this person doesnt know what ""dnkfnepehdnlopidkodnghineocian"" means. Why are you wasting my time if you dont know that. If I cant pronounce or read the word then I am not going to ask about it at the office."
1	Whenever I need to communicate with physicians, nurses, or other healthcare professionals, I make sure that they explain everything to me so I understand and know what is going on. I don't have any issues with my ability to comprehend or process information at all. I make an effort to keep myself informed about possible health issues and I try to communicate with doctors or nurses effectively. 
-1	I generally feel like it is somewhat difficult to obtain enough information to be confident in making decisions about my health. Medical information can be difficult to understand. When talking with doctors it can be very difficult to remember everything they have discussed with you. And there is always the suspicion that doctors are biased towards giving treatment when it probably isn't necessary. 
1	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information to a good degree. I can read health related documents easily and can comprehend them to their fullest. I can make proper health decisions most of the time and have no problem comprehending what is required of me. 
1	I have a general understanding of all of the information that I am given or asked to provide.  They usually will highlight everything that needs to be filled out. 
1	As long as they don't use technobable only understandable by nurses and doctors I don't have problems understanding what is told to me (or read about it). The problem is (for me) to get them to give me the information (that seems to be something they don't want to give).
1	I'm fairly highly educated and have an okay grasp on some entry-level medical jargon. I don't have any trouble reading information given to me. I can easily get ahold of my primary care doctor when I have questions.
1	I believe I have a high capacity to obtain, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Most of the information is easily understandable if you read it properly. Usually if I dont understand I will infer and get the specifics in detail and comprehend better.
-1	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand basic health information that's given to me and to make decisions for myself. I don't always feel confident that doctors are giving me the right information though or that they have taken the time to understand my issues.
1	I have some medical issues, and I am a caregiver for my mother. I have NO problem asking questions and giving information to make sure all needs are understood and met. Sometimes I give more information than necessary.

-1	I feel that I have a pretty good capacity to understand health information.  Having the internet at our fingertips is helpful if their is ever a word that I don't understand or something that needs further defining.  I also have health professionals in my family that are always willing to give feedback when asked.

1	I believe I am completely capable of doing everything necessary in understanding health information and making decisions based on that information.  Any questions I've had for medical providers has been easily answered and explained.
1	I believe I have enough knowledge to understand health information, but I of course I need help from medical people sometimes to understand what the best option is and seek their advise. Dealing with a regular health care provider is pretty easy. But when my husband has been very ill and in the hospital I found getting information was excessively hard. If you did not aggressively ask you would not get an answer. And sometimes I had to persistantly ask for help about various solutions to his problems. There was no one person to talk to about someone in the hospital. It

1	I have the benefit of working at a hospital so i have ample resources available for me, especially on our internal systems. However, if I didn't have tat access, I'd feel like the amount of information I had access too is limited, unless I google everything. 
-1	I feel that I have a moderate grasp on obtaining and understanding health information but sometimes the forms and doctors make me feel very overwhelmed.
1	I don't have difficulty with anything.  Doctors and nurses are very good at explaining things in a way that I can understand.  They also provide ample opportunity for me to ask questions.
-1	I feel like I have the ability to understand and process information really well, but sometimes I forget to ask for clarification and that will usually lead to misunderstandings on my part.
1	I have a BA in a medical related field so when I am unfamiliar with a diagnosis I am given in regards to my health I usually know what to ask. Anything I am unfamiliar with and did not ask while in the presence of the health professional I usually research online to get a better understanding. Although I often call pharmacist with questions about prescriptions.

1	I have been sick for many years with CKD, and have had many experiences with doctors and hospitals therefore I believe I have a broader understanding of medicine than your average person.
1	I have Congential Adrenal Hyperplasia and Dystonia as two of my more problematic medical conditions.  Both cause me severe medical problems with far bigger repurcussions in my personal, social, and work life.  Because of the lack of support and understanding ever found a other than lies to weaken I have learned to fight for myself.  My first and core victory is never giving that up and second is seeking informed treatment while assuming others are always negative.
1	I haven't had any issues obtaining or understanding any of my health information or issues.  I asked appropriate questions to medical staff.  I research online to ensure I ask questions that I may not have thought to ask if I did not read about the subject and educate myself.
-1	I believe I have the resources to do so. I can always ask my doctor important questions concerning my health. I feel like I can go on the internet to obtain certain information.
1	I feel very confident that I can easily understand any basic health information and services that I come across. I fill out health documents for myself and also work in the healthcare industry; it is a field that I studied in college.
-1	When it comes to basic health questions. I struggle with trying to remember past concerns and history of previous diagnosis'. When it comes to the first time asking about my health and reviewing any diagnosis, I ask questions. And them it become easier with clear understanding of my health issues.
-1	I can get alot more information on my own.  I just struggle sometimes really knowing what is relevant in my situation there is so much info on the internet, its hard to know.  Doctors always seem in a rush and I try my best to ask all the questions in a visit but sometimes forget or think of things later
-1	I think sometimes I struggle to communicate verbally---like in person, I don't do a good job of explaining things. I also tend to panic and forget everything I was going to say, which means that sometimes I have follow up questions and stuff, that just don't get answered if I didn't write them down before hand. 
1	I have absolute ability to understand, and if I don't, I will ask questions until I do. I read a lot and have common sense, and any information that falls outside of that I will look on the internet to get the right answer. 
-1	I feel like I have a higher than normal capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I do a lot of research whenever I come up to something I don't know.  So, I have acquired a lot of knowledge on health when dealing with insurances, babies, etc.
-1	I feel like I am able to understand most of what they tell me. I think the hard part is remembering it later. 
-1	i usually understand what is being told to me by doctors or nurses. sometimes though i just need an afirmentation of what is being told to me. sometimes think they said one thing but they mean something else because i do not pay attention, because i am nervous 
-1	I feel that I have the capacity to understand basic health information and to process it.  If I don't understand, I have no problem asking questions until I do understand.  
-1	I think I have the capacity to understand my doctors information and to read about it online. But I think in the moment at a doctor's appointment I forget to tell them everything and so I worry they do not get the whole story. I also think that appointments themselves are expensive and I don't have the means to go to a doctor or get the tests I want done. I also think that health insurance policies are written in a confusing way where it limits what I do because I am not entirely sure what I can do. This narrows my health decisions a great amount.
-1	With the advent of the Information Age came with it the ability to research many things independently.  For example: A terminology used in a diagnoses can be researched through the internet.  This can be essays or articles that are written in plain English, or robust biological analysis.  So to answer the question.  I feel I have absolute and total control, as long as we have an ethical and strong education system that can share their knowledge on the internet.  All can be informed about almost all things.  One only needs to learn the tools.
-1	I truly enjoy working at Health Decisions. The atmosphere is very casual, friendly, and has a good work life balance. I love how management has an open-door policy and are great in communicating and providing support. 
-1	I am fully capable of understanding most health related information. I have nothing to prevent me from visiting a medical center if I decide that I need medical attention. I am also fully capable to decide what is the best health decision for me, regardless of what medical advice is given to me by the hospital staff.
-1	I generally find that I am able to understand the basic concepts regarding health decisions. Sometimes I do need to clarify and get more information on things like, for example, diabetes and what needs to be done to control that given my risk factors. The one thing that completely flies over my head though is insurance. I can never tell if something is covered or not and it's a pain to have to try and figure that out so you don't end up paying a fortune if there is a generic that's cheaper somewhere. In my experience the Doctors and staff I've seen have always been kind, patient, and attuned to my concerns and willing to take a few minutes to explain what they suggest and why. That's really an important part because they don't need to go into all the technical details...just give me an idea of my options and a basic understanding of what they're trying to solve.
1	I have an education background in biology and I teach high school A&P. I also care about my health and want to know exactly what is wrong and how to fix it.
-1	Asking many questions help me understand most health information. I also often check what I heard with research on internet. And most of the time when I have a certain condition I research the symptoms on internet even before I go and see a health care person so that I already know what questions I should be asking.
-1	I think I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. For some complex information, I may need advice from an experienced professional, but I am a curious person and I like learning about things. I think that I have slightly above-average intelligence, with an average amount of experience, but no expert knowledge of the medical field.
-1	I BELIEVE I HAVE A GOOD CAPACITY TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISION. HOWEVER, SOMETIME I NEED A CLEAR EXPLANATION FROM THE DOCTOR.
-1	Being in the medical system can be difficult and confusing. There are quite a lot of forms to fill out and its difficult when you are sick. I feel like i need more resources and information in order to make the appropriate decisions with my healthcare. The standards of care vary and some medical professionals recommend things that others do not.
1	My sister is a doctor of medicine, so in the rare occurrence where I have any lingering questions or doubts that my doctor wasn't able to answer adequately,  I ask for her input. For the most part I am able to understand basic health info, due to asking my doctor questions, reading the health info pamphlets or researching it online. 
-1	I believe I have the capacity to obtain and process health information and services needed to make health decisions.  Sometimes it is a matter of understanding the language and complexities of health care that makes making decisions difficult.
1	I feel that I can fill out paper work with no problem. If I am at the doctors and they are explaining things to me it's somewhat easy to process the information that is given to me. Sometimes I ask follow up questions to make sure that I am hearing the correct information. I feel sometimes doctors give you information in a way that is hard to understand so I feel like I have no other choice then to make sure that I am hearing everything correctly to make the right decision for myself. Once I hear the information at least twice I can be confident that I know what i need to know.
1	I feel fairly confident that I can ultimately get the relevant information I need   through any necessary direct questioning of the medical professional. Further, I will ask if have I questions about any written material that I might be given. I am not averse to seeking help from close friends nor researching an issue on the internet (though I rarely do this.)
1	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand basic health information services needed to make health decisions.  In fact, most of the time I look up the conditions online and read books about them so I have a better grasp of what I'm dealing with.  It's important for me to understand these things completely since I have really high anxiety and I am completely uncomfortable if I don't understand what's going on with me completely.
1	I feel that I do have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services that are needed for the right health decisions. I do feel that some of the answers given to me by doctors is very ambiguous and vague. I feel it's becoming more and more difficult to get a definitive answer and treatment plan by many doctors. In this way, I do find it difficult, because there seems to be a lack of concern in what I'm asking about in certain situations. I often have to rely on doing a lot of research myself, which can be difficult when trying to discern certain medical journals. 
1	I feel I am fully able and competent to get the information I need, ask the questions I need answered, and understand the answers. I have never had a concern getting information, using it, filling out forms, or anything of that sort.
-1	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basci health information and services. I usually refer to google but in the event that I need to get help for a medical personnel I would. 
-1	I mostly can. It is just knowing what questions to ask. When reading materials, it is hardly ever written in a way that someone who is not a medical professional can truly understand. 
1	My two passions when I was young were science and writing, which led me into journalism covering the sciences.  I have worked around scientists for years.  I am comfortable reading technical material and do not hold doctors or scientists on any type of plateau.  Yes, I do have the capacity to make decisions
-1	I feel that I can understand most of my health information.  I have a phobia of needles, so getting shots or having blood drawn is such a trauma for me, that my health has suffered.  I haven't been able to get a full picture of my gall bladder disease.  It's also been difficult learning what I can do to help myself without surgery because doctors don't want to let you try any other option.  They always want to remove your gall bladder. 
1	Well, I am 65 now. Currently, I have the mental capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I go to the doctor when I need to or when I have a scheduled appointment. I get all my prescriptions filled. If the doctor tells me I need to have a test done, I will follow through and have the test. 
-1	Overall i find that obtaining, reading and processing the content of medical material is very difficult and challenging. Sadly it is difficult to find someone to help me understand what's being said.
-1	I believe in understanding documents and filling out forms I find it easy to process and understand. It is when I need more information and have to ask the questions where I do stumble and or tend to ask the wrong things or word it weirdly. I have horrible social anxiety which does not help one bit.
1	I am very capable of retrieving all the information I need. I can ask questions to the nurse and doctor when I am not clear on any issue. 
-1	I feel fairly confident in my ability to obtain and understand basic health and services information. For advanced cases or something I didn't know about I would be less confident. But for average issues I think I have a good ability in understanding medical information.
-1	It depends on the day. If I'm having a good day, with no cognitive impairment from various and sundry sources, I'm pretty confident in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information, so I can make appropriate health decisions. If I'm having a bad day, and I'm experiencing cognitive impairment, be it from a physical illness, a chronic condition, a mental illness, or one of the medications to treat everything, it's anybody's guess. That's why 99% of the time I'm dealing with medical personnel, I have my primary caregiver with me.
1	i believe that i can reasonably understand information presented to me in clear terms, that i can ask questions to clarify what i do not understand, and that i can get help from family, friends or other professionals to read and decipher written information.
-1	I think that on the whole, I have a good ability to obtain and understand basic health information.  More of my personal barriers involve my comfort in communicating with doctors and nurses clearly and honestly.  There have been some occasions in the past where I have needed assistance in understanding medical information and have had to consult several sources to get the answers I needed, but this is the exception, nor the norm.
-1	"I don't feel that I have enough understanding on my own. When I visit the doctor or a hospital, I usually am worried that I haven't explained everything sufficiently. So I'll will ask the doctor or the nurse a ton of questions. I don't want to be driving away and then think ""Why didn't I remember to ask about that?""."
-1	I feel that I can understand basic health information just as well or better as most people. I think that I have a bit more understanding of health principles because I read a lot about health conditions. Therefore, I think I can make appropriate health decisions based on my base knowledge about health.
1	I have, many times in the past, successfully read and understood numerous medical documents. This includes those that come from the emergency room, family doctor, specialists, nurses, and pharmacies. Sometimes I will even read about a condition on the internet to learn more. At one time I had to read things to my grandfather, but he has passed now.
-1	I feel that I sometimes understand basic health information. There are times when I am reading my online medical chart after I get a result in that I will need to call the doctor to understand what it is saying. Most of the time I will make an appointment after getting a result back, just so I have that one on one conversation with my doctor. It feel I understand better when they explain to me face to face. That is when I feel I process the information very well. Especially when they show me different examples of what is going on in my body. It helps when the doctor doesn't seemed rushed. I think when the doctor is rushed not a lot of information is obtained.
1	I feel I have the ability to understand basic health information. I read a lot about health related issues. I have basic understanding of health related concerns I have. Also, I am good at asking questions. Based on this, I think I will be able to make informed decisions about my health.
-1	I feel i have a great ability to obtain process and understand basic health information and services need to make an appropriate health decision. I struggle when it is something that is not basic sometimes, but i can usually look up something online and quickly gather a basic understanding of most things. Also, my mother-in-law has worked for a doctors office for 30 years and has a higher understanding of most of the things that i struggle to understand.
-1	I feel as though for the most part that Iâm capable to understand most of the health information provided to me. There have been times over the years that I would need further explaining of certain things and my health professionals have been able to effectively explain things to my understanding. It has been very rarely that Iâve not fully understood something but being too embossed to ask for further explanation of said conditions I have left and researched things on my own whether using the internet or talking with family and friends to understand it better.
-1	I feel I can comprehend many of the basic health information given to me from doctors and nurses. Ive never had a problem with understanding any fallow up documents that were given to me either.
-1	"I have a curious mind so anything I may not understand I will be sure to ask my doctor to explain. I have the capacity to understand much of what I'm told. My only barrier to understanding health information is anxiety which leads me to have a tendency toward ""burring my head in the sand."""
-1	I believe that I currently have the basic information I need regarding my overall health, but I am also confident that if I were to have a question or concern, there are databases and reference centers that would help me to understand.
-1	I believe that if I don't get the answers I need from a doctor or nurse, I can always get further information online and I can use Google or WebMD or mayoclinic.com.  I an always call back the next day and ask if there is something I don't understand. I also have medical encyclopedias in case I want to look something up that I am unsure about.
1	I believe I can understand the conversations I have had with a personal physician so far.  I am 70 years old but am basically healthy other than aches and pains, and see a doctor once a year for a physical. 
-1	I feel pretty confident obtaining and understanding information as it pertains to making decisions about my health. For issues that I don't understand, I have no problem seeking and finding help. 
1	I understand everything I am told perfectly, and will take notes if need be. If anything, I ask more questions because I want to know exactly what I'm doing.
-1	I believe that I have sufficient skills an knowledge to accurately read and understand basic health information. I also know when I do not understand what I am being told and when to ask the questions I need to in order to fully convey what the practitioner is saying. Being able to do both of these things allows me to make appropriate health decisions.
-1	Oftentimes it can be quite overwhelming to take in the whole medical field information. Many terms are used that are very unfamiliar which in turn makes it all the more difficult to understand. While I may feel like asking questions I sometimes do not because I am most afraid that it will become even more overwhelming.  Most of the time I find myself googling things said by my medical professional in order to get a more clear understanding.  I also save the pages so I can refer back if I forget the terms or information. 
-1	I feel like I can understand and make basic decisions regarding my health but may need assistance with more complicated matters or forms.
1	I feel I have the intelligence and comprehension capabilities to understand any information I am given by a medical professional. The information is usually tailored to a non medical professional and I am more than capable of processing that information. I have many sources from which I can receive medical information. 
-1	I understand my health questions quite a bit if not I tend to ask the doctor or dentist office as they told me not to check on internet as they said that information is not correct and to come to them only.
-1	I have general familiarity of general, basic medical terms, however, I don't feel great about filling out forms. I tend to overthink them and am always concerned that I'm going to fill something out wrong, and have it negatively impact me in the future. 
-1	I feel I'm well equipped to obtain and understand health information. That doesn't always mean I get it from the doctor or his staff though. Often they seem so rushed and impatient it's easier just to find out what the diagnosis is, and use the internet to obtain any additional information I need.
1	I feel very confident in my abilities to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I believe this is because I am a medical student, so I have a better idea of what to ask. 
1	I am totally capable of talking to doctors or nurses about my health conditions.  I research anything they tell me and on later visits I will have a list of things to ask and I even take notes if I need to.  I may ask them about more natural alternatives of care especially concerning medication.  Doctors and nurses are human and only the patient knows what is completely  best for them.  
-1	I think I can understand health informagion to a great extent, based on my previous answers and my experience in hospitals before I only miss the medical expressions otherwise everything is understandable 
1	I am well educated with a good vocabulary, so I feel that I am well equipped to understand health information and make decisions. Further, I am a scientist, so I have an understanding of medical terms. When I do not understand health information I have the resources to figure out what it means without asking another person.
1	I feel I am very competent in understanding, obtaining, and processing basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. The main time I have difficulty would be with major health issues.
1	I feel very confidant with my ability to obtain, process, and understand health information and services I receive. I ask a lot of questions if I want to know something or need more information. I have never had a problem understanding anything my doctor or nurses have said in the past, and I don't see any change in the future. I have done what they have wanted me to do for health reasons, and i have understood why I should do what they ask me to do.
-1	I feel like I can do an okay job at it. There are definitely times I dont understand certain medical terms but I usually just ask questions and that clears things up
1	I believe i'm 75% capable of reading and processing it because i like to read up and ask questions so at this point i''m pretty up to date on medicinal info 
1	I feel that I have an above-average understanding of much health-related documentation.  I have grown up with parents who worked in the healthcare field so this helped me develop a basic understanding of many terms at an early age. Overall I would say I am above-average intelligence so this helps me grasps things with relative ease.  I have all of my abilities such as sight and cognition to understand documentation as well.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to learn and understand the basics when I visit any health professional. However, sometimes I leave the doctor feeling as if I didn't get as much information as I think I should have.
1	I have no problem obtaining or understanding basic health information and services needed to make decisions regarding my health. I often do my own research to fill in what I didn't receive from the doctor
-1	I feel confident in expressing my Symptoms to my doctors and nurses to get the necessary test and treatment needed. My doctors always make sure I have all the knowledge to understate my diagnosis and the proper medicines. They also make sure I understand the medicines and how to take properly and how to maintain my conditions at my house.
-1	I feel that for the most part I have the capacity to understand and comprehend health information. The doctors and nurses that I go to and interact with usually do a very good job explaining what means what and how conditions that I have or have had in the past work, and I am the type of person to always research medications and conditions so that I can have a better overall understanding as to what exactly I am dealing with or taking. The information that is usually shipped or tagged with medication is usually quite confusing, so having a doctor who is very good at explaining things, alongside the fact that I always ask questions and research information online keeps me informed.
1	I have experienced a health catastrophe in which I suffered through the treatment recommended by Western medicine (actually, I avoided the most recommended treatment and am not a cripple today, or dead, as a result).  I'm a lawyer.  I read and understand complicated documents for a living.  That's not to say I like it.
1	I am 100% certain that I can obtain and evaluate all of the information I need to understand my health conditions and make appropriate decisions. I have a bachelors degree in anthropology and focused on the biological side, taking several pre-med courses as well. I also went to an excellent college that focused in reading and writing, and developed the ability to research and process large quantities of information. I am skilled at getting information from the internet, recognizing reliable sources, discarding the nonsense, and using what I have learned to ask educated questions from my health providers. I see connections and understand the logic of cause and reaction.
-1	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I find it really helpful, however, to have someone else read or hear at the same time to make sure that I think of or consider everything.
1	I feel that I have the ability to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services that are needed so that appropriate health decisions can be made.  I know how to ask questions if I do not understand and I know how to call or email my doctor also.  I also know that I can ask a loved one to get their interpretation of material that I might not understand.  Also, I can ask my doctor if I can record information so that I can listen to it again in case I miss something. 
1	I feel I have the complete capacity to to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am in no way physically or intellectually compromised in such a way as to hamper my decision making abilities. 
-1	I feel that I get the information that I need from either the doctors I see or their assistants.  If I have questions about prescriptions I talk to my pharmacist, I usually get more complete information from her than the doctor on medications.  The internet has also been helpful in making decisions about my health care, in knowing which questions to ask of the doctor or hospital personnel.  I try to be very informed when it comes to surgeries or medications that are prescribed to me.  I learn best by reading, our local health care professionals are good about asking the best way that a person learns things so that they can accommodate everyone.  we are very fortunate in our health care for the rural area that we live in.    
-1	I feel somewhat confident. At times, because I am afraid of the answers, I don't ask the questions I need to ask, and I terrify myself further by reading google. But, most times, I know what I need to know.
1	I feel like I try to enter the situation with my medical provider with some pre researched information so that I have an idea of what to ask. I try to maintain a healthy level of dialogue without giving too much unneeded information so that I can naturally ask for more information should there be an instance where there's something they tell me that I don't understand. I rarely hesitate to ask for more information if needed and if I do, I try to get back with them via email or other forms of communication.
1	As of now I've been able to understand and comprehend what has been told to me. I'm lucky in the sense I haven't had any serious issues that would make it difficult for me to not understand.
-1	I have no problem reading basic health information.  I do sometimes have trouble filling out forms and generally have my wife help me with those since she's better with dates, doctor's addresses, etc.  I feel I sometimes don't get all the info I need since I'm somewhat shy and don't ask the doctors all the questions I probably should.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually check on the web for information on health issues, and when I have questions, I will ask my Primary Care Physician. He is very good at explaining things so I understand them. My brother is also a Physician. I will occasionally ask him a medical question.
1	I have a firm grasp of the English language and I'm reasonably intelligent and well read.  If I have questions about health information, I'm capable of finding a source that will answer my questions.
1	I try and get all the information I can when I am facing, or if a loved one is facing, a health problem.  I read, I research, I listen to the doctor and nurses (especially to the nurses as they are hands-on,though my doctor explains things well). The written material is not too big a challenge normally, even when  not clearly written - I do ask when it's indecipherable because I need to understand things.
-1	I am able to read and understand material given to me regarding health. If I do have a question I have no problem asking for help to understand. 
1	I believe that that I am more than capable. I have read a good deal about health related topics, and I ask a lot of questions. If I needed any help, I am able to get that help easily.
-1	Most of the time I understand what is happening with my health, therefore my level of capacity to understand is reasonably high.  I do, however, tend to skip the minutia in RX documents as it is not written in layman language.
-1	It is someone difficult to ask questions to medical providers. I often feel rushed when I'm at doctor's appointments and it's hard to think about what I need to ask. I like getting written information at the end of the visit because it is easier to understand and remember the information. 
-1	I have  the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions on my own. Most of the time I do not need assistance from others.
1	I feel that I am quite capable of managing and comprehending basic health information for my children and myself. I consider my knowledge of health matters to be above average and I know how to research reputable sources when additional information is required. I also have a great rapport with my pediatrician's office and know how to call for information if needed.
-1	I think that I have an ok capacity.  I can read just fine but sometimes the medical wording confuses me.  I'll usually do some research once I've gone to see the doctor and been given some medical advice and that usually causes me to get further confused because there is so much information.  I'm also not confident asking questions so, I think that hinders my understanding a lot.  Also, like many others, I fail to tell my doctor everything and I know that it doesn't help my situation and can really hurt my health decisions because by keeping things from my doctor, I'm only hindering my diagnosis.  
-1	I believe that, in general, I have the ability to obtain and understand health information and that I can be informed enough to make educated decisions. I feel that I am diligent when it comes to asking questions when I do not understand something.
-1	I am able to understand the medical information that is pertinent to me because I inquire what I do not fully understand from my doctors and nurses. Everything is simple enough to read and comprehend, but sometimes the medical jargon can be confusing to incorporate, so I would simply call them or setup a meeting to ask them face to face questions.
-1	If I dedicate the necessary time, I can usually figure everything out that was presented to me either in paper or verbal form. My biggest hangup is when it comes to billing from hospitals or doctors since it seems like the breakdown of charges is so detailed that it is easy to lose track of what expense was for what aspect of treatment. I do find myself not always able to ask the questions I would like to though when visiting a doctor because of how rushed it always seems. The doctors (any doctor) arrives after I have waited in the waiting room as well as in the examination room, and I know the doctor has other patients who are also waiting.
1	I feel I have the capacity to understand everything that is explained. I always ask follow up questions if I'm not sure that I understand something.
1	I feel extremely confident in filling out medical forms or any forms for that matter.  If I don't understand something, I ask questions to both nurses and doctors.  I understand the importance of taking care of my body so I do the most I can do for myself and try to educate others also.  My husband drinks a lot of diet soda which I don't think is healthy since he is a diabetic.  I am currently not taking any medications and my blood work has been great.  I hope this information helps you in your research.
1	I feel I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health info. I do sometimes do extra research after the visit to clarify and I am at times murky on details but on the whole I have a clear picture of my health and services needed.
1	I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I have never had a problem understanding information given to me by a doctor in the past. If I an unsure about anything I will ask questions until I fully understand. 
1	I feel that when the doctor/nurse/health practice employee explains things in simple terms I clearly can undertstand my information.   Specifically, if they relate the information to my temperature, weight, blood pressure, air flow, and examine my blood for sugars, iron and cholesterol.   I start to have problems when things get explained through the technical terms since I have not been trained in the medical field.
1	I believe I am competent enough to process and understand health information and services needed. I have the capacity to make smart decisions regarding my healthcare. I know what is right and wrong when it comes to my health needs. 
1	I an very interested in alternative health treatments so I am very familiar with my health issues and possible treatments.

I constantly give health advice to relatives.
1	I like to read up on conditions before I go to the doctor, so I like to think I'm pretty well informed.  I usually have some familiarity with things before I go in.
1	I feel I definitely have the capacity to understand and process basic health information and services. If I ever have questions, I have no problems speaking up and asking my doctor to explain something or answer a question I have.
-1	I don't thin I am that good at it.I have major epilepsy and because of that I do not take new information on very well.It is very hard for me to understand new things that are told to me sometimes. Especially if they are in words I do not understand.I even have to wright down all of the medication I take & all of the questions I have a few days ahead of time to make sure I have everything I need to tell my Dr when I go in. 
-1	getting the information is reasonably easy, once you are able to contact your provider, thats the biggest headache that takes the longest, Actually speaking to a doctor or nurse is difficult and it time consuming. My doctor is however very good at explaining everything, causes,syptoms, treatments.
1	I believe I have above-average capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic information. My capacity to obtain services would improve if insurance did not impede the process.
-1	I usually do research before I visited the doctor so I know what I'm up against.  If the doctor brings up something new and I don't understand it, then I will ask.  I want to know what is going on with me.
1	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process and completely understand any basic health information and/or services that are needed to make any and all of the appropriate health decisions for myself.

1	I feel that I am very capable of understanding basic health information. I do not need any help reading or filling out any paperwork
-1	I think i am able to understand basic medical information. i generally am ok with asking questions when i don't understand something, but only if the nurse or doctor i am speaking with is approachable. Some doctors are not approachable or they talk down to you and make you feel stupid and intimidated. In those cases if i don't understand something i won't say anything, i will just try to find the information on the internet later.
1	I feel I have a high degree of proficiency when it comes to the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. When situations arise in which this is not the case, I am not afraid to voice my concerns and questions and be persistent with medical staff until we can reach a mutual understanding of the information being presented.

-1	I have a good degree to obtain and process basic health information. If I need help people with be around to assist me.
-1	Well my mom had many health issues and I never had a problem figuring out anything.  If need be I would get on the internet and find answers to what I do not know.  That is the same thing that I do now with my children say for example with their vaccines.
1	I am pretty confident in myself with health decisions. I understand things easily and have no problem understanding or asking the appropriate questions when needed.

1	Whenever I have any kind of health issue, I heavily research the symptoms online, as well as all treatment options and medications, before I even go into the initial appointment.  I feel that it is very important to be informed.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to make any decisions regarding my health. I have never had any trouble comprehending anything my doctor has informed me of, and i don;t make decisions without being informed.
1	I think I have the capacity to fully understand basic information and services. Sometimes I ask for better clarification when something is a bit more complicated, but it's not that often. I've also been lucky to have doctors and nurses that explain things in detail.  
-1	Sometimes hospital and health lingo are really hard for me to understand and sometimes my health problems are difficult to understand. I try to ask my doctors to tell me about every detail of my health and I ask for recommendations to improve my health or to maintain my health. I don't know what it is but it's like a mental block when I try to understand my health situations and how problematic some of my problems can be about my health. I feel helpless sometimes when I ask the doctor to repeat whats been said to me for the third time but slower. Filling out my forms aren't hard but confusing at times.
-1	When making health decisions I make sure to read over what my doctor has said to me den I have some take a look at it also so I no that there is nothing I missed 
-1	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to a moderate degree. I think this is due to internet access and doctors making efforts for their services to be more accessible for patients. I do have some difficulty in having a few options and making the best decision out of those and seek guidance from a health professional or online.
1	I'm not dim, nor am I senile. I can understand very well what I need to, and I have a help line that I can call twenty four hours a day. Plus there is always  the internet at my disposal anytime I need to find information.
-1	I feel somewhat confident in my ability to obtain information, however, processing and understanding it can be difficult. Oftentimes, I like to have someone with me (e.g., my husband) at my appointments with me to make sure I am properly taking in everything I need to know. When I am on my own, I have left appointments several times realizing I don't fully remember everything or perhaps have forgotten to ask certain questions.
-1	I feel very confident that I can understand basic health information. I haven't had any recent issues or bad experiences with understanding medical information nor have I had any issues in the past. This includes issues for myself and both of my parents who have also had their share of issues. 
1	I have the capacity to use the internet, with which I prepare myself ahead of any physician visit. And after each one. I have good physicians but they don't always give information, and I like to understand things.I also know I am my own advocate. I feel fairly empowered.
-1	With the Internet it is easy to do research and become familiar with basic health information; while it isn't always accurate, it helps me become more informed and able to ask questions.  I can understand the basics and I make a list of questions to review with the professionals.

The only times I have difficulty with this are when I have questions about procedures, terminology, and timelines regarding certain conditions, procedures, etc. The ability to make appropriate health decisions is very important for me to be able to do. If I do have difficulty obtaining, process, or understanding any health information, I make sure to ask lots of questions and get my concerns addressed.
-1	I think I have a reasonable understanding of what it means to make healthy life choices. I understand the requirements involved and am willing to remain compliant.  It also helps that my mom is an RN.
-1	i have the proper knowledge to understand majority of the things i dicuss with my healtcare provider.  There are alot of terms i am familar with and others i am not but i am very comfortable to speak with medical providers. Im not as lost as most ppl that's not familiar with the terminology.
-1	I feel that I do have an adequate ability to understand what treatments that my doctor recommends, because I am so interested in recovering. But when the doctor starts to talk about potential complications, interactions between medicines, or the 10 year road to recovery ahead, I am melancholy and I do not feel that I am able to process the information that I receive in an appropriate manner, especially given my dire medical situation. 
-1	good understanding Understanding is a psychological process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message whereby one is able to think about it and use concepts to deal adequately with that object. Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of knowledge that are sufficient to support intelligent behavior
1	I completely believe I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information! By using your brain to complete these tasks it becomes very easy!
-1	I Fell I have a good amount of capacity to to make appropriate health decisions but would not want to to so all by myself. Medical information, options, trust in some in the medical field and the overwhelming amount of information/misinformation available these days has me always questing and I find it difficult to make decisions that I am comfortable with 100%.
-1	I believe that I can understand most information and what I don't understand I look up on the internet. I use several different resources to make sure that the information is the same across the board. I also talk with the nurse at the clinic if I don't find the information I need.
-1	I think i can understand it somewhat however somwtimes whe the doctor is talking to me i really do not know what they are saying or taking about 
-1	I read the bottle labels to understand what is asked of me when i take the medications that i have.I have a bit of understanding from previous medications that i have taking in the pass because it seems like all medications are close the the same 
-1	Overall I feel I have the capacity to be able to obtain, process and understand my basic health information and services because my mind is still very sharp. I am of sound mind and body. I am able to make other important decisions in my life so I feel I am totally capable of making health decisions. 
-1	I do feel like I can understand it all to a point. I went to school for biology and chemistry so I understand the deeper aspects but sometimes I just don't feel like my doctor understands. He is so busy. I haven't been to a doctor in a while. I do feel like I can understand information though to an extent and anything I don't, my mother will help me out with. I can make solid health decisions and have been. 
-1	I feel that I have full capabilities to understand, process, and follow through with any information needed on health decisions. I always end up knowing more information than most nurses most of the time.
-1	I feel I am pretty good at understanding the information I have been given.  I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have also had major ankle surgery so there are times when I am not sure on a specific topic or instructions.  
-1	I feel that I am more than capable when I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  If I am unable to understand something, I will ask for help whether it be from someone else or a medical profession.  Given the right circumstance, I may research it as well.
1	I'm usually able to fill out all forms without problems, but a term used might make the question a little ambiguous. When that happens, I'll ask someone at the desk what it is asking for to be sure I'm filling it out correctly. Usually when I see my doctor for a yearly checkup and lab tests, we can chat a little about results, whether I need to do anything, and if there is something I want to being up or ask about. My doctor is very busy, but she does seem to want to answer my questions and is a good listener. I know that most of what I might be concerned about isn't a problem, so I don't bring up everything because it would probably be a waste of time. If something happens where I am sick, I can just make another appointment. My doctor uses easy to understand language gives me options when the advice is appropriate. I feel like I am part of the process, but I trust her judgement when it comes to giving me good health advice.
-1	I work in the health care field and Iâve had 9 surgeries so I have a pretty good understanding of what medical terminology means and I know how to obtain my information and my records.
-1	I believe I am capable of understanding the information that my doctors talk to me about. I always make sure to ask questions and sometimes I'll even write down questions ahead of time before the appt to make sure I don't forget.  There does always seem to be some things that are more difficult to understand just because some doctors do not take their time to make sure that we really know what he's saying to us. 
-1	I feel I have a pretty good capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I would say I am confident in this area about 85% of the time. Sometimes I need some assistance from other health care workers or more information before making a decision. Usually, in these cases, I am able to get the help I need.
-1	I am fairly confident in my ability to understand what I am told by medical professionals. However, sometimes I am bad at thinking of appropriate questions in the moment, such as clarifying questions about what I am told. I also need to put a lot of effort into being organized before an appointment in order to make sure I say everything I need to about my symptoms. When it comes to written documents I am giving after an appointment explaining my diagnosis, I am generally confident in my ability to understand, and that anything unclear is easily researched online if not.
-1	Basic health information is pretty straight forward in my opinion. The doctors and nurses do their jobs perfectly well, and help me as a patient understand my options, and whatever else seems to be going on. There could be some ways that hospitals could improve upon their services such as having online forms in order to fill out information before hand which would make it much easier to get serviced quickly. Most of the time I can understand, and process the diagnoses that I have been given, and with the help of online resources the doctors job is not as necessary to explain in detail if I don't understand something or have questions I can quickly look it up and if I am still confused I can contact my doctor in order for he she to clear things up for me.
-1	I can read but it's hard for me to concentrate on what I am reading so I usually have to read a sentence three times. I'm not good at asking questions, I have a predisposition of not wanting to impose on people. 
-1	I feel like I can communicate with a doctor about any health problems I might have, but my issue comes in with trying to understand everything.  Also sometimes you get materials that you can take home with you to read, and I feel like those materials just make me more confused.  So while, I may not understand everything, hopefully the doctor knows enough to properly evaluate and treat me.
1	I think I have a fairly decent understanding of basic health information and services to make appropriate decisions. If there is ever something that I do not understand someone is always around to get the correct information. 
1	I feel like there are enough resources out there to gain the information needed if I don't know something. I can search something on the internet, or ask qualified staff in person. If it's basic health information, I feel like I should have no problem understanding it.
-1	I am not very proffesional when it comes to health issues. I am very sensitive to get included in this situations.
-1	I feel I am capable of understanding basic health information, especially if the doctors take it down to layman's terms. I search the internet when I don't know certain things
1	I feel that I have the capacity to fully understand the information that doctors or nurses relay to me. If I don't understand or I need to obtain additional information I understand how to acquire it.
-1	I feel that I have a decent grasp on basic health information. I can usually understand what my doctor is saying or asking me. However, I tend not to ask enough questions because I often forget what I wanted to ask once I see the doctor. 
1	I am very confident. When I think I need additional information, which is frequent, I look it up. That does not mean I randomly Google and look for confirmatory statements on websites of dubious quality. I am always ready to give the medical professional the benefit of greater education and experience if I have come to an incorrect conclusion about my condition or medical needs.
1	I feel I am more than capable to do these things.  I am certainly intelligent enough to process and understand basic health information, and I make my own health decisions on a regular basis, as well as decisions regarding my children. I don't visit hospitals that often, however.  
-1	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can figure things out by simply googling them or having someone who has been in my position explain certain things to me to make sure I understand what is going on. I am pretty on top of my health and am healthy to begin with so it isn't too difficult to keep it all straight. The only issues I really have is remembering my family medical history. That kind of messes me up in terms of telling doctors what is determined by my genetics, etc but for the most part I can understand basic health information.
1	I feel that I have the capability to understand the written material that is given to me when I go to the doctor. Although there are a very few times that I don't understand but I seek help, usually at the front desk of the doctors office and they explain to me in detail. It is very important to me that I understand all the medical papers about my health because I want to make sure I take the correct measures in case of an illness. I would not want to misunderstand and later on deal with a worse health issue. I would rather ask even if it means asking a lot of questions.
-1	For the most part, I feel like I have the capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the given information and external resources; however, the glut of resources available (between internet resources, studies, constant barrage of news, etc.) can make decisions more difficult. I feel this is further compounded by the general distrust of healthcare providers as of late due to news coverage, dealing with cost of services and insurance coverage, and the volume of patients versus the number of healthcare professionals to allow adequate time to get the information that one needs. These details increase the skepticism I have for specific diagnoses and treatments as it can be hard to tell if a course of action is necessary or if it is just a profit center for the doctor/hospital prescribing the treatments or diagnostics.
1	I have a solid understanding of basic information needed to make good decisions. If there is something I don't understand, I ask or do research to make sure that I do understand or can at least form good questions to get the information I need. I have had 4 surgeries, 3 of them major, and my doctors were happy to answer the questions I had and explained everything in detail as I requested.
1	I understand most forms, occasionally i don't understand whats being asked of me. I normally understand what doctors are telling me as long as its in lamens terms.
1	I am a former medical school faculty in biochemistry. I helped teach and train doctors. I can listen to, converse, and understand medical jargon. As a former biomedical researcher, I often know more about the molecular mechanism of disease than many of the doctors I associate with, and I have no trouble asking questions and hearing recommendations.
-1	I feel as though I have the capacity to understand basic health information. For the most part doctors I have been to speak in la miens terms so it is not difficult to understand.
-1	I feel that I am able to get the information that I need about my health when I need it because my doctors are easy to talk to and understand me when I ask for  help. They make sure to talk to me in words that I understand and make sure that they ask me questions before I leave them so that I do know what is going on before I leave the room. 
1	I believe that I have the capacity to understand and obtain basic health information.  I do sometimes have issues understanding a doctor when they explain a diagnosis, and I ask questions, but often when I get home, I think of more questions that I need to ask.
1	I write down symptoms on a piece of paper. I give the paper to my doctor.  I research online for matters related to my health issues.
1	I feel that I can understand most thing told to me by my doctor. Sometimes I do forget to ask questions that I wanted to ask. For the most part I am happy with my doctor explaining things so that I understand everything.
-1	I am pretty well versed in reading medical documents and understanding what my doctor and nurse have to say.  If I don't I know what questions to ask.  I understand all of my medications with the side effects and all treatments that are proposed to me.
1	I feel confident in my ability to process most basic health information. I do consult the internet often if I have questions.
1	I am able to understand just about all of the information I need to make appropriate medical decisions.  I ask a lot of questions if needed and also research information about any medical subject that I am interested in.  Again, if there is something that I don't understand I feel comfortable asking someone who I know will be able to answer my questions.  I read all information that is given to me regarding my health status.  
1	I have full knowledge in basic health information. I have a degree in a healthcare field so I do not have to ask tons of questions at appointments.  
1	I usually have no problem understanding what I am told. If I need to, I can usually get the doctor to explain it to me in a way that I understand. The doctors I have had are usually really good at explaining things in a way that I understand, so I rarely have trouble with any information.
1	In general, I believe I have the capability of processing my health issues accurately. The only thing that needs to be worked on is my willingness to speak up if something is unclear, or if I just don't want to feel like I am talking too much. I may miss out on needed information that way.
-1	I have some issues understanding some things, hospitals and doctors give me bad anxiety so that makes the problem much worse. I can almost always get the information I need from a doctor or nurse and if I can't get it from them I use google or ask my mom. I feel I am very capable to get the information I need but I sometimes have a hard time understanding it, that is where I always make sure to have someone explain it to me.
1	Being an adult of reasonable intelligence, I feel I'm able to comprehend much of the information I receive from health care providers and I'm fairly comfortable asking for clarification on concepts I'm unfamiliar with. I have a firm grasp of the English language and solid reading comprehension skills. This makes it relatively easy for me to understand written materials.
-1	I do feel i am capable of understanding basic medical information provided to me. Hospitals are very scary in my opinion but i believe doctors are really good at breaking down information and explaining things. Also refering you on topics to research to get further information.
1	I feel that I am able to deal with medical situations and information well in the vast majority of situations. Anything out of the ordinary simple needs to be asked about and I am confident enough to do so when I am unsure. I feel that I am better than average at making appropriate health decisions based on the criteria. 
-1	I am confident that I am very capable to process basic health information to make the best health decisions for me since I know all about my body ever since I have been frequently visiting my personal doctor whenever the time is needed.

1	I feel that i have all of the resources I need in order to obtain information regarding my health, and understand what is told to me. 
-1	Generally doctors just need enough information to know whats wrong with you so that they can help you as best they can, but it is pretty easy to know what is wrong with yourself and maybe a doctor isnt necessary. I have pretty easy access and I've been through lots of doctors, but I usually just use them as a second opinion.
-1	Regarding the information that I obtain from medical staff I usually understand the process I will be foregoing and I understand health information. Being I have heart issues that are chronic I try to listen very carefully.
1	I've looked up most of the conditions I've had in the past, and the unfamiliar terminology. So when a doctor or a nurse is explaining things to me about it, I'm sort of familiar with what they're saying and if I'm not I ask my brother-in-law who is a doctor.
1	I feel comfortable making these decisions because i ive been doing this since i started going to all my dentist and doctor appointments on my own since I was 18. After going by myself I've done research on my own and use recommendations from family and friends 
-1	I know that I have to ask more questions to understand the information given to me by my doctor.  I don't always advicate for myself
-1	based on my prior experiences with doctors, hospitals and clinics that I can make  informed decisions regarding basic health information and services.
-1	Yes, I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  When there have been times I have not understood, I always asked questions in order to understand more.  I feel like I have researched enough medical information or asked nurse/doctor friends enough questions to know and understand basic health services.
-1	I feel totally able to make decisions for myself and feel that I have an above average understanding of medical issues since I was employed in healthcare for 25 years. In addition I have always been interested in the subject of healthcare. However, I do not like to go to doctors and rarely go unless it's an emergency.
1	I can understand most all medical information and decisions on my own. I am usually the one that helps others to understand information.
-1	I feel fairly confident in asking doctors, physicians, and nurses about anything that I'm unsure of when I'm receiving medical care. I think of medical staff as partners in my journey to retain good health, so i feel it's necessary to ask clarifying questions and to make sure I'm fully aware of everything that's happening with my health.
1	I feel as though I have the capability to understand basic health information. I know that I have a right to know things about my medical needs and that there is no shame in asking for help.
-1	"When I go to the doctor for something more complex than a cold, I always make sure to prepare questions ahead of time. I also usually bring a notebook so that I can write down the answers and do further ""research"" or ask follow up questions if needed"
1	I think to a high degree. Not only am I assertive about getting information from the health professionals that I deal with but I have the greatest library on earth, the internet, at my fingertips. In addition I am a very good reader, so I am rarely confused by written information.
-1	I think that I am fairly able to do this all by myself. I think I am capable to ask the needed questions. I would need very little or no assistance to get the information that I need.
1	I feel confident that if I'm comfortable (meaning they're helpful and nice) with the doctor/nurse that I will ask all of the questions necessary and make sure they explain it to me in terms I can understand. Usually with paperwork, if I'm confused by something, I will always ask for assistance from a receptionist, etc. 
1	I think I am able to process materials very well, to obtain I have to be very self confident and some what pushy to get the answers I want or need,  some times I feel I give to much information and that they don't want to listen to but I would rather they have a complete picture.
1	I have been through some major surgeries, and have some chronic health conditions that I have been dealing with for many years.  When these conditions first arose, having no previous knowledge of most of the information that was given to me, it was somewhat daunting to try to understand everything presented to me. I had excellent providers then, and all the information that I needed was provided by someone in the process.  Currently, I feel that I am experienced in these situations now to know enough about my situation.  I  also remain very confident in the information provided to me by professionals.
-1	I don't go to the doctor very often but when I do, I feel confident that I can understand basic health information and when I don't fully understand something, I can usually do some research on my own to better understand it.
-1	I think I do a pretty good job of obtaining, understanding, and processing the information presented to me by medical professionals. I try to ask questions to ensure I understand, though sometimes I do find myself regretting that I didn't ask certain questions or forgot to after the encounter is over with.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to ask questions and get the necessary information I need for my health.  I am good at asking questions.  I am good at asking specific questions to get to the root of my issue.
-1	I ask many questions during the office visits. Then followup with phone calls to doctor or his staff if needed after doing additional research. I often will seek second opinions on more serious medical issues. 
1	I have a biology background, so I can understand what is going on most of the time. In fact, I often feel like the doctor knows less about me than I do. I try to explain what is going on in detail so the doctor knows.
-1	I feel that I am confident that I can get basic health information.  I think if I can't get the answers by asking questions I can look in other areas to learn the information.  
-1	I feel that I have the ability to process the information that they are giving me. I like to get stuff in writing as well so I am able to refer back to what was said to me at a later time. Having the information in writing also helps me to do some research on the topics when I am at home after the appointment. I will also ask questions in person whenever possible so that they can explain things further 
-1	I feel that my capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information give me to me is good.  Sometimes, I helps to have another person read the information and explain some uncertain points. 
-1	Generally speaking, health documents are intimidating to approach but are understandable through repeated readings; furthermore, assistance is generally available if needed. I feel any decision related to health concerns are met with enough understanding to be properly accessed.
-1	If I go online and do my own research I feel that I can get answers. I don't feel like doctors, nurses, or pharmacist are able to answer questions. I have had many cases where I've been told things I have discovered to be inaccurate or simply not true. Doctors/nurses/pharmacist often repeat to you what they have read or been told. I can read it for myself online first hand.
1	I have a scientific background and rarely have trouble understanding information or instructions given by medical professionals.   Hopefully this helps in asking the right questions.
-1	I feel I have a very good grasp on my capacity to understand my basic health information. I have always felt that I've made appropriate health decisions given my health status. My doctors and psychologist all agree that I should attempt the way i choose to treat myself and if I need further help, they have offered to be of assistance if I require it.
-1	 I think I can understand most of the required information. For the stuff I don't understand, even if a doctor or nurse fails to answer my question adequately I can look up information on the internet. So, overall, I think I have high capacity to comprehend such information.
-1	I feel that I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand different basic health information. Most of the hospital staff that have helped me in my lifetime have done a great job at explaining things to me. Almost all have been attentive and gone into further detail when I inquired about further explanation or detail. 
1	I believe I take my health seriously, and that I have the resources and knowledge to understand all the basic facets of health information. I am able to make decisions about my health, and ask questions clarifying anything that I need more elaboration on. It is not difficult for me to research health information either. 
1	I believe i can process almost all medical information that is relayed to me from medical professionals including doctors and nurses.  I can understand what is told to me, and I can give and solicit medical information during doctor visits.
-1	I think I can obtain the information I need. My issues are when they use medical terms that people outside of the field donât understand. Googling the term doesnât always work as some terms have contextual meaning. 
1	I am always quite confident in my own ability to either find the necessary answers or ask for help when it comes to health. I have had to make doctors and nurses re-iterate things or clarify but there isn't anything more important than your health so I make sure to ask anything i need no matter how dumb i feel.
1	I feel like I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I know how to read information given to me by doctors and nurses, and if I need any help, I know who to ask.
-1	I feel that as a college graduate with a biomedical degree I'd like to think I'm pretty capable of the above, obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I think my ignorance is in the wording of some things, especially on forms as was mentioned earlier. 
1	I feel confident in obtaining and processing basic medical information for myself. I do not have trouble understanding my doctors. I do not always agree with my doctors,but I am able to understand what they are telling me. 
1	I feel very confident in my ability to understand medical information.  I have never had a problem doing this task in the past and would not anticipate having it in the future either.  I have taken some basic health classes and have a good general idea of the medical field, including insurance, etc...
1	I feel sometimes like I am not taken seriously by doctors. I suffer from chronic migraines and fatigue. Whenever I have brought this up with any doctor, the story is always the same: they write it off as just a lack of something in my lifestyle, maybe give me something which only barely helps, and send me on my way. I may not be the healthiest person, but I know when something's wrong with me. I wasn't always this way. I rarely ever had migraines before I went through puberty. Even then, I had more energy, but after I was in a car accident things got a lot worse for me.
1	I have had a few medical issues since I was born, and am fairly accustomed to medical forms and medication instructions.  Also, my mother is a nurse and works interviewing patients, and I have learned a bit from her about how hospitals and the medical industry work.  I feel like this makes me capable of understanding most information presented to me by my doctor.
-1	I am not afraid to ask questions when I'm uncertain about a medical situation so while I may not understand right away, I will get answers. In addition to asking a medical professional, I go to as many resources as I can to find out about the condition. That said, I would say I'm slightly above average in terms of understanding basic health information.
-1	I feel I am capable to read and understand health informaton and if I cant understand the health information I can ask my husband doctor or pharmacist to help me understand the situation at hand. 
1	I believe I have a higher capacity to get and understand basic health information and services because I have a degree in Health Information Management and I have worked in the medical insurance and billing fields for several years.  Some of the information can be hard to comprehend when dealing with foreign accents or the complexity of the issue, but can normally be understood after asking additional questions.
1	I feel I can obtain and understand all basic health information and services needed. I can make my own decisions about healthcare services, and sometimes it is not what the doctor recommends.
-1	I feel like I understand most of what they are saying but sometimes the terminology they use or their writing is not able to be understood by most people including myself.  They sometimes need clarification.
-1	I feel that if it is explained to me simply I can easily understand what is being said. I can also ask all the questions that I need to ask in order to get the answers that I need. 
1	I feel that I have a pretty good ability and capacity for these things. I can understand most of it and if I don't I can find someone who can. Sometimes it is a bit hard to find someone but I make sure that I do. 
-1	I think i have a fair degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I feel that i am old enough to make decisions on my own and i believe and trust in God in everything i do and decide.
1	I feel that i have the ability to understand basic health information. I am usualy very healthy except when i am pregnant That's when issues tart. When I receive information from a doctor or nurse that something may be wrong, I try to ask all the questions that come to my mind. If i forget, I write them down. My uncle was a nurse before he retired so he is always there for me to assist with making health decisions. I feel that i am capable of making the right decisions for myself and my family.
-1	I would say I can understand the majority of the information given to me by my doctor and do occasionally need further explanations and advice when making a decision. Often times some forms aren't written well or are not as understandable as others and give me a hard time when filling them out. The use of medical jargon also confuses me sometimes when filling out paper work and when my doctor explains my results or condition.
-1	"I feel I am fully enabled to understand basic health information, as I I am extremely literate and studied in medical conditions, including scientific terminology. This knowledge base is self-pursued rather than academic. I also do not worry about asking ""stupid"" questions to medical professionals."
-1	I have a good general knowledge of medical procedures, medications and facts.  However, there are occasionally topics that I'm sure I know something about that I'm wrong on.  Because of this, when I'm interacting with my doctors, nurses and pharmacists I will clarify by repeating what they said to me to make sure. If I'm unsure I'll ask for more information. If I'm not at the office or pharmacy and I'm unsure about info I've called the doctor's office (or pharmacy) and asked for clarification.  Just last week I called the nurse online to help me decide whether or not to take my son to urgent care.  It was very helpful. 
-1	I feel that my education which included anatomy, first aid, and a health course perhaps puts me on a slightly higher pedestal than an average person. I know a fair bit of terminology, symptoms, solutions, and of how the body works, but I am by no means an expert. The bureaucratic portion of the forms needed at doctor's offices were done by my guardian until I was 19. Because of this I feel that I have had very little time exposed to them, and as such need extra help usually on one or two sections, never the whole thing however. I feel it is harder to obtain than to process and understand as many doctors are very busy.
1	I think that my skills in getting and processing this information is fairly good or at least as good as the average non-medical expert.
1	I believe I have the full capacity to obtain, process and understand health information and services. I am able to search for information I don't understand or ask to assistance in having it explained to me.
-1	I try to think logically when talking with my doctor. I ask myself what information will be most useful when explaining my problem and what I'm expecting to get from the doctor. I make sure to ask questions I have even if some questions might be common sense.
1	It's simple, whether it's the doctor, dentist, therapist, or anyone else, I follow a policy of never agreeing to procedure unless I feel like I completely understand it first. So if they can't answer all my questions satisfyingly, I say no.
1	When I have a medical issue, or even just during check-ups, I always speak to the nurse, aid, tech, and doctor about any issues that I've had (in the past) and recently/currently. I feel like since I have a background in both being around and studying medicine, I am aptly suited to have conversations about a large range of medical topics. Even at home, I can easily obtain basic outline information about symptoms I'm having. Due to my understanding of medical terminology, I feel I am able to process and understand many of the terms and even come to comprehensive conclusions about issues. If a doctor explains something to me, I am usually able to process quite a bit of the information, and if I don't quite understand or if it's new to me, I am willing to ask them to explain it to me more or in a different way. 
-1	When I was insured, I generally felt like I did; I could ask my doctor to elaborate about particular health related concerns and follow his advice. Now, though, I can't afford insurance, and I cannot afford to see a doctor in any capacity, so any health information I need has to come from the Internet. I can't get anything from a face-to-face conversation with a medical professional.
1	I feel that I can obtain, process and understand my basic health information very adequately. I ask questions if I am not sure what a doctor/nurse is saying, and I read through the materials they give me. I feel competent to make my health decisions. 
-1	I recently had surgery and I felt like after every appointment (which were significant, including MRIs, physical therapists, anesthesiologists) I had to Google everything that was told to me. I would forget what I should ask when I was in the room, because I was too busy trying to process what the doctor or nurse was telling me. I know they're busy people but I wish I had more time to process and then ask questions.
-1	I feel that I understand basic health information to a pretty good extent. I usually only go to the hospital when it is completely necessary. The only other times I go to the doctor is for my routine check-ups. Things like flus/stomach bugs/general sickness/etc I can handle on my own and do at my house with over the counter drugs. I have a good grasp of what makes my body sick and how to take care of it.
-1	i feel that i have a high capacity to understand all basic health information and services. any time i'm sick i understand what the doctor and nurse tell me. anything i need help with i'll look up online or ask someone.
1	I'm pretty smart in things so I feel pretty confident that I understand and can figure out what something is saying or what someone is saying to me.  I'm also very level headed so my logic is also pretty sound.  It really helps me when determining what course of action to take in life so I feel very confident in my ability to handle these situs
-1	I feel ok in most instances when it comes to my health and any health related questions I may have.  Generally I ask the upfront questions of my medical care people but then I also rely on research i do myself to fill out that information when I have questions.  It's sometimes frustrating having to wait on test results and, generally, I feel,that's where the communication breaks down between patient & doctor.  Every time I ask 'When will X be ready?'  I get the answer that goes from tomorrow to next week with no definitive time line and that is incredibly frustrating to me.
1	I feel like I understand the information given to me very well. I want to be a lawyer, so I have no problem understanding official documents. Additionally, I have lots of doctors in my friends and family, so I have plenty of people to ask when I have problems understanding information.
-1	A lot of the time I don't quite understand what doctors and nurses are saying about certain things. When it comes to basic health decisions, I can usually make the decision, but a lot of the time I just want the doctor to tell me what to do. If I'm unable to understand something and the doctor and nurses weren't helpful I usually ask my sister, who is a nurse.
-1	Often I find myself seeking medical attention for recurring issues. I often spend time on my own (out of curiosity) reading about these conditions I have been diagnosed with. I regards to basic health information I usually have enough knowledge to understand what is being relayed to me.  
-1	I feel confident in making decisions as well as asking questions of my doctors about any and all items related to my health.  I believe I feel this way due to the fact that I was caregiver for both my parents and had to learn what and how to ask questions early on.  Given that I had over 15 years of experience with my parents and their doctors it gives me the confidence that I need now to take care of myself when needed and to ask the questions that I feel I need to have answered.  
-1	Yes, I guess so. Basic information is no problem. Basic information about my health issues is easy to understand. But health issues don't fit neatly into the basic information. I think I need more than the basic information to make decisions. 
1	I feel that I have the capacity to process and understand basic health information. I choose medical providers that are good at communicating things to me and do not get mad or annoyed when I ask questions. I feel that if I am paying a doctor for medical care, they should be happy to answer my questions.
-1	I feel I have a very basic ability to understand basic health information, I find it easier to understand when layman's terms are used and not medical jargon, and if the writing is not very small, the fine print is too difficult to read.
-1	As a type 1 diabetic with a diagnosed learning disability I have spent a great deal of time getting medical documents transcribed to me. Thankfully my wife who is a social worker and deals with medications in her field is always able to help me. 
-1	I feel as if I do have the ability to retain information given to me about my medical conditions. I ask frequent questions, and also do research on my own. Any questions that I have I feel completely fine bringing up with my doctors and they are wonderfully helpful. 
1	I think I have all the means necessary to get my questions answered. I can google anything and I'm not afraid to ask a million questions if that's what it takes to understand the condition or issue. 
-1	Somewhat. I generally know where to look and have some decent knowledge of it, but often it seems that the information requires you to already know quite a bit about medicine or human biology to be able to understand it.
-1	I'm confident that I can find the answers to things that I might not understand. The Mayo Clinic website provides a wealth of information that helps me understand anything that I have questions about.
-1	I think I have the ability to process basic health information. I am not an expert by any means but since I have not had health insurance for 10 years, I've had to rely on my own research top determine my ailments. Apart from that, I've done my own research about medicines and read news about the latest things going on in the science world.
-1	I feel like I've usually understood what I've been given. I don't have much experience. Nowadays, my brother's girlfriend is a doctor, so if I had any major questions, I could ask her. 
1	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand information to make health decisions.  If I don't understand something, I usually ask the doctor to further explain, and if I have more questions after I leave the doctor, I will do further research on my own.  I have done this in regards to my children's and my husband's health as well as my parents health concerns to further understand their problems.
-1	I feel like I do have the capacity to understand. I do feel however that health practitioners don't assess me on an individual level. I have a long history of being medically different,  certain tests and advice are not applicable to me. I have taken medicine that has opposite side effects on me not disclosed on the medicine brochure. Doctors usually don't believe the side effects I explain to have. 
-1	I believe that I do have the ability to obtain process and understand basic information, but sometimes the way it is conveyed is difficult to understand, and they use too many âdoctorâ terms that normal people do not understand.
-1	as far as I'm concerned I have enough ability to ascertain and digest the medical information provided to me unless I am not as sharp as I think, but then I normally ask my wife for help on hard to understand information.
1	I feel like I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. The health professionals I've always had ask me if I don't understand something. I can also call them if I have questions later on.
1	I feel that I have a complete capacity to understand and obtain health information about myself. I have a BS in biology, pre-med. I am not senile and I can read and understand English veryl.
-1	I feel that I am competent when it comes to getting the appropriate amount of medical information. I often come up with questions to ask my doctors before my appointments, so that I don't forget. I'm comfortable with asking follow up questions, and reading and processing new information that's given to me. I also feel confident about researching and reading more information about concepts or diagnoses that are unfamiliar to me.
1	I feel capable of understanding the information needed to proceed in any cases. Basic health decisions and stuff like that. If you are in doubt just ask someone so you can take the best option
-1	I believe I am very capable to get and understand medical information. Although, I sometimes get overwhelmed due to anxiety and it makes it difficult to focus my thoughts and sometimes it affects my vision (blurred).
-1	I have a medical administrative background so i am familiar with most medical terms and situations. It is very rare that I need someone to explain basic health information to me because I have the resources to find any information I need. 
1	I feel like I am fully capable of reading and understanding what is being told to me about my health, but sometimes cost prevents me from getting all the treatment I feel I need or desire. I think I don't always have the funds to obtain the treatment and information I need.
-1	I feel that I have the ability to process and understand the basics but the details are often confusing. I have a close friend who is a nurse and she helps quite a bit.
-1	I would say for most basic health related information and services, I can grasp it if I take time to read through it and have a way to ask questions if needed.
1	I have an undergrad degree in biology and several family members in the medical field (1 doctor, many nurses, 2 respiratory therapists), so I feel confident that I could either understand it on my own or ask them for help,
-1	I find myself more than adequately intelligent to understand most scientific/biological issues, but the problem lies in the paperwork. I'm never certain as to how to fill it out correctly. The only time I go to see a medical professional is in an emergency due to my lack of financial resources, so it's very intimidating to be VERY ill and be slammed with unfamiliar paperwork.
1	I believe that I have the ability to understand the basic health information needed to make good health decisions. If I do not understand right away, I can ask questions or look up the information online.
-1	I believe that for the most part I can understand any basic health information so long as it is explained to be correctly. Anything I fail to fully understand I can look up the information myself until I get it correct.
-1	It really depends on who is speaking and how they are approaching me. If they are rushing I will miss everything. Sometimes when everything is translated in me it sounds like jargon. Mostly because I am anxious and cant think clearly. 
-1	I feel like a lot of doctors don't listen and just brush you off. I understand basic information but if I need more detail, they act like they don't care or have time to explain. I am going to try to get pregnant soon and my OBGYN just brushed me aside when I had concerns about not having a period after being off the pill for 6 months.  That's a big deal! hello???
1	At this point in my life, I believe that I have all the skills that I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I believe that having three kids has given me an advantage of being able to understand health information more. I was a stay at home mom for a long time so I was the main parent that was in charge of taking my kids to the doctor and taking care of them. If it's something basic, I know that there are resources online that I can easily access to find quick remedies to certain ailments or injuries. I also know that there are phone numbers that I can easily call for more serious conditions like being poisoned by some kind of liquid or being bit by a poisonous animal.
1	I think I am fully capable of understanding basic health information.  I often think of questions in advance so I remember to ask them. On occasion I think of a question after the fact that I wish I could know the answer to.
-1	From all the questions that i have answered i feel like i have some good capacity to understand basic health problems and i can figure out health information to a bit extent
-1	I'm confident that I'm able to understand basic or even complex health information provided to me, as well as information regarding health or other services.
-1	I feel that I am fairly competent when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. I have had a chronic illness since I was a child and spent several of my teenage years very ill. It took several years for doctors to realize what was wrong with me so I spent a lot of time doing research of my own, asking questions, and learning about my health and my condition. My mother has also had lupus my entire life and as a child I was educated very well on that and how her condition was treated and I often went to the doctor and hospital with her.
-1	i feel that I have at least an average capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I've never had a major issue attempting to process said information, and any minor issue has been quickly resolved. 
-1	I think I have the capacity to understand most things that are related to my health. If I do not understand something, I also have the capacity to seek out extra information through sources available to me. I sometimes feel a little nervous about asking doctors questions because I almost feel like I should know what something means if they tell me.
-1	I don't have problems reading or understanding the information given to me by health practitioners. Sometimes I may read up on a condition etc on the internet for a better understanding if I still need more answers. 
-1	I think for the most part I can handle basic health interactions. I rarely have trouble filling out the questionnaires, but I don't always remember questions I have for the doctor until I'm back at home. I think especially when they catch me off guard or there is a problem that is discovered, my mind sometimes blanks and I just don't have time to process that information and think of questions until later.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information however my problem is I get extremely nervous at the doctors office. Many times I won't speak up to ask him questions.  I often think of questions after I've left the appointment which I usually look up on Google to find the answers.
-1	I am very capable to understand all that is properly explained to me.  I am not that familiar with many medical terms but if they are properly explained, I understand.
1	I feel well within my ability to process medical and health information as I haven't stumbled on any step of the process yet. Getting to this point was fairly seamless from childhood, when my parents would fill out most of the documentation and so on.
-1	"I work in the healthcare industry so I feel that I have adequate knowledge on it. I work with patients and with doctors so I am that ""translator"" for patients that may be confused on medical terminology"
1	In general, I feel I have a sufficient capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information, services needed and make appropriate health decisions. I am comfortable in a relative sense in these situations and also do not have a problem seeking out help/resources if needed.
1	I'm of sound mind, I understand everything that doctors tell me and don't have any problems comprehending any written material I'm given regarding medical conditions. The only problem I might have, and it's new, and a minor one, is trouble reading really tiny print that you might find on medication bottles, or pamphlets, without reading glasses.
-1	I have great capacity in obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services. I think that I am entirely capable in taking care of myself and communicating to my doctor the things that I need to do to maintain my health and safety. I am confident in my abilities.
1	I feel I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and make appropriate health decisions. I am proficient in reading and writing in English and feel I am of high intelligence. I do, however, feel nervous often in medical settings and sometimes avoid asking additional or clarifying questions regarding the information I am receiving. 
-1	Although I do not have a background in health, I feel that have the capacity to fill out health forms, understand health conditions, and process basic health information.  Generally I know enough from the outset, but when I don't am comfortable asking my physician questions, and I think I have a good grasp of the sources that I can trust online.  It's rare that I can't find a good answer to a pertinent health question on the internet.
1	I have dementia but am still fairly high functioning.  I can think things through but have problems remembering so I try to go to appointments with notes that I type up in advance to make sure things don't fall through the cracks.   I can then make handwritten notes as the doctor or nurse answers the pre-typed questions.   The times I run into trouble is when I don't bring / take notes as I can easily forget some of what was said if I count on memory alone.  That is why I prefer to get written information that I can review slowly and refer back to as needed.
1	I have never had a serious issue filling out medical paperwork or dealing with medical staff when I needed information. I don't always think of every relevant question when I'm at a doctor's visit, but if I do have questions after an appointment it is never a problem to phone my doctor's office and ask one of the nurses or have the doctor give me a call back. We also have access to an online interface for asking questions and viewing test results, etc.
-1	I feel that I understand most of the information and forms that are required of me. I take the time to understand what information is needed and anything that they need to know about me, my conditions or any issues. I have a state of mind of getting a task done and filling out any health information.
-1	I feel greatly that I have the capacity to comprehend my health situation. I work in the medical field for a contract research organization and am a cancer survivor. I know what to ask and when, and I know how to translate when I receive. 
1	I am literate and highly educated.  I am able to obtain and comprehend basic health information and services needed to make my own health decisions.  
1	i think i have the capacity to obtain,process,and understand heath information because i will ask a doctor or a nurse, or i will check online for any information i might need to make appropriate health decisions  for myself or any family members.i have not had any problem understand health information in the past. 
-1	I feel that I am intelligent enough to understand enough about health information and services needed to make decisions related to my health. It is things like health insurance that I struggle understanding completely. Sometimes I don't think of proper questions to ask when I'm in the room with my doctor -- it's once I actually leave the room and think about it more that I have additional comments or concerns. 
1	I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. When I'm talking to my doctor and don't understand, I ask questions until I do. Alternatively, I do research on my own as well. 
-1	I believe that I have the capacity to process the basic information that a doctor or a healthcare professional tells me. I do not think a doctor would just leave you blindly, they would help you understand what is going on. And even if they do not give me all of the information I will still have a decent understanding of what is happening to me. I am no where near educated as a doctor is but I have taken quite a few medical classes, such as medical terminology so I have at least a basic understanding of what I would need to know when a doctor is breaking the information down to me.
1	My health is very important to me and so I make sure to ask questions and make sure I fully comprehend everything that is told to me.
1	I think I am able to obtain, process and understand any basic health information needed to make health decisions. I have enough background to understand this kind of information.
1	While I have no specialist knowledge, I an very good at understanding health information.  I come from a family in the medical field so that has helped.  I am also very good with language and have the skills needed to process this information.
-1	I believe i have capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions to a moderate extent. I know i can always look up symptoms and remedies for any health concern online and if it appears more severe i can contact my doctor or a healthcare professional to fully understand and take the correct approach to any issues.
1	I believe I am 100 degrees able to understand, process, and obtain basic health information. I have filled out my own forms for years. And for the last 9 years I have also filled out my children's. I also have my medical office assistant certificate which also helps me. 
-1	I feel very confident in my ability to understand most basic health information and services. My doctor is always good about helping me to understand what is said and I try to write down questions I may have before going to the doctor so I remember them.
1	Yes, I can still understand and process all the health information that my doctor or nurse give to me. If there is something I don't understand, I ask. I know how to use my medical and dental websites and all that entails.
-1	When i am with the doctor or nurse i ask as many questions as i can. I want to know as much as i can know before i leave their office, because when i get home  it is so hard to find accurate information regarding a medical condition. I can look online but the internet has to much or incorrect information. Asking a friend or family member to help is not always the best information and mostly can be biased i think. It almost like every form needs to have an instruction book to come with it.
-1	I feel that I am competent in reading basic health information.  I take an interest in my health so I am fairly versed in general things. 
-1	Both of my parents work in the medical profession and help explain medical terminology if i have a query. I also have google to help explain stuff to me when i'm confused on a certain subject.
-1	I think it depends on the reasons why i'm in the hospital. If it is just a regular check up i usually don't have any problems understanding basic health information. Few month ago i had some issues with my stomach and because i'm not very educated in that sphere i needed more help of the nurse to understand what was wrong with me and why i needed to take the test that i was asked to do 
-1	I am not fully qualified to analyze in depth about the medical topic, but I am able to understand and analyze many basic things about medicine. I have learned all these things throughout my life while I care for other people or even, I learn it when I take care of myself. That's why I consider that I can understand the things that will be discussed in this survey
-1	In general, I feel I have the capacity to obtain and process the info needed to maintain good health.  But I feel like I've had specific instances in my life where I had a medical condition and even after going to more than one doctor, I still didn't know what was wrong or how to solve it and researching things on my own online only added to my confusion.
-1	I feel very accomplished in reading or assessing medical instructions it is just sometimes the professional answers are closed off due to they can not admit or deny what i ask since it is something they are not willing to discuss
1	I feel confident that I will understand basic health information, and ask questions to obtain clarification or additional information.  I have had a serious health scare 8 years ago (cancer) and very much trusted my doctors and nurses to provide me with the needed information.  I felt comfortable asking questions and sharing information.  This in turn has helped me for any future health adventures I might face.
-1	I feel I have a pretty good grasp on doing all the mentioned above in regards to filling out medical information. I usually don't find myself getting stuck very often while filling out forms. There have been a few occasions where I did need assistance though. 
-1	I feel like there is too much information and too many words. The font is also really small with little space to write. I also hate it when I have to rewrite things that I have already written. Why can't it be easier? 
-1	Most times when I go to the Doctor I have to get the Doctor or a nurse to go over any and all paperwork, so I will completely understand all directions from the Doctor.  My health is very important to me and I do not want to leave the office confused about anything that the Doctor has said.
1	I usually have no issue in understanding things told to me by medical personnel. I studied nursing before becoming a teacher so many terms are still identifiable to me. If I don't understand I have no problem asking questions until I fully understand.
-1	I feel that for the most part i can understand what i am being told.  I have problems when it becomes too technical or sometimes when discussing how much insurance will cover vs my responsibility.
-1	I have a lot of experience with doctors as I've had to deal with them when my mother was terminally ill. Sometimes things were hard to understand, but most of the time I was able to understand everything. We had to do all sorts of paperwork and make so many decisions. It was a mess.
1	I am highly literate and not unknowledgable. I usually never have a problem asking questions relevant to my situation or understanding what is being explained to me.
-1	i have full capacity. i understand the basics and anything i do not understand i am confident that i can get someone to explain it to me in further detail. i also have acess to internet to help further
1	I know where to obtain basic health care information and services. This includes forms and documents. I know how to fill out the forms on my own and understand what information the forms are requesting without receiving any help. I'm able to understand forms and documents that provide basic health information and services in order to make informed health decisions that are appropriate for me.
-1	I believe that I have the capacity to understand the majority of things given to me. If not, then I have family that would assist or even looking online for more information. What I find to be confusing is at times, one can get different recommendations or advice from the health field, as in getting a second opinion, etc. I do my best in making healthy choices in my life though.
-1	I think I am extremely competent to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I usually have no problem understanding what doctors and nurses are explaining to me and if I don't I will ask questions to make sure that I have a full understanding.
-1	I believe I have the capacity to understand and complete medical paperwork. Sometimes it is hard to understand what the doctor is trying to tell you because at times it seems like they don't actually listen to all you. Lots of time I'll tell my doctor that have certain symptoms for a certain amount of time then the doctor turns around and says something to make me think he did not listen to me. There are times that he can tell me things and I have no idea what he is talking about because he is using medical terms that I'm not familiar with. Example, I had a full panel blood test and when the results came back in a nurse called to tell me that everything was normal but I had no idea what exactly they are testing for and what it means now that the results were normal. 
1	To a large degree, I feel confident in my capacity to obtain, process, etc. health info. My wife is a registered nurse, and if I ever find myself at a crux, I can rely on her to aid me.
1	I feel like I am very able and comfortable obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, using resources such as my spouse, friends and the internet.
1	I know how to analyze data properly. Also its very basic just listening skills not really much to explain there, so not sure what you are looking for with this. 
-1	I really like my Dr so getting the information I need is pretty easy.  The issue is sometimes remembering everything that was said.  He does give me the results of blood test so that helps. Remembering why and the importance of what he said is the issue.  I can always call the nurse however at any time and get a brief run down on the visit too if needed.  I feel like my Dr knowledge is what helps me make appropriate health decisions.  Plus he breaks it down pretty good.  
1	I understand my medical conditions and have done a lot of research on health issues.  I do research before I even go to a doctor if it seems a new health issue has popped up.  I have also studied medical information and terminology to help out my parents with their medical conditions.  I try to be as informed as possible before any doctor visit.  I have always been able to absorb and understand medical information easily.
-1	I think I have the basic knowledge and understanding to feel fairly competent in comprehending my health situations. I know where to find the resources to make decisions if I need. I could probably be more thorough in my discussion, explanations, and and questioning of health professionals to ensure the highest level of efficient care. I probably make too many assumptions.
1	I feel I am capable to obtain the information I need to make my health decisions the majority of the time.  My mother was a nurse so I was exposed to medical terms at an early age.  I am also a college graduate, English is my native language and i read and comprehend well.
1	Having come from a family that is involved in the medical profession, I know that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I feel that there is sufficient explanation and help sources when it comes to understanding basic health information. The key really is keep it simple. Avoid big medical terms. I will check the internet also before making a decision.
1	Regarding all the questions I just answered, I feel that I have a very high comprehension level to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate Health decisions
1	I feel that the doctors and nurses do a fine job helping me understand, obtain and process my health information. Health care coverage is completely confusing (even for the people providing the coverage), but the actual information and services are always more than sufficient for me to make decisions.
-1	I believe that in my experiences I have not needed much help with the entire experience of going to the doctor and anything related to it. I have been able to understand directions, fill out forms, and ask good questions. 
1	Pretty well. If the doctor tells me something i make sure to keep it in my mind or even write it down. Health is not something to joke about and i have any questions i'm sure to tell him. But overall i understand why i need to take something or do somethin.
1	I have the appropriate knowledge regarding my past health to be able to fill out any and all forms presented to me before and after any appointments. Should I ever have any questions, i do not hesitate to reach out to a nurse for assistance if there is any confusion. 
-1	I believe that I understand most of what the doctor is saying but when it comes to results of blood work or test like the MRI or Cat Scan there is little to no explanation given. I usually have to do additional research online to try and correlate the issues that I have with the test results that are given. The doctor most times comes in and seems rushed. By the time you are on the table, undressed and being poked you have forgotten all the important information that you need to obtain in specific. I have access to my records online so it helps a bit to review and then try to process the information. However, there is much that I do not understand and wish I had more assistance.
1	I have the capacity  to understand this information and services on my own.  An example of a rare time when I would need help would be if I were in the hospital with a high fever or head injury that confuses me.  I would say that I am almost 100 percent capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding the given information alone.
1	I like to think that I am easily able to comprehend a doctors diagnosis. If there was any obvious question that jumps out to me, I always ask it. If anything is unclear I will be sure to have any advice/instruction clarified. On the off chance that I think of a question afterwords, I can usually read up on the subject to gain further understanding. My wife is very often with me and behaves similarly. If I was in a position that I could not fill out paperwork, I am sure she could handle the task.  Lets hope that doesn't happen though.
1	I'm no medical professional, but so far, I've never had to fill out more than basic forms, so I rarely need help with anything.  The only sticking point I've ever had was trying to remember the name of an antibiotic that I've taken before (I didn't know that there was more than one at the time).  When I did find out the name, I couldn't spell it.  Luckily, there was a co-worker with me who studied pharmacy and spelled it without a problem. For the most part, I don't have any problems, though.
-1	I feel relatively well versed in health related matters although I am not in the health profession. I read a lot about health and fitness.
-1	I would say that I do have a pretty decent understanding once something is explained to me. But if I have to make a decision without any knowledge of the subject I struggle. Health insurance especially is very difficult for me to understand.
1	I feel like I am capable of getting the information necessary when visiting a medical professional. Depending on my current physical condition, I may be more prone to ask more questions compared to when I'm feeling very well.
-1	I think I can understand basic health information. I probably can process health information if it is not too complicated, I ask the right questions, and the health provider is willing to give me thorough answers. Obtaining health information is something I can do by researching online, but obtaining health information from a doctor would be difficult without health insurance coverage.
1	I did not always have health insurance, but shortly after Obamacare passed, I went to the private market to get my first health insurance policy. From the information at the website and the documents they sent me after purchasing my policy, I was able to fully comprehend exactly what my policy covered, where I could use it, and more. I've only had to use it once in the 8 years or so since I've had, but I was sure to get my questions asked regarding my policy at my doctor's office and everything went smoothly.
1	I'm an educated woman, and intelligent, so I have a good grasp of basic health and medicine issues and the ability to understand a doctor's explanations.
1	I feel that I am more than equipped and knowledgeable to be able to obtain, process, and understand anything regarding my basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision.  I have been taking care of myself via doctors and health care providers for over a decade and have never had any issues understanding or not knowing who to ask appropriate and valid questions to.  I am comfortable in the medical arena as I have had previous work experience in the medical field and was premed for two years in college before switching my major to business/accounting.
1	I think I have a great capacity to understand basic health information and make appropriate decisions. If I do not understand something I am not shy about asking my provider to explain it in a different way. I am very apt to ask questions or to clarify when things are not clear to me. I also have the internet to look up things I am not so sure about.
-1	With all the changes that occur on a daily basis, I think it is not realistic to expect the public to keep up with what is right or appropriate when it comes to medicine.  I believe I can process the basic information but I know that to do things correctly, the basics do not always take care of everything that we need to know.  Obtaining the right information, now thanks to the internet, is easy to get you just have to make sure that the sites that you go to are reputable. 
-1	I am able to read the information, or listen to the information.  I feel like I can speak up and ask questions about how my diagnosis is related to what I read.  I can fill out needed forms, with a few questions
-1	I feel like I am mostly able to understand basic health information that is given to me. I occasionally feel too intimidated or uncomfortable to ask my doctor certain questions about my health, depending on the provider and the situation. Besides that, I am usually able to obtain the information that I need about my health.
1	I think I have a good capacity to ensure I can understand the information, provide input to my healthcare professionals, and ask the questions I need to in order to make decisions and follow directions when needed. I often have a list of information when I go in, questions I want answered, and other ideas prior to walking in and try not to walk out without feeling comfortable with what I've learned.
1	To the degree that I can reference to other available, public information sources regarding the health information presented to me by doctors and nurses. I'm best at processing and understanding written information when taking the time to perform more research on the information in question.  
-1	I think I obtain at least somewhat of a basic understanding of the health information that was provided to me. I wish there was more explaining however, because they are times where I do not understand what is going on in some aspects of the application.
-1	Health information is very hard to understand and needs to be simplified. They have to remember doctors are not the ones reading the information. Its the patient.
1	This may sound a bit pompous, but I have a fairly easy time understanding health information for two reason. First, I work in healthcare. I have worked in healthcare for 12 years. I'm also just smart. (See? Sounds conceited, but I don't mean it that way.) I am the one that every one of my family and friends come to for medical help or advice. 
1	I have all the knowledge I need.  If there is something I am unsure about I have the resources available to me as I work in the health field.
1	I have the capacity, but sometimes I'm in too much pain to be able to process everything I'm being told.  And doctors don't always tell you what you need to know.  Or they mislead you and talk you into things, including surgeries, that you wish you hadn't agreed to later.  (That's happened to me more than once.)
-1	sometimes it gets tough to cooperate when ready books before going to bed. I need lots of light and a activity around me.
-1	As a patient, I am about 70% confident that I have the capacity to obtain , process and understand basic health information and services needed to make health decisions. I have BA degree and always learn new health information myself, so I am comfortable with my level of capacity.
1	I feel that, within myself, I have more than adequate capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services I need to make appropriate health decisions. Whether or not the information and services are actually available and of a quality that will help is another matter.
-1	I can understand basic health information regarding my diagnosis. I can obtain a basis understanding from pamphlets that I've received from the doctor regarding my specific medical condition. The dialogue between the doctor and I usually does not go further than this because of very limited time constraints. When they had my info over to a staff after a 3 minute discussion, it brings me to square one because the nurses usually aren't there during that part of the conversation.
-1	I have a biology background and a little bit of hospital lab experience.   I feel like this gives me an above average ability to process and understand what doctors are saying and to research.  I will still ask questions though if there is any doubt.
1	I feel very confident with everything involved with my health info and services. I have had a lot of experience with myself and my family. If I do not understand something I will research or ask a health professional to assist me. I have had to make health decisions for myself before.
1	I feel like I have a decent enough grasp of medical terminology and my health conditions that I can make good decisions by myself in consultation with my medical team. I rarely ask for help understanding medical information given to me or filling out forms.
1	I feel that I can make my own decisions up to certain appoint, until I might possibly receive some bad news about my health, then I will turn to my husband to help me make those difficult decisions as to where we go from there. 
1	I feel that I understand most information about health conditions. Sometimes I need more clarification when it comes to the workings of health insurance policies and other related documents. Once it is explained to me semi thoroughly, I have no problem processing and understanding this information though.
1	I feel very confident in my ability to read and understand medical info presented for laypeople. There's a lot of information available in a lot of places and I can usually tell the wheat from the chaff, and when I'm talking to professionals, I know enough to understand or ask about what I do not. 
-1	I can understand basic health information. Only what I do is have a reading of my blood pressure or oxygen. Then I will ask a nurse questions about my reading. What was my reading for my high blood pressure? Is that good or bad? I will ask if my oxygen level is go or not. If it is a little low I will ask what causes it to be low. I try to learn what is good and bad about my health. I also try to learn as much as I can online by looking what I am curious online.
-1	I feel I am great and have a lot of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. Normally the material is written simply and if I don't totally understand I will google for answers or ask my doctor/nurse.
1	I feel that I have a basic understanding of health information.  I am well read and and always seek out more information to give me a better understanding of things.
1	I make lists of symptoms I have when I'm not feeling well as well as a list of questions to ask the doctor or nurse. Very rarely am I unprepared going into an appointment for an ailment or sickness. Today with the internet makes it really easy to prepare as well. You can practically diagnose yourself and also make a list of possible problems to speak to a doctor about.
-1	I FEEL SOMEWHAT LIKELY REGARDING THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN ,PROCESS, AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES NEEDED TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISIONS.
1	In my experience all of the health care professionals I've worked with have done a very good job explaining any relevant information to me, and given me whatever choices are appropriate to my situation. I also have a degree in Biology that maybe helps me further understand some of the general information presented to me about health and anatomy. 
1	I ask questions and read the information I'm given.  I have also talked to friends or relatives that have had the same or similar problems.  I had 1 minor and 3 major surgeries and lot's of tests last year.
-1	I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand health information given to me. If I don't understand anything at all I ask until I get the answer I need. Sometimes I feel like a problem patient because the Dr or Nurse get a bit frustrated but that's their job and my job is to keep track and fully understand my own health as a bottom line. I learned this all the hard way by not asking questions in a previous situation and only became more ill. I think we pay for this information so we should understand it even if we have to go through many people to get it.
1	pretty much completely. Prescription drug information that is written by the manufacture is needlessly complicated as well and the info about clinical trials though.
-1	I think I have a moderate capacity to do this. I think that they use a lot of difficult terms, and that is where the misunderstanding come from.
-1	I feel like I handle health information pretty well.  As long as it is basic information anyway.  The minor things you have to fill out when you get to the doctor or that they explain to you during routine or semi-routine checkups I believe I fully understand.  When it gets to some of the more complicated explanations I need a little more guidance.  I don't always know exactly what they are talking about when they go in depth about things.
-1	I am educated and articulate, but I feel like dissemination of information is so provider-specific. For instance, I have a mild condition that was recently diagnosed, and what the doctor told me in terms of how common it is was not at all consistent with what his nurse told me, and what I had found anecdotally. So while I have the capacity to process quantitative information, sometimes it's more difficult when individual communication styles come into play.
-1	I feel fairly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand what I need to make appropriate health decisions,  Iâve utilized the Internet, my pharmacist and my nurse practitioner when needed.
-1	I feel that even though I am not a medical professional, I am able to ask questions until I feel confident that I understand the gist of the information about my medical needs and care. I do not always understand what is initially said to me or provided to me in writing but I feel confident that I am able to discuss with the medical provider the information until I understand it for the most part. I also have the ability to use an internet search engine to help me understand information as well.
1	I feel I am 100% confident in my health information and choices that I make.  I am in good health and hopefully I will remain that way for awhile.
-1	I feel like I am in a good position to do these things, but that is because I am somewhat intelligent. I feel like healthcare professionals are open to answering any questions that I may have and willing to do so in terms that I can understand. The only thing that I am not confident in is my ability to obtain all the information I need. Sometimes I am confused about where to go to obtain information.
-1	I think depending on the person explaining things, I can grasp the concept. And when I need more information I will ask for more.  I don't feel confident that I know the right questions to ask though.
1	I think I can understand health information well enough to make health decisions. I am familiar with making health decisions for myself and my kids.
1	I feel that I have full capacity to recieve and comprehend health information that is given to me. I am able to clarify information if needed and usually ask questions if something is confusing.
-1	Depending on which people I interact with I am mostly capable of doing this. There have been certain doctors and nurses I have run into that do not listen, do not believe what you say, and act like it is beneath therm to explain things to you that you do not understand
-1	I feel that I have a good capacity to obtain and understand such information, but the problem is often how insistent I feel that I need to be in order to get it. Another problem arises when there is more information needed to properly understand certain medical situations including specific policies and practices, but if one is not aware of the extent to which such information exists and therefore demands it and insists on thoroughly reading it, one is not offered it.
-1	I feel that I am confident in making health decisions. I know that I can always ask questions of those with a better understanding if something confuses me. If I don't understand something that they have said, I often look their answers up on line so that I can see it worded in normal language. 
1	I believe I could interpret just about any health information given to me on my own and take actions based on my understanding and comprehension. I think if I had trouble understanding any of it, I would be able to ask appropriate questions of a provider and get answers I could use to understand it better.
-1	In regards to all of the questions that I just answered, I feel that I completely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when I am presented with information and materials that explain health information and services in an accurate way and when I take the time necessary to read through the materials without being rushed.
-1	I can usually comprehend and understand most of what a doctor or nurse says. I try to have them repeat anything I don't understand. A few instances, I did not accept their evaluations or diagnoses.
1	I feel that I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have always had an interest in the medical field and worked in a hospital for a brief time about 30 years ago. I read a lot of online sources and follow news about medical issues and advances so I consider myself to be competent enough about most medical issues to get and deal with any relevant health information or services I might need to make the right health choices.
-1	I believe I have a very good grasp on obtaining and understanding medical materials regarding my own health, whether I need help with it sometimes or not. In addition to having people around who could help me, I feel rather comfortable asking my doctor for help and if I still need help, I'll either research online or ask others.
-1	I am as capable as anyone at understanding health information provided to me, but health is very specific and individual and I believe often that doctors speak in generalities because to do more would require more time than they have to offer or I want to pay for.  So some specifics, or details that would make my situation different from the norm, get lost unless I continue to have a problem that warrants further specific attention.
-1	I believe that I do have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I feel that in most situations the information is easy for me to understand. There have been times when I needed more clarity on forms and medical terms or diagnosis. The times when I needed clarity I usually turn to the internet first before I turn to a doctor or nurse to get the information I need to make it more understandable. Getting a hold of a doctor or nurse on the phone usually is a long process that I like to avoid. I like to get my information rapidly and not have to wait for a call back from a doctor or nurse. I think in my case it really helps that I took courses in college dealing with anatomy and physiology and disease. This makes it far easier for me to understand the information the doctor is telling me. I know in my own family there is often a lot of confusion over understanding health information. So I think it is a matter of having had exposure to certain terms and subjects in healthcare.  
1	I feel pretty confident in myself. I am pretty young for an adult still, but I believe I am pretty competent and confident enough to understand what needs to be done pertaining to my doctor and my health.
1	I have a science background, so the terminology is relatively easy for me to understand. In addition to communicating with health care professionals, I also do research on line with regard to my conditions.
-1	I often have to ask a few questions for clarification but generally understand everything ,my Dr. tells me. This includes written information and pamplets as well. I have also done online research regarding my lung disease to gain a better understanding overall. Generally my Dr. is very good about explaining things and answering questions I may have so I leave her office fully informed. If anything at times she is redundant and repetitive.
-1	I feel like I have good understanding of how to make an appropriate health decisions. I feel confident that I understand the basic process of obtaining the information I need to understand the health information and services.
1	I feel confident when I go into a doctors office that I will get as much clarity as is possible from a provider. My mother and sister are doctors and I am an occupational therapist, so I took several years of physiology, anatomy, neuro, etc.
-1	I think I can understand and process a lot of the information given to me by health professionals, but sometimes I need to get an extra opinion to maybe help explain it further to me. I also like to talk things out and I could have missed something so it's always good to have someone else look at the information and try to explain it to you.
-1	Health information can be very confusing. They do not always write the information so that an average person can understand it. Many times, I have to ask what the long medical terms mean, then I feel stupid. It can get scary, causing even more questions that are hard to understand. Having the internet so handy now does help with searching, but then you find other information that is really scary. 
-1	The processing and understanding are rarely an issue, it's really about getting the information I need to do these things that is the problem.  Usually when I go to the doctor I am a bit stressed so I forget to ask pertinent questions.  Then realize it after leaving.  When I get home I often try to call them but rarely get a response right away.  I most often times find what I need on the internet. Days later I will get a response from the doctors nurse.
1	I feel very capable regarding all health related information. I do have a degree in Nursing, so that gives me a great advantage. There are still things that I have questions on at times, or do not understand.
1	I feel like I can understand the services and basic health information without any issues. My reading comprehension has always been pretty high, so I've never needed any assistance. 
-1	I feel that I have a good grasp on the basics of how the human body works. As long as it pertains to one of the systems, IE respiratory, circulatory, it is fairly easy to understand. When the illness in question gets deeper than that, to the smaller functions of the body, is when it becomes difficult to understand.
-1	I sometimes feel I don't understand the terms and descriptions that the nurse/doctors are telling me.  A lot of times I get off the phone or get home and feel confused about the information I have been given.  I end up thinking of numerous additional questions I should have asked.
-1	"I am very bad at talking to my doctors because a I often don't want to ""make a fuss"" or I just assume that there isn't really anything they can do so I let it go. "
-1	I feel as thought sometimes I understand the information 100% and other times I feel completely lost. When I feel as thought I understand everything that the doctor and nurses are telling me, it's because I did my own research before I even stepped foot into the doctors office. When I'm told something I know nothing about, it's hard for me to understand completely because I know nothing about the medical field.
1	well I know abit about the terms and all that from biology and medical classes in school, so I know a bit about what they are talking about even if its in latin. figuring out all the insurance stuff is actually the biggest hassle i've had 
-1	I feel that I have a good capacity to understand health information and services with someone assisting me.  I think that it is always good to have someone look things over and help you through the way.  There is so much to consider and such complexity that I like guidance through someone who can help me clearly understand.  
1	I've worked in the medical field and have a child with medical disabilities.  So, I am fully capable of understanding medical terminology and know what questions to ask if and when I do not understand.  I also know what websites provide the best answers to questions I may have if and when a medical professional is not available for me to ask personally.  I am never afraid to ask a professional when needed.
-1	When I have an issue I always try to do a lot of research. When speaking with a doctor sometimes it is more complicated to understand. I sometimes feel a little insure when trying to be so accurate about the information everyone needs to help diagnose.
1	I feel VERY confident that i am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I am not yet of the age that any dementia has set in and I feel i have full mental capacity to obtain and process that information
-1	I think I'm a capable person when I go to the doctor.  When I have questions I follow up with whoever I can.
-1	I think if given access to adequate and accurate information and allowed sufficient time to proceed this information, I should be able to gain a greater understanding of my medical condition and to be able to make better health decisions. Also, the opportunity to have my questions answered in a nonjudgmental way is also necessary to achieve this goal.  
1	I feel completely capable of understanding basic health information, and I'm confident in my ability to make appropriate health decisions.  Health is my hobby.  I have spent countless hours reading information from a wide range of sources, from blogs to medical journals, to better understand my body and how it operates.  In terms of literature from medical professionals, I've never had a problem with it.
-1	Plenty and what i don't know i would ask the appropriate people to help me out with it. Doctor, nurse etc. I feel confident though that i could do it on my own as i already have access to my health information through my drs. portal.
-1	 While I have some familiarity with medical terms from working in a hospital while going to college that was many years ago. Some of the new diagnostic terms are new to me and I must have them explained by a health worker or doctor. In particular tests present a challenge when I try to interpret the results. If a battery of tests are given to me I need an explanation, not just of the normal parameters but, of how the results as a whole relate to my health. I have very little difficulty taking my meds as directed but sometimes, if I miss a dose or take too much, I must call my medical practitioner for assistance as to what to do next. 
-1	I feel like I am able to adequately obtain, process and understand basic health information.   Often I need to research these things but I am good at using things like the internet to research and filter the good information from the bad so even if I need to look at mutiple sources I am usually able to find a source that makes things easy to understand.
-1	I worked in a medical related field. Usually, i understand the terminology used by doctors or nurse. If i don't understand then i don't hesitate to ask them. Its my body i have to take care of it. If i still don't understand then i ask my closed friends or relatives. Most of them are in the medical field. For whatever reason i still need more explanation then i search on web and read about it, understand it and then make educated decison. Sometimes it does happend that i can't read doctors handwriting then i call their office and clarify it with their nursing staff, usually they are very helpful. 
-1	I feel as though the standard provisioning of materials is sufficient for me to understand what information is important and needs to be factored into any decision.
-1	Regarding all the questions I just answered, to what degree do you feel i have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions is basically enough understanding some situations can be harder to process
-1	I believe that I have enough knowledge to answer my basic health questions. If I go to the doctor and it is for something that could be serious or something that is complicated that I might have a hard time understanding, I usually take my mother with me because she is a retired nurse and she can help ask questions to the doctor that I might not think of or know to ask.
-1	Iâm not a doctor and Iâd never like to be, it scares me just thinking about it, but I like to investigate everything thatâs concerns my health like how my body works, how it reacts to certain medications, what I need to be healthy, so I pay attention to all and try to learn about it so I know how to make future decisions.
-1	I feel fairly capable of understanding basic health information. When that information goes beyond the basics it is a different story. Anything I am still confused about I will usually search for online.
-1	I know I have the ability to process and understand basic health information because I have a degree in Biology, so I've taken some classes that help with that. However, it's still hard to fully know what choice to make on some health decisions or what some things mean. I would say I have an above average ability but some people are significantly better at it.
1	I feel extremely confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information about my personal health, as well as services available to me. When I visit a doctor I make sure that all my questions are thoroughly answered and that I understand them before I leave. I also understand completely how to request visits for services, as well as fill out any information that may be needed. I also understand the importance of providing the most up to date and honest information in regards to my personal health, to the best of my knowledge, to my physician.
-1	Sometimes I feel the need to research information outside of what the nurse or doctor provides. They're not always thorough when they explain conditions or health concerns. They're especially vague about medications. I don't feel it is enough to just explain how and when to take medication. I should be thoroughly informed of possible side effects before it is prescribed. Once a medication is prescribed the doctor always seems reluctant to change the prescription regardless of the side effects. Many times I have to choose between continuing a medication that has terrible effects and is sometimes ineffective to treat a condition or discontinuing it altogether. When that happens the doctor thinks I am simply not following their recommendation when it is really due to bad side effects that I cannot live with. I am capable of understanding and following the doctor's instructions but sometimes they don't understand why I am unable to continue with their recommendations.
-1	Getting and understanding the information is the easy part. Having the money to pay for the services is the hard part. I usually understand what I'm being told without asking a lot of questions. That's just me though: way back in high school, my biology teacher asked me if I learned by osmosis because I did well in class but never asked questions.
1	I'm pretty insistent on getting questions answered. On the other hand, I have found doctors and nurses to be kind of vague sometimes and rushed. So on my end, I'm pretty confident in my ability to ask the right questions, but not always confident that I will get clear, decisive answers. 
-1	I am 41 years old, and also a parent to 2 children.  I have had to take myself and my children to the doctor many times, so I feel confident in understanding basic health information.  On top of that, I lost my mother to cancer, and have since had to accompany my father if necessary to some of his appointments.  My brother is a nurse, so sometimes I ask him for medical advice.  If I am not sure I ask our doctor to clarify anything I may not understand.
-1	I have been able to make good choices so far in life.  I expect that I will continue to make good choices.  If I doubt myself, that's typically when I ask for someone else's opinion.  If I do not understand something, I typically would call my doctor for advice, or use the internet to expand my knowledge on certain subjects.
-1	I feel I have a basic understanding to make positive decisions about my health.  I do however struggle with some of the insurance portions of health.  I also struggle with some of the terminology used in the medical industry.  I think overall I am average or slightly better at understanding health information.
-1	I feel that I have some capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. Some of the forms and material can be confusing, as well as some of the explanations by doctors or nurses, but I usually have them clarify it in simple terms that I can understand.
1	I am always the one in my family (even with my husband) who goes over the medical information about each family member. I was there every step of the way and made all the decisions when my husband was in and out of the hospital two years ago. I think I have a pretty good understanding of how the health information and services work and how to make the appropriate health decisions for me and my family.
1	I feel that I am highly capable of obtaining the help I need to make appropriate health decisions. When I pick physicians I look for ones that are personable and beyond willing to make me fell comfortable. All of my physicians go over and beyond to make sure I have anything I need and understand all medical information. I am also prone to research things that I am unfamiliar with via the internet. 
-1	It is very hard to obtain it all. With my condition I cannot remember a lot of things and cannot understand the terms that the doctor use. I get afraid to ask them for simple terms or written information so that I can go home and read lated
-1	I feel that I have the basic services needed to help me to understand health information that I may not necessarily understand on my own. Services in my hometown and well as my local hospital and pharmacy are always willing and available to ask for assistance when needed and are also friendly as to make asking for help as painless and easy as possible. 
-1	I feel like I have a good capacity to understand health information, since I am going into a health field. I sometimes find it difficult to tell doctors everything I planned to
-1	I feel like I am very well informed to be able to make my own decisions.  I may need my doctor to fill prescriptions but I am capable of doing my own research on my health.  I believe the best patient is a well informed patient.   While doctors might have the education, I know my body and how it reacts to medications.  I wish that Doctors listened to their patients more than just listening to what testing show them.  If doctors were taught listen to their patients I think they would have a better relationship with their patients. Those patients would also receive better care and would live a better and fuller life
-1	I believe that i am more than capable of obtaining and understanding information about conditions that i have had and basic information about medications that i need to take. I have in the past asked for additional information about prescriptions and uses and side effects of them at time
-1	i think every time when i visit doctors office i probably understand them about 50% or less, most of the time when i come back home i ask my wife to explain more in details or i start looking online for explanations 
1	Firstly, I am a retired registered nurse so should be able to effectively read and understand medical information.  But, as any patient, I sometime don't want to give all the necessary information to my provider (silly, I know), but it's human.  Sometimes also, because of my medical background, I don't ask questions I want to because I feel the provider thinks I should already know the answer.  I sometimes have to remind the providers that they can't assume I know something about my medical condition because I am a nurse.  There may be new information I don't know or I may have forgotten the information.
-1	I think I have basic understanding of my medical conditions but I wish I was more educated about how my body works, more importantly how and why my body has certain issues that negatively effect my life.  I often have to do my own internet research because medical professionals sugar coat things for me.
1	I feel like I have all the capacity needed to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have not found any situations through any of my medical needs (a couple of surgeries, procedures, and just normal every day needs) when I could not clearly understand the information given to me or get my questions answered. 
-1	I think that I need to learn more to understand clearly the medical terms and in that way to have a broader perspective of the diagnosis to evaluate each possibility and obtain more recommendation as far as my health is concerned.
1	I feel very capable of obtaining and understanding my health information. I know how to find services to use to make health decisions when necessary. If I need help understanding something I use resources provided to find out the meaning.
-1	At times I have a little bit of brain fog that keeps me from comprehending things immediately. Iâm not sure where this comes from. Usually, if I re-read things a number of times I will comprehend it. It helps if I read with a pencil so I can underline, or make notes. Most doctors visits go ok for me, but if I think it will be an important appointment I will take my wife with me to help me think and ask questions. If I donât bring my wife I often forget everything that was said in the appointment after about five minutes.
-1	Sometimes I struggle with diagnosis and medications given. Sometimes I feel like the medical decision is black and white no gray. They donât give you a chance to explain your side that already have their mind made up about you food intake and weight
1	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions to a great degree. On the rare occasion I don't understand something, even after asking for clarification, I reach out to my mother who is a registered nurse. 
1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have access to the information I need and can make informed decisions. Once in awhile I will have a hard time remembering some information I've been given or I'll forget to ask the doctor a question, but it's rare.
1	I feel that while I am not a health expert I do have the ability to listen to what the doctors say and I can understand what I am told so that I am able to understand what I am being told by them.
-1	"I am a relatively intelligent person so I'm confident in my ability to process information in general. The problem arises when medical terminology is used and not explained. This is particularly true of lab tests where I may be told ""X is high"", but not told why that is or what that means for my overall health. I have a chronic health condition that I had to read the medical literature on myself because doctors never explained things. "
1	I feel that I am fully capable of both understanding and knowing how and when to ask question so I do.  I work for a hospital so I am very familiar with a lot of the instructions.  I also always make sure I understand as I do not want to have to come back later.
-1	Yes, I understand the basic issues. I do know that I may not ask all the right questions. My wife does, though. I feel like I should just deal with things. I know that isn't the best way to handle health issues. But that is why my wife comes with me.
1	I am capable to understand basic health information.  I have to deal with it with my parents, with someone I took care of and a friend.  I can also find out information on the computer when needed for basic health information.  I also have a cousin and a friend who are nurses but I did work in the medical field for about a year.
-1	I have been going to the doctor for my health issues for a while now and I feel I have gotten pretty good at filling out all the proper paper work but I do notice sometimes if I don't right down questions too ask I will become overwhelmed and forget to ask those questions the problem that I find id a lot of doctors and nurses are in such a hurry they make you feel very rushed and it feels like they are not listening to you that is why I always bring someone with me to help me remember everything
1	I feel I have the (mental) capacity to obtain, process an understand medical information presented to me and I possess the ability to ask questions of medical personnel when needed.  Additionally, I have access to medical sources online and I have a niece who is local and is a certified nurse.
-1	i feel very confident in my ability to fill forms or read information about an illness, so this help me to make the appropiate decisions when are relate to my health
-1	I have an issue especially with most doctors hand writing. It's generally not legible. Secondly, medical staff are not always available to answer all the questions I may have. As such, I feel not very sufficiently equipped to understand basic health information.
-1	I feel that I am completely competent because I ask for insight regarding medical terminology that is confusing to me. I think it is important to ask the necessary questions with healthcare providers because they may feel that they are being understood. Thus, when I am in doubt I seek help from nurses, doctors, and pharmacists to provide me with information regarding any health concern. Additionally, my courses in speech and hearing and my medical terminology course have helped me to understand some basic health information. 
-1	I've never really had any confidence in dealing with this kind of stuff on my own. I've always been a rather sheltered and dependent person, so depending on the importance, I'd prefer it if someone were to go over it with me or walk me through it to minimize errors. I don't do anything like this that often either, so I'm sure if I had more practice, I'd be all right on my own.
-1	Iâm pretty confident of being able to do what was described above.  So far my medical issues have been minor and doctors have been able to explain the information to me.  If I ever need to deal for more complex information my father has had plenty of experience.  And I frequently look things up on the internet. 
-1	I feel like I have a decent understanding and comprehension of basic health information and services. I have gone to the doctor a handful of times as an adult on my own and thanks to a very helpful reception, I feel very capable of making choices and filling out health forms.
1	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. My education is in Biomedical Science and I have some insight.
-1	I have a great capacity to obtain basic health information. There are many different sources that I can use to get an opinion. I have a good capacity to process and understand basic health information and services, but it could be better. I could ask more questions to have a better understanding but I sometimes do not ask when I should. 
1	Prior to my cancer diagnosis in 2012, I had a 10 year work history in the emergency department of our local hospital.  Also, in my 20's I worked for 5 years in the same hospital this time as a nursing assistant in the pediatric ward.  I do believe I have a substantial understanding of most health issues, not counting my own.  I also raised 4 daughters alone and the youngest has a history of severe asthma, so hospitals, dr's and nurses are second nature to me.
-1	I think I have a sufficient capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. Sometimes I feel the need to look online, ask a family member or contact the doctor for further information. However, I am usually confident in making health decisions myself. 
1	I feel extremely confident of my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decision. I had been in situations where I was provided with information about some medical procedures and I was able to make the right decisions. The last situation I remember was my tuba ligation. I sat down with the doctor first then the nurse they give me all the information about the procedure and give me the chance to ask questions that they answered and no one helped me understand or make any decision concerning the procedure.
-1	I believe that I can understand most information that doctors tell me but sometimes i ask family members who work in health care so they can advise me. I also look up information online and then I make the decisions.
1	I feel very capable. My husband handles all the paperwork for my family, though. So I don't really have any recent intricate experience with that.
-1	I think I have those capacity at least the same level with average people.If there is something I really don't understand even if I ask to the doctor, nurse, or pharmacist, I can ask her/him to write down or spell out so I  check on the internet and will understand most of things and be able to make appropriate health decision.
-1	Yes, I do think I could understand basic health information and services to make good health decisions. I know at my age now, I would not have a problem at this time. When I advance a little more in years, I might need more help.
1	I feel I can handle basic health information between me and my caregiver or doctor.  What can be confusing is dealing with actual health insurance forms and questions.  Dealing with the health insurance companies can be a real pain sometimes as things are not always in clear cut, understandable terms.  Between me and my doctor, if I don't understand something, I always ask for clarifications.
-1	I think I can make appropriate decisions but I have lost faith in the health field as far as being understanding and taking the time to hear you and then fully explain diagnosis. I've had a specialist prescribe me medications with telling me the name of it and cut me off and walked out of the room when I had questions. I have to rely on the internet to get info I need
-1	I usually don't have issues getting advice or finding help when I need it. The problem lies within the words used. I have to ask a nurse or a doctor often to get clarification on things. I can some times call a hotline to ask but I prefer in person explanations.
1	I am disabled right now and have had health problems so I'm not working but I am a Registered Nurse.  The health care world has changed in the past 5 years so some of the questions have changed and it seems to be more difficult to get the time and answers needed from health care professionals. I usually have the knowledge to obtain, process and understand basic health information and usually am able to obtain services needed.
1	I feel I can communicate well with medical staff.  I Don't have problems reading or understanding things, an I make sure I ask questions about anything I don't understand.
-1	I feel like I DO have the capacity to get information between asking people and going on the Internet to start of the search for info
-1	I have the capacity to understand basic health information but because I have severe anxiety, sometimes I don't catch things the first time they are said or my thoughts are so jumbled I have a hard time asking questions I should ask. 
-1	I feel I have a great deal of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can read very well and I am very good at asking questions. Usually if I have any problems I can use the internet to help me if needed. 
-1	Even though I do not pretend to know everything about my health prognosis and course of action, every time I go to the doctor's office I make sure before leaving that I have a minimum understanding of my current overall status, the next course of action and desired results. 
-1	I am an intelligent person who unfortunately has had to deal with health issues, info and services for many years. This required me to become a very pro active patient. I keep abreast of everything to do with my health issues and am up to date on everything including medication and treatment options and services available to me.  And when I have a question or concern I consult with my physician or my husband who was in the health care field for 30 years.
1	I believe I have a strong capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and to make decision regarding my own health. I don't have too much trouble processing my health related information that I get from healthcare providers
-1	I understand somethings that are presented to me but my problem is when they use big words. It's hard to understand some big words in the context they have it in
-1	Sometimes I get confused by the jargon and procedures. But in general, I can go to doctors appointment by myself and be fine. I can communicate and get the help I need. And doctors are usually good about explaining the important facts. If there is medicine or procedure I'm not familiar with, even after asking about it, I'll look it up online when I get home. 
1	I think that i am quite capable in speaking with medical staff. I have to make decisons medically for an older relative and my sick children. I have a working knowledge of medicine and an interest. 
-1	I think I still have a good mind and can remember most things and I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something.
-1	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  However, my personality is such that I rarely speak up for myself and ask questions.  I have the capacity to understand.  However, I am unlikely to ask questions or seek assistance if I am unsure of something.
-1	I have no trouble understanding basic health information as it's given to me as long as its in layman terms.  My problem with comprehending health information is when they don't translate test results into basic english and leave it as medical jargon. Also, I find that a lot of the times when it comes to payment it seems like they intentionally leave is as hard to understand as possible, to get you to give up and comply. 
-1	When I go to the doctors or hospital, I feel there is a lot of red tape that we usually have to through with paperwork and our insurance information. Our health insurance cards sometimes are not updated in the system or our deductible is not what the card says. If you want to your chart or personal information, you always have ask like it is a big secret. We rely on the healthcare officials to assist us if we have questions.
1	I feel confident in my abilities to gather information regarding my health and ask appropriate questions of doctors if there are things I do not understand. 
-1	An average person does have difficulty filling out medical forms. I am only knowledgeable in this due to the fact that I have an associates degree in medical billing and coding. I often need to help patients fill out their forms on a regular basis. Some of the forms are very hard for a person to understand. I myself have not yet figured out why the forms can not be written in plain text that patients can easily understand. 
-1	Sometimes health questions and health forms are a little hard to understand. I feel as if i can fill out my own forms they are just sometimes hard to understand
1	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information. I make sure to ask questions if I don't know something and always hold my doctor accountable for the information they give me.
-1	I feel like I have a pretty good comprehension, and even if I don't know a term, I can read up and educate myself on a topic all on my own. I also feel that I do tell doctors my symptoms, but I tend to be pretty anxious, so I don't always ask all the questions that maybe I really should.
-1	I am fairly confident I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health info. Sometimes the info can be overwhelming and I may seek clarification or explanation from another source but after going over things a few times I am sure I can get the gist of it.
-1	I feel that I have the knowledge to understand about 75% of what is presented to me by doctors and nurses. They typically ask if I understand but to be honest typically when first presented with complex information it takes me a minute to process it.
-1	I have really bad anxiety, especially about my health. Unless my husband is in the room with me, or it's something routine like my psychiatrist appointments, I usually forget everything the doctor said right away. I'm always too scared to ask questions. 
1	I think I'm able to process medical info fairly easily. I've had a lot of hospitalizations in my lifetime and I studied bio and psych in college so I can capably read my own cbcs and most of my test results without needing much explanation. 
1	I have no problem understanding information that's been given or told to me when speaking with a doctor or pharmaceutical technician 
-1	I believe I have the capacity to understand and process health information. However, I am reluctant to ask questions of some doctors and will do my own research later instead.
1	I feel that I am quite able to understand, process or obtain what I need to make appropriate health decisions.  If I do not understand something or know what I need to do in situation I would ask the appropriate people or find the information needed.
-1	I feel pretty confident in my abilities to handle my care though some things are above my abilities to comprehend when it comes to medical care.
-1	I am certain I have a lot of the information. With the advent of the internet as a resource, I can always google for more information on specific terms. My main concern is what the doctor thinks and what, if anything I should be doing for preventative care. That's just as important as understanding the medicine I've been prescribed.
1	I think that I have a good awareness of my body, and how it usually functions.  Therefore I feel confident in my abilities to find out when something is off.  If they use medical language that I have not heard of, or is confusing to me, I have the cognitive capacity to ask for clarification.  I've never left an office visit feeling lost or confused due to medical jargon.
-1	I feel like I somewhat understand basic health information. It really helps when I ask questions and they answer it clearly. There have only been a few times when I truly did not get the help I needed.
-1	I do feel that I have the ability to make appropriate decisions. If something is confusing, I may search for more information on the internet or ask people for their opinions/experience. Sometimes I might not realize I have a question until I have left the Drs. office, and that is when I will look elsewhere. If I'm really not sure, I would call my Drs. office back. 
-1	I feel  i have adequate skills to read and obtain my health information. Sometimes though it is hard to get access to my doctors when I need them. 
-1	I feel that I am moderately capable of understanding medical things. I do not feel overly confident in my knowledge, but I have always had the ability to ask questions and get clarification if there is something that I am unsure of. I feel like doctors often use big words that are complicated to understand, when in fact it can be simplified in a way that can easily be understood. Often if I do not understand those big words, I will ask them to dumb it down for me. 
-1	Doctors are honestly so crabby so I rarely feel like I'm able to process what they're telling me fast enough to even formulate the questions I need to as. Given that, I rarely leave the doctor's office feeling like I understand my health information or what is being recommended for me. For example, I don't understand why I was instructed to get a thyroid test done so I never did it. I didn't understand if it was a light recommendation or if it was really necessary. And in terms of processing, I feel like they're always going too fast for me kind of like I said before. 
-1	I understand some of the medical jargon they spit at at me. I know my body and my medical needs. This makes it a bit easier to understand what i need.
1	I really feel that most people have to rely on the information that their doctors present to them.  That is something that can lead to unfortunate circumstances when you consider that doctors are humans and some humans tend to take advantage of others.  
-1	I think I have an adequate capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. When I dont understand something I utilize resources to help me.
1	I feel very competent in making decisions regarding my basic health services.  I have a chronic disease that requires constant utilization of health services.  I have gained a lot of experience in dealing with my insurance company and the health professionals that treat me.
-1	I often re-read the medical forms to be sure I am answering them to the best of my ability but I find myself holding back questions for doctors because I don't feel comfortable in my own abilities in sounding educated. I am in constant pain from fibromyalgia and have had difficulty in finding a doctor that won't just give me some pills for depression and send me on my way. 
1	I have the full degree and understanding to make health care decisions. I am fully understanding of my health care decisions. I have noone to help me overall and have no choice but to be fully understand my own healthcare choices.

-1	I feel that I am able to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to an average capacity. I don't necessarily know more about medical things than the average person, but I think that I have enough common sense and knowledgeable enough about other things that I can make informed and appropriate decisions regarding my health.
1	I feel that I have complete control over the health and Medical services I need. I have a primary doctor that I see several times a year and I am completely comfortable asking him any questions I may have concerning my medical condition.
-1	I think I have the the capacity to understand basic health information, but sometimes I don't think of the right questions to ask until I'm home and I realize I should have asked more questions while I was there.  Then it's too late and I search the web for information which is maybe not as good as getting information specific to my needs from my doctor.
1	I feel like I can adequately understand health information and necessary services. If I don't understand something I will ask questions.
1	I feel as though I very much have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I understand a lot about my medical conditions and can read and understand information very well. 
-1	I think that I am able answer any and all questions but I know I need assistance in understanding some things mostly because I don't know the technical terms but I know what is being spoken about in common English.
-1	I think i have somewhat of a decent grasp of what I need to do with the information I receive for the most part. However, there are times when I'm left puzzled by certain information and a doctor isn't always available to answer my questions.
-1	I feel capable of understanding information provided to me. Sometimes I don't feel comfortable asking questions depending on the doctor or provider. That makes me concerned about making a decision about my health. 
1	Extremely confident.  I have a basis in A&P/medical in high school/college so i understand most things.  If i don't, my doctor or nurse is always willing to further explain to me.
-1	I feel that I am very literate and have an easy time understanding things so long as they are explained in terms that I am familiar with. What I mean by that is if you use the word contusion I am less likely to understand than if you use the word bruise.
-1	My sister in law is a BSN, so obtaining information when needed is fairly simple. However, I don't really like to get information from her for reasons I need not go into here. I'm the type of person that if something doesn't make sense, I'll ask questions. If I'm unable to ask directly, I'll do some researching on it to see if I can figure it out and then if I'm still not sure I'd ask her.
1	I am a highly educated women who has a lot of knowledge when it comes to my health.  I know that if i dont ask questions that I will not learn everything that I need to know about my health and condition.
-1	I feel that I have the knowledge, vocabulary to understand basic health information. I might at times need some help with unfamiliar terms but basic stuff is not a problem.
-1	I feel I am capable of making correct decisions and understanding what is being told to me.  I also have no problems asking the doctor to elaborate or explain in simpler terms if I do have an issue. 
1	I feel confident in getting information on most things at my healthcare providers location and over the phone. The biggest complaint that I have is with billing. My bills are never up to date (on their end) and so I never know what is going on.
1	I have a pretty good capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information and services.  The challenge comes in when the doctors assume that all is understood and speak/move quickly.  Most of the time I am assertive enough to stop them and ask my questions, but at times I don't even think of the questions until I am out of the office or the doctor has already left the room.  Bedside manner isn't always top notch either. 
-1	If your goal is to get a degree without paying for it, itâs highly unlikely youâll be able to do that. However, online sources, schools without walls, and external degree programs are becoming increasingly common, and will only continue to increase in our digital world. Many colleges, even some of the best, offer online courses you can take for free, or, if you pay for them, you can get college credit for taking them. For instance, the University of Massachusetts (Amherst) has a University without Walls program that offers online courses and grants credit for experience. However, youâll need to pay for your credits. Even Harvard offers a number of free (non credential) and paid (credentialed) courses.
1	"I believe that I am 95% competent in regards to obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services when needed. I reside with a nurse so most questions I have can be filtered through her.  Anything she is unaware of she can research to gain a broader understanding of the information needed and I go from there. If there is anything that neither of us understand, then the problem is generally past the point of ""basic"" and a specialist needs to intervene.  The only time I ever had issues obtaining and processing information about my health and the services rendered was when I was in labor with my child. To be fair, I was a bit preoccupied with the pain to really understand what was going on around me at the time."
-1	I feel like I can understand the information given to my by healthcare professionals, however, I still find it nerve-wrecking to ask all the questions that I need.  Sometimes I feel like the physician is in a rush to get to the next patient and thus, I feel like I'm being a burden by asking too many questions.  The physician seems unwilling to truly find out the source of my issues.
-1	I feel somewhat confident i have the capacity to obtain,  process and understand basic information and services with regards to making appropriate health decisions due to the access of information provided by internet and other media outlet.
1	I feel I have a good understanding for the most part when it comes to health information and services. I try to ask questions although sometimes I am uncomfortable and do not ask my Dr. them. If I don't ask the Dr. I always go home and look up further information online. I always read the info that the pharmacist gives me and feel pretty competent. 
1	I think I have the knowledge and ability to understand health information and services. I have an education in public health, which gives me the background information I need to make informed choices. I'm also comfortable asking questions.
1	I personally feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand health language. Due to my background and education, I feel confident in my knowledge regarding health care, medications, disease and insurance. I understand basic but also moderately advanced health information and services, allowing me to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I feel like I have full capacity to grasp and obtain all of the needed information. I also have full ability to research on my own. The thing I struggle with sometimes is trying to absorb all of the information when the doctor is talking to me. If they rattle off a bunch of values from my bloodwork, for instance, sometimes I have trouble remembering what they said an hour later.
-1	I think that I am smart enough to grasp most concepts and information I to obtain in regards to me health.  More importantly though I know when to ask questions and seek information I do not know.  That means asking a nurse or a doctor, or seeking the information on-pine. I am not afraid to ask if I do not know.
-1	When im not sure about a medical term I go online and i get as much information as i can. Before i would go to a medical appointment without preparation . As soon as i was in front of my doctor i would forget everything. Now i take a notebook write down all the symptoms i have, in addition, i write down all the questions i have. Lastly, I believe my basic knowledge and what i can gather from online and what my doctor tells is what gives me the knowledge to make health decisions for myself.
1	Yes I do believe that I can handle any information that I am given by any medical professional or any professional at this point in my life. I am intelligent and can grasp the content of any discussion.
-1	I feel that most of the time i am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information by myself. But sometimes i need the help of a medical assistant to help me.
1	I have the full capacity to understand basic health information because I know how to read the information given to me and compute it as well as answer any health related questions that are needed of me. I also have the ability to ask questions if anything is unclear or confuses me 
-1	I am fairly efficient at getting the information I need from a combination of asking questions and looking things up on the internet.  I will check definitions of words and terms if I am having trouble.  I am comfortable with most language and when I have trouble I have a good friend who is consistently able to help me. 
-1	i have the basic knowledge and quite experience about all the stuff listed in the previous questions because i visit hospital ocassionaly and for checkups and treatments
1	I feel that I am completely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information.  I may forget to ask a question at the doctor's office but I'll do the research to figure out an answer.  I'll research online, ask a friend with a medical license or call my doctor's office.  
1	I am smart aware person. I don't have any mental issues that keep me from understanding instructions given to me from a doctor or nurse or any medical professional. I feel like a competent person who can handle anything.
-1	I have asthma and over the last 20 years I have learned to be an advocate. I read and learn and when I am with my doctor, I ask very concise and direct questions. I want to know about better medications and any side effects. 
-1	I feel I have the ability to obtain and understand basic health information and services needed so that I can make an appropriate decision regarding my health. I feel I have the knowledge to seek information from the right sources and the ability to ask questions I don't understand. 
-1	I feel that I absolutely have the capacity to obtain and understand health information.  My main issue is that I don't always ask clarifying questions because it takes me a while to process information.  
1	I believe that I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding information regarding my health. I have a hearing loss and occasional difficulty understanding professionals with strong accents, but will make sure I have a thorough understanding before leaving the appointment. The internet is also a valuable tool and I have reached out to professionals by phone as needed. 
-1	I would begin with educating nurses about using a universal precaution approach. Always use plain language when speaking with patients. Nurses should use plain, jargon-free words when discussing medical information. Individualizing the teaching by using words the patient is familiar with will enhance a patientâs understanding. All patients benefit from the use of plain language. Assess patient's understanding of the information provided.
-1	I often have troubles with the doctors information and procedure explanations. I understand about fifty percent of what they tell me. Often a nurse will help me understand. I also go on the internet for more information. 
-1	Since I come from an applied science background (engineering), I feel that I am pretty good at sorting through actual medical literature, research, etc. regarding conditions and their treatment. However, I'm much less confident dealing with the administrative side of medicine and health - finding the best providers, ensuring that all billing and payment go smoothly, etc.
-1	I have very little medical knowledge, but I am able to understand and process what a doctor or nurse tells me as long as they take their time and define medical terms.  When I know I have a procedure coming up, I take a notepad with me to the doctor's office so I can write down the process I need to follow - such as blood testing, pre-admission testing and so forth.
-1	I feel like I understand most of the information that I get from doctors and nurses but sometimes I don't know exactly what they're talking about so I have to ask extra questions or ask them to help me. 
1	Quite good. I'm quite interested in and pretty knowledgeable about science and health. Even if I'm not familiar with the specific topic, I can usually grasp new things quickly. The internet is a great resource, and I'll usually do a lot of research there. I'll ask the doctor questions when needed as well, but I've learned that doctors are not as well-versed in all aspects of health as some people may assume, and I always look beyond the doctor's opinion into scientific research and other resources.
1	I believe that I possesses an adequate ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I don't recall ever needing help understanding this information as an adult. 
-1	Overall I would say that my capacity for understanding and processing basic health information is very good.  I find the reading material easy to understand, if I have questions I can usually ask the nurse or doctor at the time of my appointment.  I also can look online for questions regarding my condition.
-1	I think have the ability to access the information I need to make good decision about my health and the health of my family.
-1	I believe that I have a high capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions, especially when my daughter is with me to help me fill out certain forms and explain certain things to me. I have needed her help many times, especially with documents with small print.
1	I feel like I am capable of understanding and communicating with health professionals about my healthcare.  I also feel confident about making appropriate health decisions for myself.
-1	I can understand different health conditions by reading about causes, symptoms, and different treatments online.  If the doctor told me something about a condition I had I would do my own research on my time.  I understand the risks when taking prescription medication.  I have also filled out forms applying for health insurance and have filled out other official forms online.
-1	I feel that I am very well equipped to handle these basic health information and  services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I always take my time reading the information presented for me and ask the right questions. 
1	I completely understand what my medical professionals says to me because I am always asking questions throughout the whole process so I clearly understand what is been said and I generally go over the main points with the professionals at the end of the conversation so we are all on the same page when I  leave and if something is still not clear  when I get home I call and get it clarified
-1	I have the capacity to get information but I don't necessarily know how to interpret it. I also don't know some medical terms.
-1	Most of the information that I receive from my doctor is directly explained to me without any problems. My doctor is very understanding that I may not understand MD's talk so she explains it to me more easier. I feel there isn't a problem and that I get all the information I need.
1	I have trouble understanding technical jargon that some health professionals speak. When I do not understand I have the abilities to ask questions that result in the health professionals explaining these issues so I can understand. 
-1	I feel that if I am presented with a medical situation that I do not understand by myself that I know where to go for help.  A family member, have the question ready for a nurse, the internet or my insurance call center help line.
1	I feel pretty competent in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	The degree I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information is extremely well. Iâm a 2nd year medical student and have grown in knowledge as an upcoming physician. Of course I donât know everything, but when I myself need to go to the doctor Iâm not afraid to obtain information, understand it, and Iâm confused or have questions, my doctor is very well in explaining it. I sometimes consult with my family in important decisions, but other than that Iâm very good in making appropriate decisions when it comes to my health, and what is between me and my physician. 
1	"Although I've made a few trips to the doctor, and my children were delivered in a hospital, I primarily manage my own health. After dealing with chronic, and ultimately fatal, illness in both my parents, I was motivated to educate myself on proactive means to maintain my health so I don't need to see health care professionals. This has worked very well for me for 30 years, and I hope it continues to do so. But yes, I have a lot of knowledge about the current western medicine, to the point I had one of my mother's doctors ask if I was a medical professional. I said , ""No, but I guess you could say I am a 'lay' professional. :-)"""
-1	I don't feel as if I have the capacity to obtain and understand basic health information greatly. I constantly need help in understanding basic health information. 
-1	The problem is with the fact that the basic health information itself that is so dumbed-down it gets in the way of making appropriate decisions.  Health services are then rendered based off of the inadequate information.   There's never any mainstream knowledge given to the public to help them understand how to implement knowledge to help themselves from the ground up; a perfect example of this is with nascent iodine, which helps the thyroid which is the master gland of the body responsible for balancing all other organs.   Without nascent iodine, fluoride, intentionally put in drinking water overwhelms EVERYONE'S thyroid.  But from an allopathic perspective, 'if ain't broke and the test doesn't say so, don't fix it'.  The Rockefellers taking over medicine in the 1940's and helping create the modern version of allopathic medicine is disgusting!
-1	I have zero difficulty understanding, processing, and obtaining appropriate health information that concerns myself. I have confidence in myself to figure out what I need to look up and how to go about obtaining the information or services .
-1	When it comes to processing and understanding all the health information that pertains to my own well-being, I believe I am confident in my ability to understand most of the jargon. However, since I'm no expert, there is some material which I will not always fully understand, and I am usually confident enough to ask doctors/nurses to give me some guidance.
-1	I think I am average when it comes to this kind of stuff. But there is some things that I just do not understand. So I ask for help when needed, even if that is often.
-1	I feel that I think I know what i am doing, but it is hard to be sure that what I think I know, is actually correct. I think this is done on purpose.  I think the forms should be written in a way a high school graduate could understand. Alot of the material on these forms are overly complex and does not make sense.  Help is hard to find . 
1	Yes. I am confident in my ability to understand the information provided to me and then using that information in order to make healthy and well educated decisions. I also do follow up research myself, to verify any information given to me.
-1	I think I feel more comfortable if I have help from someone else when going over these things regarding the process of obtaining and carrying out various things concerning health care. I understand the basics and how they relate to me personally, but anything beyond that I usually ask my mother since she has dealt with these types of things for her entire life and she is very knowledgeable about them.
-1	I think I have the ability to process and understand basic health information given my background in chemistry and biology. For terms/concepts I don't understand, I tend to Google the information to learn about it. 
-1	I think that I would be able to retain as much information initially. If there was anything that seemed confusing I would then write it down for later so that I could research it myself to the best of my ability. However, before it would get to that point I would ask as many questions as I could.
-1	I believe that I am capable, perhaps not highly, to understand basic health information and to what degree I may not be I use the internet to seek further information and guidance. This has helped me greatly improve my knowledge of various health issue
1	I feel like I am pretty good at obtaining and understanding health information. I have an English degree and teach high school reading, so I am more proficient at the English language than most people. When I do not understand something, I generally Google it to find the answer. I often know exactly what the doctor and/or nurses will tell me before I even go in because of my own research.
1	I think I am very capable in this area.  I am not by any means a professional, but I do read a lot, and have seen many documentarys and educational materials about health related issues that I am quite comfortable with my ability to read and understand as much as I need to.
-1	i'm not senile. i just turned 56. now i know how old people feel. i think i'm able to get and understand health info as well as anyone 
1	I always make sure I read any document medical or otherwise that requires my signature completely thoroughly. I read quite a bit in general, and do so at a practiced leisurely pace to ensure I process what I am reading. Medical information especially is extremely important to understand everything pertaining to what you're getting involved in the moment you step into a doctors office or hospital. Health decisions are some of the most important decisions we make in our lives, considering these decisions literally do directly effect our life and livelihood. I know there are a lot of people who don't tell their doctors enough information, and don't read enough into the pros and cons of medical decisions for many reasons, but I know that I'm not one of those people. I am still young and health is important at every age.
-1	I feel like I have a general knowledge of how to take care of myself, but I find doctor's visits awkward and tend to feel rushed and without time to ask questions or get explanations for what the doctor is doing.
-1	I feel that I am very capable of processing the information and making informed decisions.  However, I find that I often forget to ask pertinent questions that I later think of at home.  I may also do some more research at home and find that I have more questions.  There have also been times where my doctor was unable to provide me with a satisfactory answer to my questions.
-1	I believe I have a good capacity to obtain all of the information/services I need to make health decisions, because I constantly ask questions when something is unclear, or do my own research later (online or second opinion, etc.), and I have a fairly good ability to process this information as well. I have good listening and reading skills, and a passing knowledge of basic health information myself.
1	I have no problem understanding my condition when I talk to my doctors or nurses. If they use a term I am not familiar with I would ask them to explain it to me in a way so that I could understand. When I am confused or unsure I always ask questions until I get a clear picture. I don't mess around when it comes to my health since it's one of the most important things I value.
1	I feel very confident in my ability to communicate my symptoms and concerns to the doctor and then ask questions to clarify my understanding when they give a diagnosis.  I ask a LOT of questions and then I go home and do a little more research online.
1	I feel very confident in my ability to understand basic health information, and to obtain services if I do need help understanding what information is given to me.
-1	 I do not feel like I am adequately prepared to deal with a health issue. The facilities near me are very bad and most people I know refuse to go to them in anything short of an emergency. The one time I went they told me to drink some tea and use Nyquil. They charged me $350 for that information. I asked numerous questions and the doctor just didn't them and seemed more interested in getting me out of there. From that experience I took it upon myself to start researching  and learning what questions to ask and where to go that would provide adequate healthcare. The internet is great source of information and I feel I have benefited greatly from using it for answering some minor medical questions. 
1	I believe I am pretty competent and intelligent and would be able to understand any basic health information I am given and any services I would need to have in the future.
1	I feel that I am fully capable of making the appropriate health decisions. I make sure to ask the doctor any questions I have by making a list beforehand. If the doctor gives me information that I do not understand, I always have the doctor explain it to me. If there is a question with medication I do not hesitate to speak with the pharmacist. I will generally read a lot about anything that I have been diagnosed with as well. 
1	i work in healthcare so i understand lots of medical terms and procedures and what i do not know or understand i simply ask for clarification on. when it comes to my health i always make sure i am 100% sure of all the information needed to avoid any situations.
-1	I feel like I have a basic understanding of most medical terms, but some of the jargon remains opaque to me.
1	I feel confident, but most likely because I haven't had to deal with any major health issues yet. I find that the internet is a very vast source of information, that can supplement a medical professional's advice in terms of what to do regarding treatment or diagnosis. I feel as though I have ample access, as well as everybody else living in the modern era, to access vast wells of knowledge whether it be via the internet, through word of mouth, or through the expansive network of medical institutions which seem to be always open. Even if you can't get an appointment right away, there seems to always be alternate options.
1	I can read well, i can see well, i have enough intelligence and experience to know who to call for help and information if i need it. i have 100 degree confidence in my ability to call whoever needs to be called or asked a question if i need it.
-1	I feel that I am well informed about medical situations that I am in or my children are in. Often I will research information before going to the doctor so that I have an idea about what we will be discussing. Usually, if I am struggling to wrap my mind around what is going on I will ask questions until i fully understand so that I can care for myself or for my child in the best possible way.
-1	I feel I'm very capable of understanding documents in general because I read them frequently for work. Reading health documents is a little more complex but the basic idea is still the same. I can easily search online for credible information and get a variety of views on what is best for me.
-1	I obtain information most of the time, although I may have to study and ask questions to completely understand what I read or hear.  I usually need the doctor to take the time to explain everything and to take the time to answer my questions.
1	I feel I have a full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information as I often do read all of my material from my provider. I also will ask questions if I am unsure of how to complete any forms. I also make sure to answer a health questions so that I have a better understanding with my health care provider. 
1	I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Although I am not a medical professional, I am intelligent and educated. I'm pretty good at navigating difficult situations like the health area, even though I don't have an insider perspective.
-1	When I am meeting a doctor or health professional face-to-face, I feel fairly comfortable with obtaining and understanding health information as it applies to me.  This normally involves me asking several questions and occasionally asking for clarification.  There are also times when my doctor (who I've established a relationship with) will give me examples and scenarios as that is more in-tune with my learning style. When I am reading health information on my own, I often find the information overwhelming and hard to process as I can interpret the details in many different ways - or might find the text to be vague and hard to understand in general.
-1	I think that at least half of the time I can obtain all of the information I need to made appropriate health care decisions.
1	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed. I am very adamant about understanding before I leave and if for some reason I don't or forget a question I meant to ask, I will call to ask it.
1	In general I feel that I can understand everything the doctors tells me about my health. At times when it comes to my husband's health conditions it is more complicated so I do ask my son to accompany us to the doctor to make sure that I do not miss anything that I need to know. I think as I get older sometimes doctors treat us differently like they do not have faith in us understanding them and that gives me doubt at times even though I do everything I need to do in my life without any problems. But as far as basic health instructions and decisions I feel very confident at this point with regards to my health. My husband on the other hand hates going to the doctor and turns his doctor off without listening to anything he says because he does not want to hear and doesn't believe most of it. 
-1	I feel like I've got a good degree of understanding but medical literature can be confusing and a lot of times I forget what I want to ask the doctor or I feel too nervous to ask him
1	I think I have a high degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I usually write down questions I may have and the answers I'm given to make sure I have all the information I need.
-1	I feel like I am decently well-informed at the basic level about health information and services and I do feel reasonably confident in my ability ask my PCP or other doctors I've seen to clarify instructions for my care. I'm also somewhat of an outlier in that I have several medical professionals in my family (physicians assistants, registered dietitians) so they are always available to help me understand anything my doctor may miss.
-1	I feel I need to ask most of the time about a small part of the forms when filling them out but most seems fairly easy. If I have questions they are always helpful in answering but I do feel at time I need to ask. I also have others I can ask and do research for myself. 
-1	I am generally able to understand information that is given to me, but sometimes there is a lot of information given all at once, and verbally, and it is hard to process it all at the time, particularly under the stress of being ill, so questions may not occur to me until later, or I might forget some of the details when there is a lot of information given at once.
1	I feel like I can read and understand basic medical information.  I feel that I can do this on my own, without any assistance.  And, I believe that I understand what is told to me or give to me to read well enough to make my own medical decisions.
1	I have some experience in a health-related career. I feel fairly well-equipped to understand common terminology, as well as some of the more common services that a provider would recommend.
1	I am quite capable to ask all of the needed questions regarding my condition while providing my doctor and nurse with the details necessary. So far , in my life, i have not had any incidents of not understanding something.
1	I'm young enough, reasonably smart, and have an internet connection so, yes, I certainly have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.
1	Because of my own ability to research and my ability to tap the wisdom of others in my personal life, I feel confident about my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. 
1	I feel I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services.  When things get beyond basic and into more complicated subjects, I may need a medical professional to help simplify things for me.  If I read things enough times, I generally catch on to things.
-1	I feel that I am completely able to read and understand basic, moderate, and even challenging health information. I can say that I am not good at asking questions or probing further for fear of wasting time. But, I have never had an issue with the explanations or information given me. I also have no problem understanding or filling out medical forms. I have the awareness and knowledge to make health decisions regarding myself that I understand and am comfortable with. In fact, I don't find most health forms, diagnosises, or health information that complex actually. So, to answer the question I am completely comfortable in this regard. 
1	My mind is sound and I have a B.A. degree in English (literature), so I can easily read and understand medical instructions and information about health services. If I need to know more about a health condition, I ask my doctor or nurse, and research the topic online.
1	I consider myself to be intelligent, inquisitive and self-aware.  I always did well in science and was in advanced placement classes in biology in high school.  I research any and all health conditions that I've had, as well as those health issues my family and friends have experienced. Once, a medical professional commented to me that he thought I worked in the health field.
-1	Most of the time I get enough information to make informed decisions regarding mine or my loved ones care. I feel that I'm at a good level of understanding. 
1	I am quite confident that I have the ability to understand medical information provided to me. I am able to easily process and understand basic health services without any issues. 
-1	I think I understand everything doctors or nurses tell me about my health. If I don't I usually ask lots of questions until I understand. Understanding the information about my (or my son's and husband's) health is very important to me
-1	I think that for the most part, I can get the information process it pretty well. If I do not understand something though, I always ask questions, either to the doctor or the nursing staff because that is why they are. They are there to answer things that you may not be completely sure of. When they start using the medical names for conditions or treatments, I start to be lost, until they break it down for me to understand.
1	I am confident that I have the capacity to understand health information that is shared with me, and the ability to make appropriate decisions based on that information.
1	I feel like I never have any issues when I am given instructions or information from my doctor. I would say that the only issue that would keep me from telling all of the information behind something that is bothering me is having a lack of comfort with the specific doctor or nurse I see that day. This usually only happens during urgent care visits. I always ask questions even if the doctor does not seem interested because, as the patient, I deserve to know exactly what could happen to me. Health is something that people should have a blasÃ© attitude towards.
-1	I believe i have 100% capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information because i have a voice and during my appointment with my doctor i can ask the questions that concern me the most. There's always someone,either family or hospital staff who could help me make the most appropriate health decision.
-1	I feel that for the most part I feel that I have the capacity to do all these things. If I have any questions, I can call my doctor's office and speak to a nurse to explain things. I could google any questions I had (regarding things like filling out forms). I could also ask my parents, who have much more experience as far as health services go.
1	I am educated enough to understand written material as long as it is not too technical or in this case not too burdened with medical terms.
-1	Yes, If I don't understand I ask as many questions as needed till I do understand. I am very concerned about my health.
1	I feel i understand things completely but doctors dont listen and just recommend things based on the massive consumption of what they see and i am a number that is not listened to. Although good intentioned doctors are overwhelmed with inputting info so as to not get sued. This is a shame because all that school and minimal output from fear and bad information.
1	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand the information I need to make health decisions. English is my native language. It is easy for me to read and understand information.
-1	I think I often don't even know the questions I need to ask and so that is why I feel like I miss out on knowing everything.
-1	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain and understand and process most basic heath and serviced in order to make decisions. I do have a background helping out in a doctors office for a very short time so this probably does help my understanding a good bit. I usually have doctors that inform me very well and explain stuff even when I do not need it explained. 
-1	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make decisions. I also know that it's not always easy or something you can accomplish in a timely manner. Health centers and hospitals differ, as do health professionals. I have a primary care doctor who is unfortunately overworked and somewhat difficult to speak with to the extent that I need to. On the other hand, when I had a fracture almost two years ago, all the specialists I saw after I left the hospital were very forthcoming with help and information, and they listened well. Their assistants were superb. However, my experience in the ER was terrible. Really terrible, especially while being in the midst of trauma. So I feel that my capacity to obtain what I need has been very uneven.
-1	I pretty much am able to obtain, process and understand basic health info and services to make health decisions.  Since I'm not in the medical field sometimes it hard to follow what the doctors are saying, especially if English is not their first language.
-1	While I am mostly able to understand the information given to me, I often hesitate to ask for clarification or to bring up questions that I wish to ask but that don't seem immediately relevant. I have some trouble filling out forms. I think my capacity to understand basic health information is good, but it could be better. 
-1	I feel like I can get the info from the Doctor. If I have any further questions, I'll ask health professionals I know, call my Dr. back,  and/or do additional research online. 
1	I can see and read perfectly fine. I don't like it when the Dr. doesn't give you time to respond to any concern that have arisen while he is talking to you. I almost always feel rushed. And uncertain what was even said. I have had so many come in and start going on about what needs to happen or what is going on right away. They don't give you time to process anything. You might have a question early on and the not hear anything said after that. Or else completely forget the question you had trying to comprehend what is being said. 
1	I am able to understand the majority of medical information and to get help if I should need it. I always know what services are available to me.
1	I have worked in the healthcare field in the past as an Ultrasound technician,  and therefore feel I have a basic understanding of healthcare in general.  Being able to understand a lot of the terms and being able to communicate with doctors is a big help for me.
-1	I feel fairly confident in my understanding of basic health information. At times certain health lingo may need to be put into layman's terms by the doctor or nurse when asked but most of the time I understand what I am told or reading. 
1	 I feel that I am quite capable of obtaining,processing, and understanding basic health information and services needed to help me make the appropriate health decisions for the following reasons: I am well educated ,have good communication skills and have a good head on my shoulders when it comes to making decisions.I also have some medical knowledge,having been raised by a mother who was a registered nurse.
-1	I have never really had a problem reading any material or filling out any forms.  Sometimes there is some medical jargon that I need to ask questions about though.
-1	I feel that I have the basic capabilities to read and understand what is being written regarding my health. If I am unsure about something then I ask the person that gave me the form to explain what is written. 
-1	I think I am very capable of understanding basic health information when needed. In addition to seeking information from health professionals, I may also initiate my own research they may potentially be further enlightening on a particular topic.
-1	I feel I can effectively obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for myself.
1	I feel I am able to make appropriate health decisions - I ask a lot of questions and if unsure I will look it up online to make an intelligent decision
1	I believe I am able to understand the basic information to make the right health choices. I am also very confident in asking for help to understand and make my own decisions.
-1	If I dont understand what a doctor is saying I can research on the internet. Services are dependent on my finances, so if I have the money I have the services. The bedside manner of a doctor matters too because if I feel like their agitated then I wont want to ask questions or share health information.
1	I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision to a high degree. The few times that I do not completely understand any medical information I am comfortable and confident in asking questions so that I can obtain a better understanding.
-1	I feel like I can understand some health information, but a lot of it is confusing because of all of the medical terms and the way medical professionals talk.
1	I feel like I have a high degree of confidence that I have the mental and physical capability to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make health decision based on my needs. I am able to ask questions and have the medical personnel explain in more detail if I don't understand fully.
-1	I feel that I can get the information I need, but not form doctors or nurses.I can all the information I need from the internet. I trust it more than some doctor who may no keep up to date to what is happening in the medical world
1	I feel like I understand basic health information very well. It is when the big fancy words come in where I need a little understanding.
-1	I feel that I can obtain information that I need about the process. I think when it involves a specialist for a specific issue, rather than a primary physician, information gets a little harder to obtain.
1	Based on some poor health care experiences in my teens and twenties, I rarely use doctors except for acute situations (i.e., where I need a prescription for antibiotics). When I think I need a doctor, I collect the symptoms, figure out my best guess for what's wrong with me, then go to the doctor with a careful explanation of what's wrong and what I likely need. Doing my own diagnosis to then get it confirmed by a doctor is a pain, but it has resulted in a lot better health care for me. I believe I can competently obtain and understand health information. I have also been successful in obtaining the few services I need. I make a point of trying to manage chronic conditions (such as obesity and obesity-related issues) without pharmaceuticals. Drugs, in my experience, are best used for acute problems. Change in behaviors, such as eating, are usually necessarily for chronic problems.
-1	I feel to a high degree that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Usually, I will ask pertinent questions and try to find out as much info as possible to make educated decisions about my health care. Moreover, I do online searches to understand as much as i can about the health issue. 
1	I do try to keep abreast of medical information, and am in the habit of asking my doctor questions. I feel that although he is the professional, it is my life and he works for me.
-1	I believe that I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information in most situations. Most of the time if you don't get lost in random jargon the point is clear. From time to time doctors and nurses say stuff that makes sense to them but doesn't to a normal individual that doesn't work in the medical field. 
-1	I feel at times I have little problem filling out, and understanding material but, at other times I feel I have difficulty understanding and comoleting certain forms or material. I also feel I am usually required to complete documents at invonveniant times.
-1	i don't really know that much about health-related things. my wife and kids usually help me out. i really don't like talking about my health, although i'll go to the doctor if it's something serious.
1	I'm pretty confident in answering and understanding health related questions because most of the time, I'm able to diagnose and help myself. Everytime I visit a doctor, I'm able to understand what he is trying to say, and I make sure that everything is clear if I don't understand anything.
1	Most times when I am given medical information related to my conditions or the prescriptions that I may have to take I usually have a good understanding of what I am told. However, when I do have questions I still like to ask general questions in case there was something that was omitted or missed accidentally. Usually when I have an ER visit I definitely ask questions because it seems as if the doctors only care about getting you out as fast possible unless your in need of life support.
1	I'm pretty good at understanding health stuff. I understand vaccines are important, second opinions are important for any major health issues/procedures, and I have a firm grasp on information. For example, I have a fibroadenoma, and I understand that it's a non-cancerous tumor that is actually very common, and I understand the ultrasound, sample-taking, and other information that led doctors to conclude that there is a 9999/10000 chance that there's nothing bad going on.
-1	I think I have a good capability to engage in the health care process. I have no problems understanding information that medical professionals convey to me. I understand what they are looking for when they ask me questions and I'm able to be a good patient as far as my volunteering information. There is some stuff that I hold back, especially if I'm embarrassed about it. I don't tend to ask questions at the end of the encounter, but I am able to look up information online and understand it well.
1	Having gone to 90% of the Doctor/dentist visits by myself I have learned to fill out all the info and ask all the questions I need to. The only time I have needed help was when I was coming out of surgery and had to have my mom sign paper work.
1	I got no issues with asking questions or getting info. I have a really good memory and that helps with remembering all that is said during medical checkups.
-1	I feel that I have the capacity to understand, obtain and process my health information because I pay attention to what is being told to me, and I personally care about what may be happening to me and want to fix it as best as my doctor and I can. I feel that I try to be as open about what is going on and ask questions that I worry about or information I do not understand. 
1	I think that I always feel the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions
-1	I would imagine that I would grasp and understand most of the basic information. Some topics might include information that goes over my head. I might need further explanation on some issues. 
1	I think that I am very competent to process and understand basic health information. I feel I can understand enough to make appropriate decisions regarding my health.
1	I believe that I am pretty good at understanding health information, and when I don't understand, I ask more questions or come home and do more research about the issue.
-1	I feel basic medical information is easy to process, unless it is something that you are not aware of. Say for instance your blood pressure is up, you ask why and the answer is.. could be a number of things.. and that's it. I understand it is general, but sometimes the answers do not help at all.
1	I'm already a nurse practicer and usually, I don't need the help of anyone to understand basic health information and services
-1	Even if i do not know the content or context of the health forms i can generally use context clues to understand the forms and make myself as caught up or as informed as possible with all decisions.
1	Yes, I feel as though I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health info. I can make appropriate decisions regarding healthcare independently and do have a source of help should I have a question.
1	I have had issues with my health specifically migraine headaches since I was twelve years old.  I feel I have learned to get the information I need to make appropriate health decisions.  I think that when I don't understand health information I seek counsel from someone I trust.  
1	I feel like I am generally capable of understanding medical and health information. The only areas I feel like I need help with are insurance-type information, as I have trouble understanding it. As far as things directly related to my medication and health conditions, I feel pretty confident. My parents are both nurses and so I am familiar with the medical world.
1	"I've worked in health care, and know the kinds of things that make a difference when doctors and others are making decisions.  I do some online research before I go to appointments, and usually have questions I'd like answered.  I also have been volunteering as a ""practice patient"" for medical students, which gives me a sense of how good doctors go about doing their work."
1	When given information I attempt to understand it the best I can. If I'm unable to understand something, a healthcare professional is always there to help me. Any time I ask for explanations help is given to me.
-1	It's kind of difficult to answer.  I have many conditions that are still unknown, so i cannot get actual answers very often, not to the fault of doctors or nurses most of the time.
1	I feel quite confident in my ability to understand, obtain and process any health information provided to me in order to make the best decisions regarding my health.  I am knowledgable in many areas of health, and research information prior to seeing a physician or nurse.
1	I have a background in emergency medicine. I have spoken with lay people as well as medical professionals in regards to many different medical conditions. Having some knowledge of peoples issues and medical terminology helps me to understand what I am being told about my own issues.
1	Assuming that a doctor or other provider is not withholding information, I believe I have the full ability to understand and process information related to my health.  I believe I have an adequate understanding of medical terminology to comprehend what a doctor is telling me and make an appropriate decision.
1	I feel that I have total capacity to understand basic health information between asking my provider, a family member, or google.
-1	I think for the most part I am able to understand most of the stuff that is told to me and if there is something I am not sure about I usually ask or I look it up on the internet.
-1	In general, I feel I have the capacity to understand and obtain medical information pertaining to me.  However, I always feel rushed and thereâs always the concern that additional appointments will be needed.  The cost is unreasonable and the time involved in making and going to an appointment is sometimes overwhelming.
-1	I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. However, because I have a slight visual impairment, I sometimes need assistance when filling out medical forms. That is the only issue I have currently in regards to situations like this.
1	I am confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions for my family and I. I have spent 10 years working in the medical field so I likely have an advantage, but I have never really struggled with any of this to begin with. I am very particular about my health care providers and will not stick with any doctor that does not explain things well or make information I need readily available and accessible to me.
1	I believe I am self-sufficient when it comes to this regard. I do not depend on anyone but  myself to get the information I need.
-1	I feel that overall I am able to process the information I get from my doctor or nurse.  I do need to sometimes look up things and get some ideas of questions to ask when I am not sure what the information means exactly for me.  As for my basic health I have a good understanding of what I am told. 
-1	I feel i am 100% capable to understand the processes of basic health and the services needed to help me make the right medical decisions. I went to nursing school so i understand medical terminology plus i tend to ask questions when i dont understand something. It is very helpful to do research at times to better understand. 
-1	I feel like I'm capable of managing my health and understanding basic information. I do feel like I don't ask all the questions I need to to truly understand because I feel like I'm a bother to doctors and nurses.
-1	 I withhold information that I believe will be used against me or give the doctor the idea to refer me to other doctors because that is a slippery slope.  Medical staff do not have time to answer your questions.  They go by textbook and give answers without having examined you or checked your history.  I don't trust medical staff.
1	I feel that I have a high capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I also believe that if I am given health information from a doctor that I can assess the situation and make an informed decision from there regarding what is appropriate for my continued health. 
1	I have the ability to understand basic health information because I understand how my body works and I understand the language they use.  I understand even better when I am given reading material.
1	I have a lot capacity to obtain,process, and understand health information given to me. If I have questions, I always ask until I do have a great understanding of what was told to me.
1	I am constantly reading about health and wellness to keep myself healthy. I do have regularly scheduled tests to monitor my health. I also ask my doctors questions to help me maintain optimal health as I age.
-1	I feel like I understand the doctorâs and nurseâs explanations sometimes. The only hardship that I have when they use medical terminologies or expressions that I am not familiar with. Anytime when this happens I can just ask them for further explanation and they help me understand the situation better most of the time. The only thing that I really do not like is that I feel that the doctors are always in a rush and by the time you have a question they have already left. This is not personal it is because of the healthcare system is about the money as well.
-1	I would say my capacity would be in the middle, a lot of what is said is foreign, but If someone is willing to take the time to thoroughly explain everything it would be alot easier to understand and be capable without anyone else's help. But in my experience most people don't want to put the time into explaining as that takes time. 
-1	I'm a college educated middle-aged man.  I do not have a background in the sciences other than basic classes.  I feel that I can understand consumer level medical information.  But when I hear lipid counts, or other medical tests/jargon, I start to glaze over, honestly. 
1	I feel that I have everything I need to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. I sometimes have an issue understanding exactly what the doctor is talking about but I usually ask any questions about things I'm not understanding. I can comprehend what is being said but may need a better understanding so I ask additional questions.
-1	Well i went to the hospital a lot of times when i was young due to my asthma so i have a pretty good idea of the basic information that is given to me. Anything else i would ask questions and look up anything i can online.
1	I feel that I have a very good grasp of things going on around me. I am a reasonably intelligent person.I am not afraid to ask questions if I don't understand. I believe I can obtain, process and understand basic health information quite well.
-1	"I have the capacity to obtain and understand health information, but I find doctors to be a little intimidating. So, if I have a question about my medical condition for them then I might not ask in case it is a ""stupid"" question. "
-1	I believe that I can fill out forms sufficiently enough to get the job done. However, when it comes to family history I have a hard time remembering everything that my family has told me about their medical backgrounds. I understand most of the conditions that doctors describe to me, but I have a hard time understanding the causes of them.
1	I understand basic health info easily but there are times when a doctor doesn't explain something fully or in a way I understand so I have to ask questions or just let it go if I don't think it's that important.
1	I have a pretty high capacity to understand everything regarding health information and services. I graduated high school and have a degree in college. The only difficulty I might have is hearing clearly, because I have a slight hearing loss. 
-1	I feel as if I can get basic health information and services when needed. I may have trouble when finding specialists. I ask for help from family when I run into issues where I am lost or confused.
1	I am fully capable of gathering the necessary information for my health concerns. That being said it is very difficult to obtain this information in today from doctors and nurses.
-1	I think I'm fairly well equipped to deal with all of the basic health information. However, some of it is still convoluted. The documents are frequently bordering on the cryptic and the health professionals aren't always sufficiently clear. 
-1	I really don't have much of a difficulty understanding health information.  I work as a medical technologist at a primary care hospital and since I don't know everything about health I have people around me like doctors nurses and other health professionals that can help me understand what I don't.
-1	I have the general capacity to do so. But there are mitigating factors. I have issues with anxiety and I sometimes feel too anxious to ask questions I need to ask or to bring up topics I need to discuss. On the other side, medical professionals are often rushed and sometimes distracted. So sometimes I don't have time or opportunity to discuss the issues I'd like to discuss. Also, occasionally, I have been clear and direct in my conversation and had the medical professional sort of blow right past the issue.
1	I only have one body, one life in this world. I know that doctors are not fail-proof, so I ask all the questions I need to in order to make sure I am getting the best care possible. It helps that my husband is extremely interested in our overall health and can hold an informative conversation with doctors. It makes them take us much more seriously!
-1	I have the ability to understand English. The problem is that doctors have not found a way to describe probabilities in a way that adequately captures the way we assess risk in everyday life.
-1	I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I take the time to read my health documents and records and look up information regarding my medications. If I ever have a question about something I will ask the appropriate people in order to better understand.
1	I read well and have enough basic health knowledge to understand forms and descriptions. If I have questions I feel comfortable asking a doctor or nurse to further explain until I feel I grasp the information.
-1	Even though I am not very confident about my own decisions in this matter, I think I should be able to decide for my own health choice because I think I should be able to make decision for myself.  If needed important ability for it, I should try to have any capacity to understand basic health information by asking and learning for final choice for my own health.
-1	I feel that I am quite competent in regards to understanding health information that is given to me. I worked in a hospital for many years and am comfortable around nurses and doctors. When I do not know something, I ask questions but I also do research at home on my own and then ask more questions if needed.
1	I think I'm pretty capable of understanding it. Sometimes it can be unclear what services are offered, whether and where they're covered by insurance, things like that. It's more the kind of administrative stuff that I find confusing sometimes.
-1	I feel like I usually have the capability to understand information that is presented to me but sometimes I feel as though I need further clarification or more information before I am fully able to understand what I am being told.
-1	I feel fairly confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make appropriate decisions. There have been few times I needed to ask questions for for a demonstration, but my doctor was able to provide me with the information for me to do it properly. 
1	I feel that I can understand basic health information quite well.  I rarely need further explanations or very minimal explanation.  I know when I need to ask for more information to better understand health related information.  
1	I'm fairly confident I have the ability to obtain, process, and understand health info and services due to my reading comprehension skills, question forming skills, and the general knowledge I possess.
-1	i always make sure to ask any questions I have with my doctors and nurse, even if they sound stupid.  Often times though, I will think of questions I need answered long after I've already left my doctor's visit and I have to go online and research what little I can but still be unsure of decisions.
-1	I'm for the most part somewhat aware of my health so when it comes to health and filling out forms most of the time I don't need help because I've been on top of my health and know what I need to ask and to add in a form when visiting the doctor. 
1	I feel I am fully capable of obtaining and understanding basic health information.  I have a degree in veterinary technology so I have a background in medical terminology and a basic understanding of how diseases/the body operates.
-1	I believe that I have a pretty good handle on how to handle information about information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. That being said, I've never had a serious medical condition to have to deal with.  Most things that I have ever been to a doctor for have been fairly innocuous.  I'm sure if there was a major life threatening illness or something requiring an invasive surgery I would have more questions.
-1	I feel like I am able to ask for clarification from medical professionals but am also fortunate to have a mother who worked in the medical profession who I can ask additional questions after the fact if I need additional assistance processing information.
-1	I feel I am capable of understanding any health info and services. I am competent enough to be able to process and access info on my own without help. My reasoning skills and decision making are just as good as anyone else, so I am confident in myself.
-1	I am young and of able mind. I feel confident in asking doctors and nurses questions if I don't fully understand something. 
1	I'm pretty confident that I can understand most of the important things about a particular ailment if it is explained clearly to me, and I will be able to research the ailment and find more information about it on my own.  
1	I feel that I have the background to understand what they are telling me. I have a bachelor's degree in science, I grew up surrounded by scientific people, I read medical and science-oriented articles on a regular basis. I think I have a certain degree of skepticism, but also a good deal of faith in the medical people I come in contact with.
-1	I think I have the information to do it. If I have a problem, I will call the doctor's office or pharmacist and have them explain any difficult terms for me. I will also Google the issue and hopefully come up with something to help me. I can always ask for help via phone call or email if needed.
-1	I feel that I have the resources it takes to understand basic health information. I make sure to ask questions when I see a health professional. I also have access to the Internet to do research on anything that I am uncertain about. I fill out my own medical forms and help others fill out their medical forms. Family members often ask me for assistance when it comes to understanding forms or information provided by their doctors and other health professionals. If I have any questions, I know who to ask for help, or where to do my own research for clarification. 
1	I feel that all the information is available.  Most important is to be completely honest with the doctor and do proper research.  Googling an answer is not the best way to get information.  Proper research into peer reviewed papers from the top of each prospective field is necessary.  This is not to discount the information that is obtainable by each doctor.  These professionals know more about your individual circumstances than anyone.  It is important to ask for and get information from many different resources.  So, in total I would say that I have a good understanding, am able to process and am able to access the necessary information to better inform and care for my needs.  I do however feel that with all the in formation available, there is a tendency to miss use or miss diagnose oneself.  Although very dangerous, this can be solved by trusting the professionals with all of the relevant information.
1	I have a high degree of understanding basic health information along with many search options to understand any medical service or procedure required.  Have copies of all health insurance documents and costs.  
-1	i feel that i i sometimes have issues obtaining medical information solely becasue im unfamiliar with the process i would go about to obtain it. I work in health care so im familiar with documentation and how its processed on a very basic level. However this is for the patients that i aid in the care of, and not my own medical forms. 
1	I recently had numbness in my right toe due to a pressure on my L5S2, occurring from when I had to lift a 300lb person after finding them intentionally overdosed. When I realized that the problem wasn't circulatory - neither bathing in warm water nor going for a walk helped - I hit up urgent care. When I arrived, I succinctly described my issues as above. They immediately send for a neurologist, because they could rule out other causes due to my ability to explain in sufficient terms. I also grew up with my grandparents due to a shit parent, so I had to help them understand pharmaceutical interactions.
1	Having recently experienced some health issues, I feel extremely confident that I can obtain and understand health information. I ask a lot of questions of the doctor and/or nurse. I also have access to my health providers' portal on-line, and I'm not shy about questioning the doctor. I take my health very seriously and I seek out everything I can get my hands on.
1	I feel as though I can take care of my medical needs without assistance from others.  I am able to read the information they give me, google if necessary and come back with a list of questions if needed. 
-1	I feel that I am fairly confident in medical related things. Though there are some far more knowledgeable my certificate in Medical Assisting helps to understand what they are talking about and my work in the medical field helps me imply what I know. 
1	I feel that I am extremely capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I am fully able to either understand the information I'm given or ask questions about it until I am comfortable that I understand sufficiently. I've been doing this for a long time for family members as well as myself. I also have experience selling health insurance and worked with the case management and customer service departments to advocate for the members so I was exposed to a lot of technical information which increased my capacity for understanding the terms used.
1	I have no difficulty understanding medical information. I am really good at learning, so I always ask everything possible when I see a doctor or nurse.

If something is complicated or vague, I always check with a medical professional about it.

So I have had my share of procedures and Doctors in the past couple months. I can honestly say I do not have to have someone go with me as I can understand everything they say. Of course it also depends on the Doctor and if he will take the time to explain. I am at 69 very capable of understanding and managing my own health care!

1	I'm pretty confident in my ability to understand and process whatever information doctors or nurses tell me and if I Have any doubts I always ask for clarification. If I am not satisfied with a response I ask again or look it up online to get more information. Understanding basic health information is really not a problem for me at all.
1	I have the right to ask because itâs dealing with my health. You got to understand whatâs going on with you and itâs okay to ask even if you donât know whatâs going
1	In terms of my own ability, I do have pretty easy access to my doctor and obtaining help that does not require me to go into the office or schedule an appointment. As long as the question isn't complicated or require that physical presence. My mother is also a nurse so that really helps a lot if I do not have access to my doctor at the time. 
-1	I have 100% confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services. If I do not understand anything, I will ask until my understanding is sufficient. 
1	I feel like I have enough knowledge to understand my health information and if there's ever something I don't understand I know what to do in order to obtain the information I need.  If I don't understand something I can always go to a relative or search online for more answers.
1	I usually feel like I can get the information I need, but I oiften worry that I don't have the expertise to understand all of it and get all the answers to questions I need. I'm not sure all of the time, and worry I won't know how to handle a condition - even though I really don't have anything wrong at this point in my life.
1	I feel fairly confident that I am able to navigate most healthcare situations in order to get the information I need.  I have rarely had any sort of complications when going to a doctor's office, pharmacy, clinic, or hospital on the occasions I have had to go.  If there is a question I have, I tend to almost always ask when I am at the doctor's.
-1	I feel like I do have the capacity to obtain all the info that I need. It depends if I am intimidated by the doctor or the doctor is busy
1	Being an educated person, who can read, write, and comprehend, I feel confident that I can make decisions on my own, or with minimal help from others. Being involved in your own healthcare is very important.
1	I am confident that I am competent to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have a degree in nursing.
-1	I believe I have the capacity to understand some of the basics about health care.  The doctors and nurses do not take enough time, though to fully answer questions.  I feel like I'm on an assembly line when I go to the docs\ter.
-1	I feel I have a reasonable ability to make basic health decisions. I feel as though I understand most of what I'm told by my doctor or can ask for help if I don't understand. That said, sometimes it is embarrassing to admit what I don't know, so I might use Google to get the information I need instead of asking the doctor.
-1	I think I can understand most of what I am told.  If not I will ask for a clearer explanation and if I don't get it I will look it up and try to find out more about it.
-1	"I know that my doctor and every other healthcare provider I encounter are motivated by money and pressure from insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. Often I want to ask my doctor things like, ""how much would you profit if I do this procedure you are suggesting?"" Or, ""did a sales rep promise you a trip to a conference in a vacation destination if you prescribe this drug?"" But, blunt questioning about conflicts of interest is likely to antagonize a doctor and his guilty conscience, so I stay quiet. "
1	I think I can find any information I need fairly well. I am able to understand the majority of it and I can remember what I discover quite well.
1	I feel I have the capacity to process the information. I usually think about what I want to talk to the doctor about. Also I try to inform myself about the condition ahead of time. I truly listen to the doctor and when I feel I need to ask a question, I do interrupt and ask a question. 
-1	My mother is a nurse so when it comes to 'medical talk' I usually have an understanding of where my doctor/nurse is going. I am also very capable of understanding what is being said to me. I make sure that i am asking appropriate questions if for some reason i don't understand something. But for most of the time, I do understand basic health information that is given.
1	I am very confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and service whether that information is being given to me by a doctor, nurse, or hospital so that I can make appropriate health decisions.
-1	I feel like I am very capable of understanding any health information that providers give to me. However, my recent experience has been that providers may give you conflicting information and may be highly unavailable to answer questions and communicate poorly in general. For example, my husband has high blood pressure and his old PCP said to try to reduce salt, while his neurologist said that salt intake doesn't matter. In our community, we have facilities run by Banner, and our experiences has been that these doctors have poor communication and don't feel bothered to answer questions or return phone calls. 
-1	I believe I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions to a very high degree being a medical professional myself and being married to a healthcare provider
1	I am very capable of receiving, giving and understanding information to and from my medical practitioners and facilities. The information can be overwhelming if you have something major going on so it's always good to have someone you can count on to help if there is an emergent situation.
1	I feel I have an average degree of knowledge about obtaining and understanding health information needed for myself and family members. I believe my family doctor will provide me with information and would be able to help me understand anything that I did not. Also doing my own research on the internet or could provide information and explanations. 
-1	I feel like I'm capable of handling tasks at hand when I need too. If I need to ask questions I will, and if I do not understand I will speak up. But I'm sure I can understand them regardless.
1	I feel like I'm mostly able to understand basic health information. I'm comfortable with forms and written information. To the extent I have some minor problems, there are times when my mental health issues act up and make it difficult for me to be assertive about asking questions or correcting assumptions. That's pretty rare, though.
-1	I feel confident i can access the information regarding my health and/or easily find someone who can help me understand. 
-1	Oddly, my father is in the hospital this very week with kidney failure and pneumonia and I had to provide end of life, resuscitation information and fill out a great deal of forms in the past 7 days. My mother is a nurse and I've grown up around health care professionals so I have a lot of personal resources I can draw on if I have questions, I also feel I'm fairly intelligent and can do my homework on the internet to ask relevant questions and look  up issues and procedures after I talk to a health care professional to be fully informed. 
-1	I feel confident I can obtain, process and understand basic health information. I have worked in a medical environment with physicians for years so am familiar with much of the terminology.
1	I feel that when I go to the doctor I understand how to fill out the forms given. I understand the things that the doctor is trying to tell me. If I don't know a certain aspect of something I ask question so that I will have a better understanding of it. That being said I feel that I can adequately have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	For the most part I've had no problem understanding anything involved with going to see a doctor, but I have had to ask for help to understand health insurance.
-1	I feel that I have the ability to make most of the basic common health information and services that I may need. Outside of that, I think depending on the issue it would be much more difficult to obtain what I needed by myself. 
-1	I often obtain the information I need to understand and maintain my health in such a condition, that I am not a nuisance to myself and my loved ones. Sometimes healthcare providers resist. They don't have time for me, they have too many patients, they don't care, etc. That's a sign for me to find a better healthcare provider.
1	I think I have a very good capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I generally take time to read through medical information that is provided and ask any questions I might have to my doctor or nurse to fully understand the material.
1	I feel that I have the necessary skills to understand medical information. I can easily get the information I need by researching online, asking the right questions and continuing to be an advocate for my own health. 
1	I feel I have a decent grasp on what questions I should ask my doctor when I'm going in for a physical. If I have any questions I will sometimes do some research online before going in to get an idea of what others have had questions about so that I can make certain I don't miss anything. 
1	I definitely think I have the capacity and the confidence to ask questions when necessary. I make all of my own health decisions, so it's important to be well-informed.
-1	I feel like I obtain most basic health information but it is very hard to process and understand the information. I feel like I already make appropriate health decisions, but when a doctor sits down and tries to tell me what is wrong with me and what I should do about it it can sometimes get very confusing. I have never understood why doctors use technical terms with regular people because a regular person has no idea what the doctor is saying half of the time. If a doctor were to sit down with me and slowly explain what is going on in regular, every day terms, I would might understand better what is wrong with me whenever I go to the doctors office.
1	I feel I have the full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I can under my doctor, ask the questions I need answered, and take the action necessary.
-1	To make the appropriate health decisions  and understand basic health information  I feel like I'm pretty confident I could handle it by myself.  Sometimes if I do need help I will just find somebody and have them explain it to me.   I would say 75% of the time I could figure it out.  However I never sign anything that I do not fully understand. Because me and my wife work separate shifts  I have no choice to go to the doctors myself and fill everything else as well as take my 2 children to the doctors and fill their information out.   Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%. Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%
-1	Well recently I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and my doctor just gave me a pamphlet. I was not sure what to ask or what the next steps were and it was not explained to me either.   I felt like this was pretty serious and me having no knowledge of it should have been explained in detail but it was not. I would have to say i would really have to experience in obtaining information when it comes to my basic health information or what exactly i should be doing. I would rather hear it from a doctor then to have to google what i should be doing. 
-1	usually when i have a health problem and visit a doctor, I give all the symtoms to the doctor and try to explain them as detailed as possible and ask all the doubts i have without any hesitation and when any form is to be filled out I usually need a help as i dont understand all the things asked for and complete the form.
1	I believe that it is fairly easy for me to access and understand my medical plan. I have freedom to make educated decisions regarding my health.
1	I work in a pharmacy, therefore I feel that I understand more than that average person may concerning health and medicine. I've also always been intrigued by health care and things of that sort.
1	I can certainly obtain, process and understand basic health information and services. I don't feel I'm at the point where I need help with this. If there is something I don't understand, I do ask questions. 
1	Yes i know about all these things because when I was young my mom and dad taught me everything I need to know about my health and things of such.
-1	I feel like I am constantly having to look up information about my medical health on my own, like on Google, and I'm having to make sense of it all on my own. Also, many times doctors seem like they don't know, until I search it and tell them about it and then they look into. This is so stressful for me. 
-1	I feel like I have a fairly average capacity to process and understand basic health information as long as it doesn't get too technical about the medicinal or diagnostic aspect of it. I do feel fairly confident in my ability to make decisions based on this information. I feel more hesitant about my ability to obtain such information, as due to anxiety I find it difficult to ask relevant questions in real time. 
-1	I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the materials and services presented to me, though sometimes it can be confusing. 
-1	If I am given a document to read, I can understand most of not all of it, and if I have any questions regarding the document, I am able to ask the doctor or an employee about it. Sometimes if I am asked an open-ended question (for example, if everything has been okay since my last visit), I tend to err on the side of not mentioning what I consider small or irrelevant problems. Overall though, I feel confident about my ability to get the information and services needed to make decisions about my health.
1	I feel that being a well-educated person who was a caregiver for an elderly family member that I have a strong knowledge of health and medical information. If I am uncertain about a medical condition or a decision, I feel I have the necessary research capability to find the necessary answers or resources. 
-1	I went to a new primary doctor recently and I felt rushed. I told him a few of the health issues I was concerned with but not everything. I did get a referral for one health problem but I feel I have to make more appointments to address more problems. 
1	I am a young adult male at the prime off my life. I am quite healthy and have little need for additional help. 
-1	I believe that i have full capacity to obtain, process. and understand basic health information. If I do not know the answer I can usually get it, and then understand it. However, there are some instances in which everything is way over my head, but for the most part, I feel competent.

-1	I feel pretty confident understanding medical information given to me and i am not shy about asking for help if need be. i also know that not all doctors know everything, so i have also done independent research into various topics. so far, i have been lucky to have good doctors and nurses.
-1	I typically understand what they are telling me, but I find that my biggest problem is remembering it all. A lot of times I will only remember 2 or 3 things we talked about and forget the rest. This becomes a problem because I can't put all the pieces together and remember the entire conversation and how it all relates to each other. 
-1	I feel like I am very capable of obtaining, processing and understanding most basic health information. I sometimes need help understanding how some medical diagnoses affect me, but otherwise, I am competent enough.

-1	I think I have the capacity to understand basic health information but I do often check things out online and by doing so, it can often make me question things that the doctor or nurse have told me.  I think the more I research, the more confusing it is and I then almost want to question the doctor or nurse about certain facts they are telling me.
-1	I feel confident in my ability to understand what I'm told by my doctor.  I am also proactive in researching anything that I may not understand or didn't think to ask and  ask follow up questions.  I've never felt as though I left without obtaining and understanding information I was given.
-1	When it comes to basic health information and services I am fairly confident in my ability to handle everything myself without issue. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate myself around 7 or 8, where 10 means fully confident.

-1	I'm usually pretty good about acquiring information/help when i visit a doctor but i often have really bad anxiety when consulting on medical manners, so that makes it difficult unless i have someone to provide moral and information support along with me during visits.
-1	I definately have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  However, I do have difficulty trying to have discussions on this health information with my health care providers.   He would rather joke and laugh, then be available to answer questions.  And if I call on phone, I cannot get a hold of a knowledgable person.
1	I think I have an above average ability to obtain, process and understand health information.  I've been working in medical offices and/or doing medical transcription for many years.  
-1	"I feel like it is very stressful and takes a long time to get someone to explain certain simple medical things/information to me, just for instance at my endocrinologists office (I am pre-diabetic), the nurse doesn't even know basic diabetic information such as what level your A1C should be to not be pre-diabetic or diabetic, she states she only draws the blood - but my doctors assistant is the same way, they do not know basic info for that field when I believe they should to save time for the doctor and also be able to explain it to you. My doctors sometimes do not use ""layman"" terms - they use long huge medical terms and don't really dissect it for you to understand, which leaves you to google which can be a severe panic attack in the making to do your own research."
-1	I feel to a certain extent I understand most health information but usually seek help from experts to make important decisions when it comes to my health. There's so much information out there, so many terms, that it can be difficult at times.
-1	I feel I can understand basic information given to me but I do sometimes have a problem obtaining information when I need it from my providers. I also don't always have the time to ask certain questions. I ask what I can but sometimes I will think of something later and by then there's no one to ask
-1	I think that I have capacity to manage all the information but in any real situation I often miss some information, do not feel confident to make connection between the health issues and what is important to share with the doctor. I forget some health issues from the past, After a visit I need time to rethink everything again and to talk to the doctor but nobody has that time, I read a lot of health articled and follow famous health blogger, knowing some information I feel confused because sometimes I see conflict between the information I know and the doctor's opinion. I would like everything to be consistent and logically understandable but it is not. In some of the cases doctors are working with old knowledge, and they do not make connection between the health problems and prefer to focus on one instead of the total picture.
1	I can completely understand information pertaining to my medical conditions. I also make sure to bring my spouse to any important appointments so that we both hear the information and so he can ask questions if I don't think of one. 
1	I think I have the full capability to make my own decisions regarding my own care. I think if any problems arose, I would be able to handle them in full. 
1	I can generally understand the information given to me by my physician.  Whenever I am not sure, I will ask him or his nurse to explain it in laymen's terms.  I usually do  research on my own as well, and get a second opinion on methods of treatment I am not sure of.
-1	I feel like I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate decisions regarding my health in a high degree.
-1	I can understand and fill out quite a lot about my own health. I have been doing that ever since I was a kid. My parents did not help me much as they do not speak English very well. So I even had to fill out their medical form when they are at a hospital or just a simple doctor visit. Thus, I have more experience about this than anyone in my family. Plus, I want to know the condition of my health or any of my family health thoroughly. I don't want to miss out any little details that would delay the healing process. 
-1	Obtaining and understanding information had become easier since the invention of search engines. Asking this of my physician is sometimes difficult. At times I feel and embarrassed asking the Dr to go over what I donât understand.
-1	I think I have a decent chance at understanding health material as it pertains to my own health and conditions. Occasionally, I find things confusing and I try to get an explanation from the doctor or nurses. However, they sometimes have a difficult time explaining medical terminology in terms that average people can understand. If I am unable to get the answers I need, I often rely on the internet to clear up confusion. Unfortunately, the internet does not always have the correct information about certain health issues and this can cause more issues in the long run. That is why I always try to get good information from the source, like the doctors or nurses themselves. 
1	I feel that I have the ability to understand basic health information and services. If I am unsure about something I will typically ask the doctor or one of his nurses to clarify, in the event that i don't ask them to explain further I will usually read up on the subject online. I can't recall a time when I have had difficulty understanding medical information. 
-1	I feel that I have a high capacity for learning about and understanding such things. I worked very closely to medical professionals while doing medical registration and billing for a while and also had a very strong interest in neurobiology, anatomy, medical diagnoses, and pharmacological pursuits just to scratch the surface. I'm quite sure I can make appropriate decisions concerning my health.
-1	I'm the type of person that if I not understand something that they are telling to me or something that I read over and over again and I no understand I ask until I'm capable of help myself or help others. I prefer to ask I have the knowledge and help that don't ask and make a mistake.
-1	I am capable of understanding what the doctor is telling me, if they are giving me basic information about my health.  But when I suffered from a serious condition almost dying and having stayed in the hospital for a month, to this day they never clearly explained why I had the emergency.   I keep having to take test after test that makes no sense to me but they never clearly explain the problem.  I guess they just don't have an answer.  
-1	I don't think I'm that great at it.  I typically search stuff on the internet and get myself overly worried about it.  Then I do ask questions of the medical staff but usually it's kinda brushed off.  I do ask questions a lot which they probably don't like, and I try not to come off as a know it all because I definitely see them as the experts.  
-1	I feel pretty capable.  I can mostly handle it on my own, but I do need help with medical terms some times.
-1	I am an injured veteran. So most of my care comes from the VA hospital. I do feel like I have the capacity to understand quite a bit, but sometimes my doctor isn't always available to answer my questions. In the past, I have also had many issues with misdiagnoses and am honestly not 100% sure what causes many of my issues. Several different doctors have told me different things, so I'm not sure what is right, and what is wrong.
-1	I think every time you try to obtain medical information in a clear and understandable manner, it is a challenge. I ask a lot of questions, but I seldom get the straight answers I desire and feel I deserve. What I am often forced to do is find another company or provider that handles this process more efficiently and thoroughly.
-1	Since I have a good grasp of medical wording, and I am willing to do my research and ask questions, I feel confident that I can make appropriate health decisions. Since I don't everything about the medical world and medical conditions, I would say I'm confident and not very confident
-1	I believe that if I do not understand something about my health I have the ability to ask health experts the right questions. I am usually capable of understanding the benefits and risks of any course of treatment. I am capable of understanding the costs also. Overall I think I can make informed decisions.
1	I feel I am highly capable mostly because I have worked within the medical field and psychiatric field for the past twenty years.  
-1	I can easily obtain, process and understand basic health information.  When it comes to major health information, it is a bit harder to understand as the words the doctors utilize are harder to  understand.
1	I feel I have the capacity to make appropriate health related decisions under my control.  The only time I need help is if there is something that I don't understand, and in those times I ask for some extra information from someone that knows.  This could be filling out documents, a question about paperwork, treatments, etc. 
-1	I feel like I can comprehend the information to a certain extent. I tend to go through it with someone I trust to make sure I understand the information and that I'm not missing anything. I feel like I have the capacity, but still rely on others to help me. 
-1	I feel fairly capable of understanding, and obtaining the proper information related to my healthcare and any conditions I might have. My background in partial medical helps me to better understand things than most, however, this can sometimes lead to me not asking questions that I should because I believe I understand something when I might not have the full (or most up-to-date) information on the subject matter. But as a whole, I find I am capable of understanding, and asking enough questions to get the information I need to decide and understand what care is being offered.
-1	I feel that I have some capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information based on my own intellectual capabilities. However, I am pretty educated and still find some information confusing and hard to understand. I feel that I have a limited ability to make health decisions based on what I can understand, but there are still things that I need to ask for clarification about. 
-1	I am extremely intelligent. I can read and comprehend what I read. Even though I don't claim to know everything, but I know enough to fill out a medical form with my information on it.
-1	I feel I have a high degree of knowledge obtaining,processing, and understanding basic health information. This is due to my experiences. 
-1	Due to the group of people that I have around me to support me, I have no problem getting medical information without having to go through my doctor.  Generally I do not easily make health decisions for myself and use this group of people close to me to help.
-1	I understand what is common knowledge. Some medical terms stump me,.. others are common sense. I think that if i look up a few things i would be able to process and understand the basic information to help me make the appropriate decisions. 
1	I believe I have the basic ability to grasp all the health information that I receive. If for some reason I donât understand something fully I am sure o ask all appropriate questions. I do not feel stupid asking any questions. Because if there is something I donât understand I need to know because it is concerning my health. I have love ones to help me also and there always is the internet as the last resort.
-1	Usually if the doctors use big word terms for things, its difficult to understand. But explaining it or using different terms can help my understanding of things and I'm able to figure out what is happening to me.
1	I feel I have a general understanding of information on my health. If there is any information, I do not understand, I make sure to ask questions until I am confident that I understand. 
-1	Well, I'm not mentally disabled. I therefore *can* do it. I don't sometimes understand medical terminology, which for some reason medical personnel seem wont to use when speaking to non-medical personnel, and often I can't be bothered to have a conversation about it. If it seems important, I'll make the effort; otherwise, it doesn't really matter.
-1	Most of the time I understand what I am being told. About 2%, I have issues understanding what actually is wrong or causing the issue, I think this is more due to a language barrier.
-1	I think I do. I worked as a pharmacy tech for a while, so I had to know what I was doing for basic health information. It helps me make any choices I need to make as far as health concerns go.

1	I feel I have the capacity to understand all health-related documents almost every time I read one. I take time to read the directions/information and ensure there are is not any ambiguous wording. I am able to understand all of the necessary abilities that I need to get the information, how to process it in my mind to think about and determine what is needed from me whether medical records, insurance or even authorizations that I need to give to other healthcare providers or to other people. I understand that the doctors use the information I truthfully give them in order to make detailed decisions about my personal health. If I am ever unclear on what decision is being made about my health, I make sure to ask the doctor  - even if it has to be asked in multiple different ways for me to understand.
1	I sometimes have problems with forms, but I can always ask the receptionist for clarity. I have no issues understanding procedures and so forth. 
1	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.

Its important to me to make the best decisions so I try to get information from different sources.

-1	From the age of six, when my father carried me into an Arkansas emergency room, I have been intrigued with medicine.

At the age of 42, I enrolled in some basic medical classes, just to see if I would really enjoy the subject.
-1	I would say to a very, very small degree. Everything about the process is puzzling to me and unless it's something basic (ie something like a simple cold), then I'll have am extremely hard time understanding.

Usually I have to rely on my doctor, mother or partner to assist me in understand the information and making decisions.

Since I lack this technical knowledge, I usual ask the doctor, a friend in the medical field, as well as the pharmacist about the prescribed medication.  
-1	Before I go to the Doctors office or Hospital, I research all of my symptoms to see if I can figure it out myself. If it is something that I can not determine I will go to the doctors office or emergency room for the proper attention of the matter. While I am in the appropriate place, if I do not know what is going on, I will ask questions to understand what is going on, so I can make the best decision for  myself.

After going home, if I have any follow-up questions, I will call to get assistance.

I oversee my elderly parents' medical care, requiring me to stay relatively current on a multitude of medical specialties. 
1	I have a graduate degree. Although I have never had any medical training, I am familiar with the meanings of many medical terms. I have also studied Latin, and learned the Latin derivation of many terms. I once volunteered in a medical clinic, and learned terminology from a doctor there. He encourage me to go to medical school.
-1	I have a lot of trust in my doctors and will ask them to explain anything I don't understand. I'm also always free to call their nurses and assistants and they are always happy to be helpful. I'm good at researching things I might need to know as well, so I always feel I'm well informed when I need to make a decision.
1	i feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make decisions for myself.  i have no problem understanding any information received from a doctor, and often do my own research online. 
-1	I'm competent, just as much as the average person. I know the basics about health to relate any problems and I've had enough experience getting hurt on how to either treat it or find someone who will treat it.
-1	I currently am injured and disabled and have been in this state for over 2 years. I see a doctor once a month minimum and see multiple doctors, physicians and health care professionals. Since i have been dealing with this type of stuff so frequently I have a pretty good grip on health care forms. The information gets a little more complicated as I have multiple doctors working with me and they all have a different opinion so in that regard i usually require more information from each individual doctor because I get so much new information every time. Deciding which services are needed is also a little more difficult since my problem falls into the chronic pain category so no one really knows exactly what to do to treat my problem so this gets a little tricky too since everything seems like a guess to see what works and what doesn't work.
-1	I feel confident when i interact with the medical service providers like doctors and nurses  and ask them to clarify if anything is complex to understand,  in some instances I may need some help if i am filling up or reading the content related to medical condition 
1	I feel very confident in my ability to understand necessary health information. I also am competent on researching symptoms via the internet.  Overall, while I am not an expert by any stretch, I feel like I have a very good grasp on my health and what impacts my health.
-1	I feel that I can be able to get the help I need to process and understand information, but I do feel I miss out on a lot of information. I feel that when you go in doctors and nurses are on such push for time that the rush through a lot of the information. The often hand you paperwork when you first walk in that the rush you through. Next doctor are handing you paper work and talking really fast because the are behind schedule  and you are still try to process everything they just told you.
-1	I feel as though I am adequately empowered to make my own decisions when it comes to my health. In several instances, however, I have been complacent with what my doctors suggest despite not fully understanding my diagnosis.
1	I feel completely in control of my health decisions.   I can read all the documents, fill out my forms and I ask questions as necessary. 
1	I feel that while I may not know the right questions to ask in a medical situation, I have the capability and knowledge to get the information I need to make health decisions. I am of sound mind and can fill out my own forms without feeling the need to fabricate or gloss over my medical history.
1	"While I may not know that I am not asking a certain, necessary question of a doctor or nurse, it's simply because I don't know or understand enough. It's not that I'm not capable of understanding what the doctor/nurse is saying, It's just that I don't know I need to ask. I also issues with ""making waves"" so I will sometimes just ""go along to get along."" I do have a wife, who loves to ""make waves"" and a mother-in-law who is a nurse with nearly 40 years experience so even when I do miss something, one of them will usually understand it or figure it out."
-1	I am semi confident, I dont have alot of experience dealing with doctors so it is a little intimidating and I may not understand everything they are asking for or explaining. I feel like if I were to receive some type of document that was not completely clear I would ask for clarification regarding the questions. Maybe some of the terms used would not be something I know and dont want to sound dumb and would ignore but really important things such as conditions I may have or steps I need to follow I would ensure a clear answer from my doctor.
-1	I do not always feel confident that I am getting sufficient information from my doctor or nurse, so I always follow up with reputable medical websites. I especially find it important to review medication information because no one ever explains side effects.
1	I feel that I am in a stable state of mind and am physically sound enough to deal with any condition I face. And as such I will be able to fully grasp and understand from my doctor what needs to be done of me to deal with the condition and fix it.
-1	I have my B.S. in Biology. I went to the college health center quite a bit and go to the doctor now for regular checkups where we have candid talk about whatever health issues might be occurring. 
-1	My family physician goes above and beyond to spend plenty of time with me during my visits. He makes sure I understand everything being said. Also, I am very versed in internet searches and know I can find a lot of useful information there.
1	I am a bookworm who loves to read, I've been like this ever since I was a child. Therefore, reading and comprehending information, medical included, is not a problem for me.
-1	I feel that my abilities are more or less on par with the majority of the population. If I am given the tools and a rough idea of how they are used I feel I would have the capacity to navigate them. I would know where to find them or at the least who to ask to find out where to obtain them. I would have no issues processing or understanding them unless they used a lot of jargon. If they information was relevant it would likely help me make a health related choice.
-1	I have a problem with it cause i got my disease at 12 and my mom always helped me with my medical conditions so i have a hard time expressing things with doctors. So i am trying to get better on making my own decisions 
-1	I feel like I am experienced enough to understand things.Also I have a history working in the Medical field and I feel like it can be helpful to me in my personal situation.
-1	I do not feel like I have a strong ability to understand medical health information that is to be provided to me. I always find myself getting help from someone. I do not want the chance of misinterpreting something. I take it very seriously when it comes to money and health.
-1	I feel fully capable of taking charge of my own health and that the current system gives me, as a native speaker and well-educated person, what I need
-1	I feel like I can understand if the Doctors / nurses take the time to explain it.  If they don't I look things up on the internet.  It can become confusing because there is so much information available online.  It is hard to get the Doctor to spend more than a few minutes with you.
-1	I feel like I have a lot of capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
-1	I consider myself to be smart so I can say that it is easy for me to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 
1	I am intelligent and I am good at coming to understandings and learning on my own how and why things work. Because of this I feel that I definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.
1	I feel fairly competent in obtaining, processing and understanding the basic health information and services I need to in order to make appropriate health decisions. That being said, I find that I tend to get very emotional about health concerns during doctors' visits such that I don't think clearly. Hence, I often draw a blank when it comes to asking questions and so on. Once I'm at home and I become calm, I find that I can think about and articulate questions regarding the health information and services necessary.
1	When I go to the doctor, I prepare for what I want to know about whatever it is that I am experiencing.  I write down symptoms having, blood pressure taken at home, and any questions I have. 
1	I think I have above average competence and ability to understand things.  I will generally do internet research on my own before seeing a doctor so I have a better understanding.  I generally do not need any assistance.  If I have questions I try to remember or write them down to ask the doctor.  Sometimes the doctors are too rushed and busy during an appointment.  That is very frustrating.  I am the type of person who wants to understand and ask a lot of questions.  At the same time, I am very intelligent and understand things quickly, as well as do my own research ahead of time in order to not waste time during the appointment.  Nevertheless, the doctors many times do rush me or make me feel that they are not interested in answering my questions.  The scariest thing is when they do not have the answers to my questions or are dismissive of my concerns or when I am using supplements that work that they have never heard of.
-1	am an adult. i do understand what the doctors say. i understand if there is a problem i am responsible and i should have all the rights to obtain any information regarding my health. that is how i can take decisions based on what is really the problem an how will it affect me
-1	I have a good understanding of my past medical procedures, allergies and current conditions.  I can convey this on the new patient or similar forms so the doctor can get my background.  I try to ask questions of the doctor when he comes up with a recommended treatment plan.  I use email correspondence with my doctor to follow up on any tests or labs. I primarily use Kaiser for my health care which stores all my medical records for easy access to any doctor. In fact, I recently moved to CO from CA, and the new Kaiser physician was able to transfer all my records locally. For prescriptions, I try to read about all the side effects and watch for them.
1	I feel that I have the ability to learn and digest new information pertaining to making health decisions, because I listen to doctors, as well as research on my own.  
-1	I think i have a pretty decent capacity. I don't know much because I don't fall sick often and therefore my contact with doctors is very rare
1	I feel that i am able to completely understand any information that is given to me by my primary care provider. I may not understand all of the terminology or how to pronounce many of the medications generic names, however i haven't had any problem comprehending any medical information that has been explained to me.
1	Yes, I do.  However, even though I recently retired from 35 years of Nursing, I had real difficulty getting needed information when my mom broke her leg.  In most cases, I am able to figure out what questions to ask, or how to get further information.
-1	I feel that I get the information that I need to take care of myself. I sometimes do not feel that I can tell everything that is wrong with me as I feel sometimes that dr are judging me and I get shy about bringing things up to them.
-1	I usually understand enough information when given the appropriate materials to read. On some occasions, the terms are not all in plain English; but I usually ask questions if I feel it is vital to comprehend the enclosed.

1	I feel extremely confident in my ability to obtain and understand health information, whether obtained directly from a health care professional or from written literature.
-1	I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand what I need to do for my health. The problems that I have had in the process usually have been because the doctors don't have enough time for me or don't care explain anything because they think their patients are too dumb to understand. 
1	I feel very competent to voice my concerns and questions with my health care providers.   If I don't understand something I have no problems asking them to repeat or put in laymans terms so that I can understand better. 
-1	I feel pretty confident when it comes to understanding basic health information. I took a few medical assistant classes in college because I was studying to be a medical assistant a few years ago. One of the classes was about understanding basic health information and also what some abbreviations and other important terms mean. It was a fun class. I feel that with my knowledge in this field, from school, that I have a little bit of an advantage compared to others when it comes to understanding basic health information and services. There is still some things I am probably not familiar with as I didn't get a degree in this field because I switched majors, but I feel that, overall, I have a pretty strong confidence and understanding in this area. 
-1	I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. The problem is whether I am informed enough to make appropriate health decisions regardless of how many questions I ask. If I need to know something it should be TOLD to me, and if I need a procedure immediately it should be scheduled immediately instead of them ignoring me for a month and setting up an entirely different procedure without consulting anyone before a different doctor tells me that I needed something different the whole time.
1	I know I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand all the basic health information and services that I need to make all the appropriate health decisions for myself and for my loved ones.  Recently, I have had to make health decisions for myself and I understood all that was necessary to make those decisions.

1	I feel I have a large capacity to deal with basic health information. Although I have never studied medicine, I follow developments in the field and enjoy reading professional journals. Though much of it goes over my head I feel I have a good understanding of medical conditions and possible treatments. I especially like to go to the doctor knowing in advance what he may say. Allows for a more detailed discussion.
1	I believe that I am knowledgeable enough to understand what my doctor or nurse is telling me as well as reading the materials they give to me.  If I do not understand something, I have no issue asking for clarification.  I helped with my father's medical care up through his death as well and I was his proxy.
1	I am a former hospital RN. I left the field more than 30 years ago so I'm out of touch but I have enough training to know how to do research. What I don't have is the confidence to speak with doctors about what's bothering me, mainly because none of the ones I've seen so far have been interested, plus I always get the feeling that I'm taking up time that they don't have much of. It's very frustrating.
-1	Sometimes I feel that I do not have a sufficient understanding of medical terminology to express to a doctor the concerns or problems I am having in a way that will help them to focus their treatment. I feel that often doctors are using a trial and error method of prescribing treatment and think that much of it could be because I am not communicating to them effectively.
-1	I believe I do have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions.  Sometimes, though, there are terms that are used on medical forms or prescription papers that are hard to understand.  So, I may need to get advice from the doctor or someone around me to help me understand, exactly what the papers are saying.
1	I feel like there is enough information available online that most people can do research and gather adequate information to make relatively accurate decisions regarding their health without consulting professionals.

-1	I can understand most of what I am told about my health from my doctors. If I don't understand something, then I will ask for further clarification. I am well aware of what my healthcare providers are communicating to me. I can make health decisions on my own, for the most part.
1	I am competent  to understand the written and oral word of a medical practitioner. The only time I have had any problem is understanding why I have to take a certain medication. At first I got a lot of medical jargon that any layman would not understand. I made the doctor slow down and put it into plain English. I am still not totally satisfied with his answer not because I did not understand but I am suspect about the basic premise.
-1	As far as basic information, I think I can do OK.  I don't currently have any medical conditions and have not had any serious ones so far.  I am alright at looking up information online, but I know not to immediately think that my condition is too serious since most symptoms have some rare disease or issue that is fatal or life threatening.
1	I beleive I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I ask questions and listen very well.
-1	I feel that I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. I think obtaining the health information and services are easy to acquire through the 24 hour call service I have and through internet searches. Processing the information is easy as well as long as I can have time to process. It's understanding that will is sometimes harder but I'm still able to understand basic information. Through all the resources I have available for myself I believe that it's easy for me to make appropriate health decisions. 
-1	I believe with my schooling I have taken I could understand and process basic information. Once you get into more complex and unusually diagnosis is when I can no longer comprehend what is going on. I also have anxiety that does not allow me to fully process what the doctor is saying completely and I leave with only half of the information that was said. 
-1	I feel like I can understand it pretty well after I do some research. When my doctor did testing for thyroid problems, I went home after the appointment and did a ton of research on it before I ever got the results. I wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting into. When she gave me meds, I went home to find out if there would be any side effects from it. 
-1	I feel as though I can understand basic health related information and instructions to an acceptable degree. If I am unsure of a certain medication or task given to me, I will usually consult a family member or go online for assistance. When it comes to making appropriate health decisions, I try to use common sense, although if I am unsure of something, I will usually use the internet for help. 
1	I feel confident in reading and understanding medical information that is spelled out for non medical professionals. I feel that I have basic understanding of health related issues. 
1	I am quite confident that I can understand the health information that is given to me by various health professionals.

To date I have not had any problems understanding the materials especially as they may apply to me.
-1	I believe I can understand forms that are written in layman's terms. I can read through medical material and glean relevant information.
1	I feel very capable of understanding information that is presented to me, and also in performing research about the issues on my own time. I always ask for clarification when I need it, and I go to the doctor with the mentality that they are working for me.
1	I feel I have a great capacity to obtain, understand, and process my health info and services. I have head chronic Auto Immune Disorders since I was 14, and have been to many hospitals, doctors, and specialists. Having gone through the process so many years give you the experience necessary to process and understand all the information given to you.
1	I feel very capable of understanding health information.  I have a science background and read many books about health, disease control, etc.  I do believe there are racial disparities in health care that affect my access to the information, testing, etc., that I need, but with respect to understanding information, etc., I usually have no problem.  
-1	I think I have almost complete capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information.  I think I can almost always make health decisions on my own without any help from anyone else. 
-1	I feel that I can understand a large portion of the information given to me. I do struggle sometimes when being told information about medication and specific diagnosis. I don't like to ask the specific questions because I don't like to seem like I'm not smart.
1	I think have have an appropriate amount of mental capacity to make health decisions.  I consider myself a smart individual and believe I use good reasoning when it comes to making decisions about my health.  I read well and understand medical literature.  I don't have a problem asking if I need more clarification.
-1	I feel that most of the time, I am able to get a good understanding about health conditions I may have by reading the information I am given by my doctor, asking questions and doing additional research online. I usually feel rushed when I am in the office with the doctor so many times I may need to get additional answers after my initial visit. 
-1	I do feel I have the ability to effectively understand the basic information they provide as anything that I don't quite understand I ask in detail about the information in order to form a better understanding of my condition.  I do feel that sometimes I do need things to be broken down into simpler terms but for the most part I feel I have enough of a grasp to make an informed decision. 
-1	It really depends on how I feel. If I am in pain or severe discomfort my ability to understand complex issues drops dramatically. I don't go into a doctors office often for a checkup, so most likely the reason I am there is that I am not well. This can lead to my understanding of complex issues and situations being less than great.
1	I feel that I am very good at understanding what a doctor explains to me because always listen close when it is something that relates to my health. I am also not afraid to ask questions if I do not full understand something. I am also very good at searching the internet to find things to help me understand things i did not understand at first. 
-1	I understand I have basic knowledge and I also keep learning about different information when it comes to the decision making in my health and other peoples health aswell. I try to always keep learning.
1	I think in most cases I can understand what needs to be know. I enjoy reading when I can about even the possibility of a condition. What I don't understand I am capable of reaching out find out. 
-1	I think I'm pretty good with getting and understanding information to make proper choices. It does help though if I was given a list of alternatives like similar drugs, comparable specialists, or other methods of treatment. It helps if all documents are typed out and not hand written. It is so hard to read information when they have sloppy hand writing. I also like to have a bit of time to look over all documents, ask the right questions and come up with the best solution for myself. I don't like to be put under pressure to make a choice quickly.
-1	I mostly can understand, but I will often search online something I may not fully understand. I will also ask questions to my provider but will often follow up with looking for information online. 
1	I am smarter than the average so I usually understand even complicated subjects quite well.  I am well educated as well.  I also have a great deal of experience from having to deal with some health issues with my parents.  I am quite familiar with common medical forms.  If I am unfamiliar with something at first, I can usually understand it after studying it for awhile.

1	I feel that all of the information I need about health related topics is easily accessible. The internet makes getting this information very easy.
-1	I feel that many doctors and physicians use very technical terms, and do not want to spend the time to explain everything.  I trust a lot of what the doctor tells me with very little questions so that I do not waste their time.  I rely on using the internet to search out or answers any questions I may have
1	When necessary, I am fully able to obtain and understand health information and medical services.  There have been a few instances where difficulties arose (with a specific dentist who was hesitant to provide accurate information because he was pushing for unnecessary and expensive dental work), but these situations have been exceedingly rare over the course of my life.
-1	I believe I have a fair deal of capabilities to understand, obtain, and process basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. Depending on the information provided, I generally always do what my doctor tells me what to do and if I don't feel better then I see a different doctor and try to get a different opinion. 
-1	I feel like I have the capacity but sometimes I have to seek out the information I need or push to have questions answered. I don't like that sometimes I feel like a doctor won't tell me the exact truth and instead they'll sugar coat things.
1	I feel that I am in the prime of my life and that my thinking is clear and unobstructed.  I believe I can clearly convey my thoughts.  Therefore I believe that the channels of communication are open and that I can understand difficult concepts.
1	I have a wonderful relationship with my doctor who can communicate complicated ideas quite easily.  But even if I were dealing with someone else, I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information.  I feel very knowledgeable about my health; I'm confident I can make the right decisions for me and for my loved ones.
1	I have the ability to fully obtain, process, and understand any basic health information that is given to me.

-1	I feel I can understand information to a basic degree. If something is too complicated, I am able to research the information myself and read it thoroughly to my understanding.
-1	I guess first I try to understand everything on my own. If I am still in the doctor's office I will ask a question.  Usually only once though.  I don't want to sound stupid by asking the same question over and over again, or repeated questions of different kinds.  Usually I manage pretty well on my own. but, sometimes I don't always understand medical jargon, or what certain blood reports show, but I have a couple of nurse friends that can help me.  I also know a pharmacist if I have a question about a drug.  
1	I have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information because six years ago I was a insurance agent. I was licensed in health care. I had to have educational training on new information(policies) that effect the client's selection of choice based on his/hers health.

1	I can usually understand and process the information that I'm told or reading. Sometimes when reading, it's explained in such a way that is a little confusing, but when talking to someone, it's usually an easy concept to grasp.All in all, I generally understand the information I'm given pretty well.
-1	I feel very shy when I am at the doctors. I always write down things I want to say but then chicken out or forget. I feel intimidated at the doctors.
-1	I feel like have the capacity and understand to understand medical information. However, I always feel like doctors do not take out the time to answer questions properly because I always feel rushed to get out. A lot of the time I find my self researching what the doctors were rushing to explain.
-1	I think overall I have a good capacity to understand and process basic health information that medical staff present to me. Obtaining the information is relatively easy in my opinion. In terms of making proper health choices I feel that that is more of a grey area. The reason I say that is because I feel most doctors are very biased and will recommend things that may not be the best possible option for me.
-1	I feel as though I have the full capacity to fully understand what health literature is presented to me in the hopes of fully understanding my health outcomes.
1	I feel have the capacity to understand health information and services to a very high degree. I often research health conditions and review information given to me by doctors. I feel is in my best interest to be as well informed as possible in order to make good choices for me and my family. 
-1	I feel that I can obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed very well as long as the information is not given to me in terms that I don't understand, such as by using the name of a specific bacteria instead of just saying bacteria.

1	I feel I have good capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. Generally medical professionals are helpful in that regard, as if you ever have any questions, most are willing to explain it in detail. Also the age we live in, any questions about medical stuff are only a google search away. From the google search you can find actual medical documents explaining certain things, or just find other people like yourself suffering from the same thing who will share their experiences. Also not trying to brag but I've also been a smart person, so I find understanding things like this, isn't that tough. Generally though, I just try to make sure my Doctor and/or Nurses are fully informed of what is going on with me, and make sure to ask any questions I have.
1	I understand what I need to understand and what I have trouble with I will inquire about until I do understand. I was never one to be shy about asking questions because there are just too many things out there to expect that any one of us could know all the answers ourselves.
-1	I comprehend most basic health information. I have been given diagnosis that I have had to say âwhat is thatâ on numerous occasions. The doctor explains and sometimes I fully understand and sometimes I donât. I have written down the diagnosis and researched further on Internet from Home. 
-1	I have so many health problems due to the Lupus, Sjogren's, and frequent infections. There are so many terms and conditions I am experiencing it is hard sometimes to retain the information. I oftentimes have to ask for clarification. I also have IBD and liver issues. Even if a doctor is rude, and I have had plenty of mean ones, I ask everything I can think of. It could be a matter of life and death, or just not feeling well. I have to get over my embarrassment and intimidation and ask what I need to. 
-1	For the most part I think I am able to understand basic health information.  Sometimes there are aspects of it that I don't grasp and that sometimes even asking for clarification I might still not get, but figure I can do more research online later as long as I remember the basics of what they told me.
1	I feel that I have excellent ability to understand and process basic health information. I worked in the pharmacy field for several years and have medical professionals in my family and this helped me understand some medical terms and jargon much better.
-1	I usually am able to process the information that is given to me at the doctor's offices. I try to research as much as I can about what I do or might have before a visit that way when I actually go it's not as much of a surprise. There are occasional times I have a doctor explain something more in depth. There was only one time that I had a foot surgery and the surgeon was in and out in a minute I didn't even know what to ask. 
1	I am self sufficient in filling out forms. If I do not understand them, I have no issue calling someone or talking to someone at the office of where the forms need to go. Usually all the forms I fill out for medical stuff, is pretty generic and I have no problems understanding the questions they are asking. If I did have a problem, I can always call the doctors office and talk to someone. Usually I fill them out there at the doctor, so if I had any questions, I would not hesistate to ask the front desk. If they didn't know, I would talk to the nurse or the doctor to get the help I needed.
1	I am sixty three years old and have been to the doctor both on my behalf on the behalf of many family members with varying (including very serious as well as unusual) medical conditions, so I have had a lot of experience and know the vital importance of obtaining service and processing how to use it
1	I ask my doctor or nurse to explain exactly what my health problem is.  With prescriptions, I ask the doctor what they are for, talk to the pharmacists to get a clearer idea of what the medicines do.  I also look up online at webmd or other medical websites. 
1	i am pretty knowledgeable on health issues. if i dont know something, i am quick to research it on my own. google is my best friend and i use it a lot.
1	I enjoy learning about health in my spare time so I tend to understand a bit more then the average person and I am not afraid to ask for more information or research it myself if I don't understand something. I am very confident that i can understand basic health information and make good health decisions based on my needs.
-1	I feel that most of the questions I have are answered. I am pretty knowledgeable myself but there are times where if feel like I need to ask about them. When I do. i feel i have the right resources to make it happen and feel confident if they don't know the answer. they can find someone who does.
-1	I have a difficult time understanding medical terminology because it is so complicated and scientific. I often times need someone to verbally explain to me what a specific term or symptom means. Most of the time I feel lost and that I do not understand the cause of my symptoms or that I am just clueless why the health issue is occurring. When a doctor tries to explain it to me, I lose focus quickly because they are speaking too fast and talking about medical issues I am not educated about.
-1	I feel truly confident in my capacity to make appropriate health decisions. I can understand what the doctor says, and if I do not understand I am able to ask questions and clear my doubts. 
1	If I ever need help understanding anything at the pharmacy, they always are willing to take the time to explain any side effects or questions I have about specific medications.  When I see my doctor, it can sometimes be a little more rushed because he has so many patients during the day he has to see and he runs a very tight schedule.  However, I never felt like he answered any of my questions inadequately.  I usually do research on my own (online), before I go in for an appointment, so that I am better prepared to ask relevant questions regarding my potential diagnosis or ailments.  Therefore I know what to ask and usually have a good understanding of the health information presented to me.
1	I feel confident enough to understand basic and somewhat more complex health related information, services to ensure that I will be taking the correct approach to treating such health conditions. Anything that is out of the ordinary or too complex I would probably ask for a more thorough breakdown of what it is what I will be dealing with.
-1	I feel I can understand medical information if it is laid out in a comprehensible format. However, I often think that important details are left out of the information I get due to lack of time by my medical professionals or a breakdown in communication due to the bureaucracy of the healthcare industry.
-1	I have the knowledge to listen to what they are saying and digest it and I make sure I ask questions if I have any and ask them to write some of the information down that allows me to then do online research and better understand it for the next time im in there
-1	I feel very confident in my own capacity to obtain and process basic health information. I have never had a problem with this in the past. 
1	I feel that I can work through most health related decisions fairly well. Written materials are usually concise enough but I ask a lot of questions if I don't understand.
1	I find basic health information easy to obtain and understand. If the information that the doctor or nurse provides does not make sense to me I ask questions until they can explain it in my terms. As far as I know, I've never had an issue gaining information for basic health decisions.
-1	I haven't experienced many hospital visits, but when there I haven't had a difficult time understanding my medical issues. I have experienced long wait times even when I have had a scheduled appointment.
-1	I have the capacity to obtain and process material but sometimes there are medical vocabulary that I need someone to explain.
1	I have a high degree of understanding. I'm confident in my ability understand basic health information. My family has a history of diabetes that has included multiple doctor trips and different doctors. This includes filing forms for new doctors or new patient check ups or getting into the urgent care clinic. I've paid out of pocket and I've used insurance when needed. I seldom experience any issues.
-1	I know how to get the information or help I need. I do like outside imput when there are medical decisions to be made. In the past Iâve felt Drâs donât adequately explain issues.
-1	I feel like I have an above average understanding of medical terms and technology, although I'm not in med school or anything.  I feel that a lot of the information available assumes that we are doctors and isn't really put into terms that the typical person can understand.  Some information is missing too, like how nasal steroids can cause dependence and shouldn't be used for more than a week or two.  These spurts of missing information can lead to very misinformed decisions.  I feel like the medical community could provide better resources.
1	I feel I have a high degree to make appropriate decisions based on my 5 year university degree and subsequent work in a field providing health care. Therefore I feel comfortable making sure I ask all the right questions to understand my treatment to the best of my ability
-1	I think I have the ability to understand all of the basic health information that I am provided, and to use that information to make decisions about my health. I also have the full capacity to understand the various health services offered. 
-1	Given the fact that I work in the scientific field, I feel as if I'm predisposed to have a good basic understanding of medical terminology combined with an exceptional command of the English language. The only problem arises when the care provider is unable to fully describe the mechanisms of drugs for which they prescribe. That would be one of the few circumstances where I need assistance in making the best decision for my health.    
1	I have been thru enough doctor and gospel visits that I can surely read and comprehend everything in the paper work and when speaking to a healthcare specialist
-1	I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate heath decisions. 
-1	I feel, I understand most of the medical information I am given. If I do not I either ask the appropriate professional (Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, etc.) or I use a reputable website such WebMD.
-1	I think I am capable but hesitant when it comes to gathering health information. I can definitely do it but I am unsure because of the frequency in which I actually make use of certain information.
-1	I think I have full capacity for to make these decisions. I am also confident in my  judgement for knowing what I don't know and identifying whether or not it is important to learn/seek more information.
-1	I feel pretty confidant that I can obtain and process any information provided to me by nurses, doctors and any other hospital staff. I understand basic health information when received. If explained to me I would understand the services needed to make the right health decisions. 
1	I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I will not approve of services that I don't fully understand the reason for or fully agree with the risks. i.e.risk vs. benefit
1	I have very good nurses and doctors that are always willing to help and answer any questions. Our insurance also provides us with a nurses hotline if we need to ask any questions. When I fill prescriptions the pharmacists are always very helpful and make sure I understand everything. I also have several nurse friends that are always willing to answer any questions. 
-1	I think I'm fairly confident in being able to find and understand information. If I have any questions then I usually go online and do a lot of research. I like to be fully prepared and have good understanding to be able to ask any important questions.
1	I feel good about receiving and looking for any health information that is given to me. If I have been diagnosed with something, I always ask as many questions as possible as well as looking up information on the Internet and library. 
1	I feel very confident in my ability. Especially nowadays, when you can google and read more about any topic, I am sure that I could understand any medical information and make solid decisions. I might feel a little pressured in an appointment where the medical professional didn't have a lot of time to spend with me, but I would just go home and learn more about the topic through research, and call back for more info if necessary. I also have a great, experienced family who would help me understand anything I had questions about.
-1	I have the basic understanding of medical services. Most times if I need help to understand something I ask a family member or I go on  the internet. I live by myself so I usually call a family member with my questions. I find that the internet is really helpful with my meds and diagnosis that I have received.  Online it is really easy to understand. The only problem with that is that there's a lot of information on the web and it can get confusing sometimes. So mostly I will ask my family members or the doctor.
-1	I believe I am fully capable of understanding basic health information and services needed to make health decisions for myself. If I am unclear about something, I will research it myself or ask others for help or I will seek understanding from a health care professional. 
-1	I feel like I have a basic capacity to understand most things, but often times when an issue arises I have difficulties understanding what went wrong. Especially with regards to more specific and less common medical and health concerns.
-1	I prefer to talk about my health issues, concerns, problems with my husband. Often he sees things in a different light and his input helps me see all of my options and understand things better. I do feel I am capable of making any decision on my own but I'm more comfortable talking things over with my husband.
1	I am responsible for taking care of the healthcare needs of myself and my kids. I have become capable of making any and all decisions. Anything the Dr. may mention or diagnoses I see on forms I receive, I will go out and google to get information on what may have caused it or what other recommendations for treatments might be offered other than those offered by my physician. I take care of my kids' needs and I am not afraid to ask questions when it comes to their health. There have even been times where I can't make it to their visits with them, but I am on the phone when the Dr. is talking to them and directing them to ask questions so that I feel I'm fully informed.
-1	I definitely feel I have the ability to understand and process my health information. I am of sound mind and pay attention. I tend to Google medical issues and problems before seeking a doctor, so I often have a general idea of what is wrong with me and even know some of the terminology before they tell me. Even after I am diagnosed, I do a ton of research to get more facts than the doctor would have told me and even hear or speak to others with the same problems.
-1	I feel like I understand most of the processes and information regarding my health. There are times that I don't completely understand, but I have my mom help me with those instances. I have a rare illness, so sometimes it's complicated to answer certain questions just due to the severity of my illness and the fact that my illness isn't completely understood by medical professionals.
1	I am fluent in English and have college schooling so I am very confident in understanding basic health information. There is also a lot of information on the internet that has helped me make appropriate and more informed decisions. 
1	I can understand whatever the doctor tells me, whether spoken or written, If I need to I can research further online later. But a lot of that depends on the doctor too, some doctors explain things well, others just kind of assume you already know.
-1	Although medical jargon can be difficult to understand I feel pretty confident in filling out any medical forms necessary.  My reading comprehension is very high so I feel confident that even if there's terms or conditions I don't understand I can usually figure out the meaning by reading the context of the sentence.  Also, if I need to I can do research on my own and usually do concerning any symptoms I display.
1	I have above average ability to understand written information. If I don't understand a work or jargon, I look it up on the internet. I reread to make sure I know how the condition may affect me. I feel pretty confident I understand the side effects of drugs before I take them. 
-1	I feel I am very capable.   Most older family have me go with them to important doctors appointments because I make sure to ask when confused and not leave to we have everything we need and fully understand.  If something pops up after leaving I do not hesitate to contact the doctor again by phone.  Understanding health is so important  so I make it a priority to get the info needed.
-1	I believe I can easily understand general and common medical terms and I feel I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decision. I usually seek for a second opinion or wait on exams before making any decisions pertaining my health or procedures I agree upon. I am very prone to do extra research should any health issues appear and try to gather all the information I can and bring all questions to a doctor, although it mesmerizes me the lack in tests and exams I see in the health industry, most diagnostics are given based on symptoms and not exams. 
-1	Health information is so important that sometimes it may be overthought of something too simple. However, in most cases there are times where I do need help in regards to medical forms that need to be filled out of have questions for the doctor. therefore, a lot of questions that can be given in a written format may require too much of a distinct jargon that couldn't be understand. Making the right health deicisons are important especially if it medical history in your family such as diabetes,  high blood pressure, and other health risk. it is always right seek out the best information. 
1	I have had no issues in the past with understanding what I am supposed to do and medicines I am supposed to take.
1	I'm 52 and have a fair amont of experience with health issues and the care provided. I've yet to fail to fully understand everthing provided to me in a healthcare setting.
-1	I think that I am capable of figuring out and making concious healthcare decisions when I am faced with it. I understand the services and what is required of me and I fully comprehend what my health care provider is telling me.
-1	I feel like I am moderately able to understand and process the information. With the help of better educated friends and family I am able to get a better understanding without much trouble.
-1	Most of the time I feel out of place. The explanations the doctors give have such high medical vocabulary that it is difficult to understand what they are saying. I feel I get lost in the middle of their explanation. When something is hand written by a doctor for a prescription it is even worse since half of the time I cant understand what they are writing wether it is the name of a medicine or the instructions on how to take them. The procedures are also hard to understand. It all comes down to the amount of endless information I fell I am given by the doctors. Its too much to take at once, most of the time.
1	"I have no problem understanding health information that is given to me.  The problem is when doctors are more concerned with a ""treat and street"" philosophy merely going through the motions to check off boxes for insurance companies than actually LISTENING to patients and taking the time to ask the questions that need to be answered in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  Patients often do not know that a symptom is just that so when a doctor fails to asks the right questions there will likely not be an accurate diagnosis.  Another issue is when a doctor blatantly ignores my questions.  How many ways to I have to ask the most basic question of what does this diagnosis mean?  More often than not it's just easier to go home and search webmd or the Mayo Clinic website.  Problem with that is I generally end up with even more unanswered questions.  Ultimately I am quite capable of understanding information when it is provided and if my questions are answered with more than a couple of words.  (The correct answer to ""what does the thyroid do?"" is NOT ""Pep"" and after a look of disbelief ""You know, energy"")"
1	As an attorney for 30 years I represented many medical providers dealing with associate rules, HIPAA rules etc. I am well versed in contracts and medical issues/terms 
1	I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and services that are needed to make appropriate health decisions.  I do not have any mental issues that make me incapable of understanding things and making decisions.  I have 100% of my mental capacity and am very good at understanding medical information.
1	I think I have the skills that I need to take care of myself. I haven't had much trouble understanding any of my medical conditions. I would consider myself fairly literate when it comes to my health.
-1	I have a good understanding of my healthcare and decisions. I mainly attribute this to the fact that I work in the medical field.
-1	I am a visual learner, yes, but I have more than enough competency to ask and re-ask questions that I need until I have information that is not only useful but coherent. I will read instructions and carefully write myself notes so I don't forget anything. 
1	I feel I have a strong ability to obtain, process and understand basic health and services information in order to make appropriate decisions.  If I have any questions, I actively seek out information.
-1	I feel I can get all information I need and understand instructions. The problem area that I usually have is when it comes to insurance papers. Luckily I have a sister that works in the insurance dept. of our local clinic and am able to get help from her. I often think of what the poor people do that don't have access to someone like that and what I would do if she wasn't there to help.
1	I'm a senior citizen now I'm told. I'm 63 years old. I have always tried to make sure I communicate with my doctor, dentist, etc regarding anything to do with my health. I do ask questions or I call, or e-mail people to explain things to me. I also do this for my husband who is 69 years old. Since he signed up for Medicare I had to make many phone calls to understand different things. 
-1	I feel I have a pretty good capacity. I am too shy to ask the questions I should of my provider. And I rarely share all of my concerns with my  psychiatrist because if I do he'll probably have me change my medications or increase my visits. And I don't give my general practitioner all the info she needs to help me as it may cause more tests or drugs.
-1	I believe that I am in good standing when it comes to obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. I believe this is because, I have learned and are aware of asking questions, reading labels, and doing my own research.
1	When I go into the doctors, I always have a list of questions that I need to have answered and hopefully I can come up with more if I am very concerned about the condition. Most of the doctors or nurses that I have encountered have been very helpful and open to answering all my questions and relieving any concern that I did have. I have taken health courses and do have a general idea of what is going on. Also, I try to do as much research as possible before an appointment so I don't go in there completely naÃ¯ve to the condition. 
1	I believe I have a huge capacity to understand basic health related information. I have worked in the health care field since I was 15 years old and have had many hours of training in medical terminology. I enjoy health related topics and understanding human anatomy. Itâs a passion to heal people.
-1	I think my only concern is the way that technical terms are explained to the patients, since they don't know educationally
1	I think I am able to understand the heath related questions. Sometimes I may not be clear on the problem or I might come home and forget to ask a question to the doctor 
1	Between google scholar and the amount of time I spend reading about health and medicine I feel fairly confident that I know what the doctor is talking about, and when I don't, that I have the base knowledge to ask the right questions. 
-1	My doctor is very good at taking her time and explaining things. My family is in a few health occupations and explain a lot to me too. I read about staying healthy.
1	I believe that I am capable and qualified to understand basic health information and services needed and to make appropriate health decisions because I have a scientific and medical background which has familiarized me with a variety of medical concepts and terminology. My familiarity with medical concepts comes from my undergraduate degree in biochemistry as well as my prior professional employment in the pharmaceutical industry.
-1	I am a pretty fast learner and most of the time I am able to understand all the medical forms. Sometimes I will have someone go over it with me to explain in more shortened terms
1	I feel I have the capacity to understand materials presented to me. I also feel like I know how to form questions to get the answers I need. I do not struggle communicating with health care professionals.
1	I feel that I am well able to process all the information needed to make intelligent health decisions. I can easily understand written and spoken information, and I research health topics that concern me.
-1	I feel mostly confident in my capacity to do the above. With the Internet as a resource if there is something in a pamphlet that seems unclear to me I can often do some reading to clear up any confusion. I am comfortable with my doctor and he answers my questions well. I have had doctors in the past that answered my medical questions as though I were another doctor. Sometimes that made understanding my conditions or the decisions that were being made regarding them difficult to understand. I think doctors just need to remember that sometimes the most simple way for them to explain something might not be as easy to understand for some of their patients.
-1	sometimes I have some particular difficulties to understand what it is written on the doctor's diagnosis. In some situations, i have some difficulties to better understand medical terms used by my doctors so I often  ask them to explain them to me
1	I think I'm pretty good at understanding things. I usually repeat the information back to health professionals in my own words so they can correct me if I haven't gotten it right. I read written information provided by hospitals or doctor offices; I don't always read all the prescription fine print. When I'm back home, I look online (usually WebMD) and read up on topics that were raised.
1	I feel that I am fully capable of obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information and the services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  
1	I am a college educated individual and believe that I have the mental capacity to understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I have health insurance and regularly go to my primary care physician and eye doctor for frequent check-ups. The key is to be honest with your doctors on any potential issues that I might be having.
-1	I feel very confident in understanding the science of medications and medical problems. However, insurances deliberately try to make forms, processes and procedures difficult for the patient and medical professionals in order to avoid paying. The fear of being stuck with the bill is enough to deter me and most others from seeking medical attention. 
1	I understand my medical history and my doctor has taken the necessary time to discuss it with me.  I am a member of a good health group and can also find a lot of information on the website.
1	I feel most confident regarding my healthcare and health conditions. I worked in the field of medical care for over ten years and had the privilege of working with many great physicians and nurses. I have a good understanding of medical terms and feel comfortable with reading medically focused materials, including conditions or diagnoses that I may be faced with.
1	I feel highly confident that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. If I ever have any questions, I make sure to ask either a health professional, someone who has personal experience with what I am inquiring about, or check online for further explanations/information. I have a personal interest in health care (i.e., taking proper care of myself and others as well as attempting to understand things that I may hear about and could be something of use in the future). Both my father and brother work in the medical field and I actively listen(ed) when they share what they know. My educational background is primarily in Psychology, but I have taken a few medical courses as well. I feel that having a good understanding of how the human body works is important and know that, if something is ever slightly difficult to understand on my own, I can find answers somewhere.
1	I feel that I have a high degree of confidence in my capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic healthy information and services I need to make appropriate health decision.
-1	I can understand most of the basic questions. The problem that I have is when the doctor or nurse use medical terms in which I've never heard of or when I'm filling out forms. So I can and feel confident that I can obtain basic or certain information to make the appropriate health decisions. I just can't do it when it gets too technical. 
-1	I feel I have enough experience with going to many  Doctors that I can get most of the information that I need to determine what is the best way to approach the medical situation.
-1	I feel very confident about my ability to make health decisions. All of my doctors belong to the same health system and have access to my medical records.  This is useful for when they need to prescribe something - they have immediate access to see what else I'm taking to be sure something new won't interfere.
1	I feel that my capacity extends as far as what I feel comfortable with. These health questions and decisions, I feel, are rarely out of someone with a normal high school education's capacity to handle. I feel that if the health decision is not to the best of my judgment, then I will seek the appropriate health professional. I also feel that most health care professionals would take the time to better explain to their patients, if there was some kind of misunderstanding. This would in turn lead to a more patient/doctor trustworthiness, which would benefit the overall performance of the hospital.
1	I have easy access to the answers that I need for any medical information.  A hospital is very close to my whose and I can use Google to find out whatever I need to know.  Also, I have friends and acquaintances who are on the medical field who I can ask questions.  Anytime a doctor explains something to me, they usually say it in a way that I can easily understand.  Also, they never use big medical words that I can't understand.  It's very easy to simply ask the doctor everything you need to know about any medical condition that you have.  
1	I believe at this point in time, health information is there if you are willing to seek it out. The web is ever expanding in regards to the information available, health provider apps are becoming more robust, and I happen to work at a call center (Carenet) that works to fill gaps in the consumer healthcare experience through providing various health provider services. However, for most people, I believe they are somewhat in the dark. The doctor's offices I've always been too do a terrible job of providing knowledge unless it's a doctor trying to prove they know the jargon. Clerical staff usually seem to avoid customers at any cost and ironically have terrible customer service (for the most part). Most offices have the same 30 year old graphics of the inner ear workings alongside  numerous posters advertising designer drugs. It'd be nicer if doctors offices were part medical care, part personal medical library. Plus, nobody really likes to reach out for health/insurance related information. I think it takes the external people who have a stake in that persons health (insurance providers) reaching out with info and care plans.
-1	I think that i definitely have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed. My biggest issue that sometimes i dont get is that sometimes doctors will prescribe medication without knowing what my diagnosis is. That is something i have a hard time understanding sometimes and it can be hard to get a straight answer out of my doctor.
-1	I believe in listening to what my doctor tells me about my health. When I don't understand the information I'm given, I ask for it to be explained until I get it.  I like to know what type of medicine to buy, what to eat, what not to eat, what I should be doing for my health. Also the internet helps a lot, if I need more clarification on something I research it more and get more information
-1	i can understand basic health information provided by my doctor or nurse. Sometimes i need someone to explain to me  what exactly my medical papers telling me and what i need to do and sometimes hard to make my health decision i don't understand all my medical papers provided by my doctor or nurse and needing someone else to explain to me. 
-1	I have a severe traumatic brain injury and get a fair amount of mental health treatment.  I don't necessarily understand all of the information I am presented, but I always have someone that can explain things to me.  Either the doctors or an aide that helps me with handling everyday tasks.
1	I think my ability to understand and comprehend medical terminology when it comes to reading medical information given to me by a doctor is sufficient.  The majority of times  I get information from a doctor though it may have some medical terminology most of the information is easy to comprehend.  This is what gives me the confidence to say that I can be able to understand most of what the doctor writes me in a medical form.
-1	Are usually donât have any issues when it comes to reading information documents reports that concerning my medical issues it is pretty much easily comprehendible and usually thereâs always somebody on standby you call his ass questions
1	I feel that I have possess the codependency to comprehend basic health information, and slightly higher capacity at interpreting medical terminology.
1	I feel that I am capable of obtaining, processing and understanding basic health information given to me by a health care provider so I am able to make an informed decision. I generally know what questions I need to ask to get the information I need, and try to give doctors and nurses enough information for them to treat me effectively. I occasionally ask for assistance from my wife recalling dates of shots and so on when filling out forms, but I donât think that is unusual. I think I am as capable as most people of making appropriate health decisions. I have some hearing loss, so it is helpful to have my wife along when discussing things with a health care worker so I donât misunderstand or nor hear something, but I can comprehend what is being said and am able to make necessary decisions.
-1	When it comes to basic issues I feel as though I have the ability to interpret them on my own.  However, when we start to get into more complex issues I often need someone with knowledge to make the explanation easier for me.
1	I am pretty confident with reading medical materials I constantly freeze proof read every documents and ask a lot of questions anything I don't understand I always Google it
-1	I feel that I have the intellectual capacity to comprehend what I'm told.  The problem is that both I and the medical professionals I'm speaking with are working with a time limit that does not allow for an actual question-and-answer session or a real mutual understanding.
1	I AM TOTALLY CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH INFORMATION AS I HAVE A MASTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS WORKED MOST OF MY WORKING YEARS IN THE HEALTH FIELD.

-1	I feel that with the internet and the ability to call my hospital with any questions, I have quite amount of information in order to make appropriate health decisions
-1	I feel I am very capable of everything I Need. i am used to going to the doctor and asking the questions necessary so that I get the information I Need in relation to my health problems. I go to the doctor so frequently that this is never an issue for me and if I do not understand something I'm very sure to ask questions. Sometimes if it's a new doctor I feel they don't always respond the way they need to or take the time they should but I make sure I get what i need.
1	I think I have a pretty good understanding of many conditions, especially those that I am dealing with. I have diagnosed myself long before a doctor could. I enjoy learning about medicine and feel confident in my decision making.

I don't have any issue asking for help and if I don't understand something I'm not afraid to admit it and ask for an easier explanation in terms I can fully understand.
-1	Sometimes I feel like I do not understand some of the documents given to me. They might ask things that I am not sure how to answer or if I am making the right decision. For example, if the doctor gives me a document about a vaccine he is recommending then I like to have someone look over it with me and I like to look up information about it instead of giving an immediate answer by myself. Other times, I completely understand the information given to me and I can make an immediate answer without hesitation. 
1	I think that I have the capacity to understand any of the basic and non basic health information from any of the services and am able to make good decisions also.
